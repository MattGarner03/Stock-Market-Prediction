===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Invitation Homes First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Scott McLaughlin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Scott McLaughlin: Thank you, operator and good morning. I’m joined today from Invitation Homes with Dallas Tanner, Chief Executive Officer; Charles Young, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jon Olsen, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Eisen, Chief Investment Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session with our covering sell-side analysts. During today’s call, we may reference our first quarter 2025 earnings release and supplemental information. We issued this document was issued yesterday after the market closed, and it is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2024 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Except to the extent otherwise required by law, we do not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, in yesterday's earnings release. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dallas Tanner. Please begin Dallas.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to share another quarter of solid performance, further demonstrating the resilience of the single-family rental market and the strength of our operating platform as well as the dedication of our associates and the trust our residents place in us every day. During the first quarter, our same-store portfolio delivered 97.2% average occupancy, 3.6% blended rent growth and 3.7% year-over-year increase in NOI. Core FFO per share grew 3.5% year-over-year and AFFO per share grew 4%. These metrics underscore our ability to achieve solid rent growth, sector leading occupancy and strong financial performance, even in a volatile environment. And I'm grateful to our team for the terrific start to the year. The demand for single-family homes is driven by several factors. We've often discussed the favorable demographics, the shift towards value and convenience and flexibility over long-term commitments and the high cost of homeownership. On average, in our markets, it's currently over $1,000 per month less expensive to lease a home than it is to own. Whether that's due to elevated mortgage rates or rising homeowners’ insurance premiums and property taxes, we provide a valuable alternative to the 14 million individuals and families who choose the leasing lifestyle. Housing is a fundamental human need, and we believe there is a strong desire for well-located, high-quality, professionally-serviced homes for lease. We've observed this to be true in many recent cycles, including in Houston during the energy crisis, across all of our markets during the pandemic and in my previous business in Phoenix during the global financial crisis prior to cofounding Invitation Homes. In general, in periods of economic uncertainty, SFR occupancy has tended to remain steady and rents have held flat or even increased slightly. In short, we believe Invitation Homes can deliver stable, sticky and growing property cash flows in both prosperous and challenging times. Consistent with our corporate DNA, we believe that capital recycling and prudent portfolio growth are essential parts of our overall strategy. Our approach of partnering with homebuilders to redeploy disposition proceeds in the new well-located homes has shown to be both effective and accretive. During the quarter, we acquired 577 wholly owned homes for approximately $194 million nearly all of which were newly built, while strategically disposing of 454 homes, many to first time homeowners. Additionally, we're helping our partners develop nearly 2,000 additional homes in many of our West Coast and Sunbelt markets. This provides us with a reliable pipeline of future growth opportunities with virtually none of the risks of on balance sheet development, which we believe is an advantage in the current environment. In addition to new BTR communities and scattered site development, we continue to evaluate stabilized portfolio acquisitions and are exploring several opportunities that we hope to be able to discuss later this year. As always, we remain dedicated to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy, consistently focusing on investments that meet our risk adjusted return criteria. We continue to target a 6% average yield on cost that's supported by the significant economies of scale we and our partners enjoy. Our ability to derisk larger communities and acquire brand-new scatter-site homes, combined with the synergies we create through best-in-class operations, further support this objective. Looking ahead, we remain committed to our priorities with a measured outlook. We believe our consistent operating performance, execution of our strategic initiatives and diversified acquisition pipeline form a robust foundation for sustainable growth. Despite the occasional volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets, Invitation Homes is dedicated to focusing on long-term value and opportunities. With that, I've concluded my prepared remarks. Charles, over to you, please.
Charles Young: Thanks. As Dallas mentioned, we posted a strong first quarter achieving 3.7% same store NOI growth, driven by core revenue growth of 2.5%. Thanks to the hard work of our associates, our peak leasing season kicks solidly in the gear with new lease rate growth that's accelerated each month since December. In addition, bad debt has continued to improve underscoring both the strength of our customer and the defensive nature of housing generally. Other sources of property income such as value add services like smart home and bundled Internet, continued to enhance our overall revenue performance while also providing desirable offerings to our residents. On the expense front, we maintained our disciplined approach to cost controls during the first quarter. Same-store core operating expenses were flat year-over-year in part due to our team's continued focus on leveraging operational efficiencies and scale advantages across our portfolio. Additionally, we experienced milder weather in most of our markets during the first quarter versus the same time last year, which helped us achieve a 2% reduction in repair and maintenance expense year-over-year. Turnover expenses also contributed to our favorable overall expense result, decreasing 5.1% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by the large number of residents who opted to renew their leases with us. This positive trend in renewals was further supported by our same-store leasing performance year-over-year. During Q1, we posted a 5.2% increase in renewal rents and new lease rents generally held steady. This resulted in blended rental rate growth of 3.6% for the quarter. In addition, average occupancy remained healthy at 97.2% reflecting sustained demand for our homes. Our average length of stay is now 38.5 months with a nearly 80% renewal rate during the first quarter, which we believe validates our long-standing resident centric approach. Drilling in now to a few of our specific markets. Our western U.S. markets are experiencing strong occupancy and robust renewal and new lease rate growth. With the exception of Phoenix, which we've previously called out along with Texas and Florida, where we continue to keep a close eye on some of the ongoing supply pressures. Nevertheless, we've seen some encouraging signs in these markets so far this year, with solid absorption and steady improvement, including a return last month to positive new lease rate growth. Meanwhile, the Midwest has been performing well and our Southeast markets are achieving solid results that are in line with expectations. As we move further into peak leasing season, preliminary same-store results for the month of April reinforced the encouraging trends I just outlined. Blended rent growth was 4% in April, composed of 4.5% renewal rent growth and 2.7% new lease rent growth. In addition, April occupancy remained very healthy at an average of 97.4%. These higher year-to-date occupancy levels are slightly ahead of our initial expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected turnover. As Dallas mentioned earlier, it's common for SFR residents to stay put during times of uncertainty. We'll continue to monitor how this trend might affect our usual seasonality patterns, especially as we anticipate some moderation in occupancy this summer when move outs typically peak. With all of this in mind, we believe we remain well positioned to capture market rate growth. Looking ahead, we're optimistic about maintaining this positive trajectory. Our teams are well prepared to capitalize on seasonal demand, while maintaining our high standards for resident quality and service. I'll now turn the call over to you, John.
Jonathan Olsen: Thanks, Charles. Today, I'll provide a review of our balance sheet and financial results for the first quarter of 2025 and then discuss some high-level thoughts on our guidance for the remainder of the year. I'll start with our balance sheet. As of March 31, our total available liquidity stood at nearly $1.4 billion comprised of unrestricted cash on our balance sheet and undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.3x, and we have no debt reaching final maturity until 2027. As of quarter end, 87.5% of our debt was fixed rate or swapped to fixed rate, 83% of our debt was unsecured and approximately 90% of our wholly owned properties were unencumbered. As we announced in last night's earnings release, Standard and Poor's recently reaffirmed our BBB flat credit rating, while also upgrading our outlook from stable to positive. We've been glad to see the rating agencies acknowledge the strength of our balance sheet over the past year, reflecting our steady progress. In addition, earlier this week, we closed a repricing amendment for our $725 million term loan that was originally scheduled to mature in June 2029. The amended term loan has a final maturity date in April 2030 and now bears interest based on the five-year pricing grid, which results in amended pricing of SOFR plus 85 basis points. Based on the new pricing grid, this amendment lowers our borrowing cost by 40 basis points compared to the original term loan and further optimizes our debt maturity ladder. Turning now to our first quarter financial results. We delivered core FFO of $0.48 per share, representing a solid 3.5% increase year-over-year. Similarly, AFFO grew 4% year-over-year to $0.42 per share. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to navigate the macroeconomic landscape supported by our well qualified and resilient customer base. We believe our business is both defensive and growth oriented, which should benefit shareholders in times of uncertainty, thanks to the effective execution of our strategy, strong customer retention and diligent expense management. That being the case, we are pleased to reaffirm our full year 2025 guidance provided in late February. In closing, our business remains strong, supported by our solid balance sheet, stable operating performance and thoughtful growth initiatives. Our well-structured capital position continues to provide the flexibility to pursue appropriate investment opportunities while maintaining our commitment to disciplined growth and steady value creation for our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to begin the question-and-answer session.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith of UBS. Your line is open.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Seems like the renewal rate was in the first quarter was 5.2% and in April it dipped to 4.5%. So just trying to understand what are the dynamics that would drive the renewal rate down sequentially and if there's any other factors that we're just weighing on that? Thanks.
Charles Young: Yes. Thanks for your question. This is Charles. We signaled this last quarter. This is kind of the typical kind of flow of renewals throughout the year. They're going to peak in Q1, which you saw really strong. There's usually and typically a little bit of moderation into the summer and we're starting to see that a little bit as we go into Q2. It's not going to move much from here and month-by-month it's going to go up and down and we expect at the end of the year it's going to come back up. So this is exactly unfolding exactly as we expected. And as you look at it combined with the new lease rate, blends have been going up every month since December. So this is in line with what we thought. As you go into the summer, you get a little higher turnover and that's kind of natural of what you see on the renewal process.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe of Citibank. Your line is open.
Eric Wolfe: Thanks. The home builder commentary has been somewhat subdued thus far. So I was just wondering, if you could talk maybe about the new home builders that are approaching you now given some of the weakness from the retail buyer, how much you could scale up the partnerships? And then secondly, to what extent some of this weaker homebuilder commentary gets you worried about some of the shadow supply impact that maybe you saw last year? Thanks.
Scott Eisen: Thanks, Eric. Hey, it's Scott Eisen. Look, our dialogue with the homebuilders continues to be strong. We've obviously really built out our relationships with them over the last two years. We continue to engage daily, weekly with the national and regional homebuilders. I'd say that in terms of our forward flow for the CFO, we continue to sift through lots of opportunities and we selectively choose the forward purchase communities that make sense for us in our buy box locations and demographics. And so that flow continues and I think we're pleased with what we see from the builders. I think there's probably been a little bit of an increase in the dialogue we've had with them on the end of month tapes. And I think, opportunistically, we're seeing some ability to buy some homes, two, three, five homes at a time at the end of month, and we're seeing some ability to execute there. But I'd say, generally speaking, the dialogue is strong and continues to be strong.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Steve Sakwa: Yes. Maybe just following up on that question. How are you thinking about kind of your yield hurdles, just kind of with more volatility, bond market pricing? I guess, is a 6% yield still adequate in today's environment? And do you have any ability to sort of push that up?
Dallas Tanner: Steve, Dallas. As Scott mentioned, look, he used the word shifting. We're getting to see more deal flow. There's no doubt about that right now than maybe where we were a year ago. All things being equal in terms of how we're underwriting yield on cost and what is our cost of capital to be able to lean in there, I would say it's sort of the following. We've been pretty active as you know disposing and calling assets that are sort of in the low 4s on a run rate cap rate basis, reinvesting at a 6. I think Scott and I hope that sort of forward opportunities may get a little bit better. We're certainly seeing more volume, which typically would lead to a conversation around seeing better pricing. We can't obviously speak for each builder or what they're dealing with. I think for John and I, as we sit around and think about our sources and uses and how we want to grow both on balance sheet and in our joint venture partnerships, we're trying to be as deliberate as we can around what is the highest and best use of our cost of capital at any given point. And so we've got somewhere around call it $1.5 billion of dry powder between our revolver and cash, we can dispose of more assets. We'd love to see the spreads get wider to your point. But I think development and development costs aren't necessarily coming in, right. So it's more around finding stuff where a seller or a partner is willing to build at a margin that's just a bit more accretive than it was maybe a year or two below. And then look, it's your point on the bond markets and John can speak more on this later, it's been hard to sort of think about in the spot where long-term debt is or as we think about how to sort of think about that as another source of capital over time. But right now, we're going to use as much of our disposition proceeds in cash and just keep kind of evolving out of older homes into newer product, both at the community level and also scattered.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jana Galan of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Jana Galan: Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations on the bad debt achieving a new post pandemic low. I was curious, do you think you have further opportunity to bring it down or is it better to be more cautious now in this macro environment?
Charles Young: I appreciate the question. Yes, we're proud of the work that the teams have done to bring bad debt in. It's been a good effort. It's also a reflection of the quality of our residents. We're off to a good start. We'll see how the summer goes. There's a macro backdrop that's out there. But right now, teams are executing as we look across the markets. It's really kind of improvement across the board. Some of our historically low bad debt markets are getting back to their levels that we expected. The markets that we're keeping an eye on are Atlanta, Chicago, Southern California, a little bit of Carolinas, all improving. But as we look at the court times and kind of that process, that's something we keep an eye on. So we're cautiously optimistic that we're going in the right direction here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks, and good morning, everybody. Appreciate all the detail on April leasing trends, but I'm just curious, if I recall correctly around mid-May of last year, maybe into June, you had started to see some softening in trends. So I'm just wondering when you look at your dashboards, the leading indicators, if there's anything that suggests the momentum you've seen year-to-date could be moderating into the peak leasing season or if the runway looks clear as far out as you're able to see? Thanks.
Charles Young: Yes. Look, the year is unfolding as we expected. Demand is still healthy. We're looking at all of our dials as you talked about, new visitors to the website from Q4 to Q1 are up. Demand is still here. You see we're absorbing well. We're holding occupancy while getting new lease rate growth every month. The way this typically unfolds is that there'll be some continued acceleration as we look at the new lease side into the summer. We typically peak out somewhere around June-ish plus/minus could go July, August, it varies each year. But the most important thing is renewals are steady. Talked about it earlier, they're strong. You get a little bit of like we just talked about moderation in the summer, but they're going to stay where they are, if not slightly higher and then accelerate at the end of the year. So you put that all together, we're seeing exactly what we want. Look, occupancy has held strong in Q1. That's going to come down a little bit. You get into move out season and we're trying to make sure that we're optimizing and capturing market rate on rents. So we like the setup coming off of Q1 and we think we're here to capture all that we can going into the peak leasing season.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, guys. Good morning. So, I understand the importance of the renewal rates you were just talking about. Wanna talk about turnover here for a moment. Turnover continues to come in, really, really low. Matter of fact, lower than last year, which was a really low year. So maybe you could talk a bit about what you sense is the drivers of this, increasingly lower turnover, and then maybe some color around what's embedded in your guide for turnover this year. And if this low lower trend of turnover continues, could this be a source of upside to the FFO guide? Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Haendel, for the question. This is Dallas, and I'll ask Charles to add a little color here to my comments. But I think you got to take a step back. And I think as you think about the business, the industry, our company, what the SFR resident has sort of proved out over the last decade is that they're by nature a lot stickier than maybe what we see in some of the other subsectors, excluding MH. And so, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, through both sort of famine and feast, the customer has sort of been extremely sticky and has continued to show a propensity to renew. That being said, Charles signaled this in the fall of last year. We've seen renewal rates as high as 80%, which we would not expect. I want to emphasize that point that Charles just made in the previous question. We know that has to come in. Traditionally, pre-pandemic, we're sort of in the low to mid-70s in terms of how often we renew. And then through the pandemic, it's sort of creeped up into the 70s and the high 70s. I would just also add there's this mortgage dynamic that's going on right now that's really interesting. And if you just think about the setup with both how the company is performing, what the customer is likely feeling and seeing in the marketplace, our move out to homeownership buying is as low as it's ever been on our surveys, and that continues to sort of lend itself to this thesis that the customer is going to stay longer and longer. What's been equally sort of supportive in both our backdrop and the setup as we go into summer, as Charles mentioned, is that this new lease acceleration is doing what we thought it would do going into summer. And so while we would expect to have less renewal, we certainly are renewing more earlier in the year than we underwrote originally to your point, Haendel, and we got to see how that plays out through summer. I don't want to set Charles up to be the good guy or the bad guy in terms of what every customer does with their decision making through summer. But we've seen, and Charles just alluded to it, we can see out 69 days and it feels pretty good. So maybe I hand that to Charles to add a bit more perspective, but just the backdrop and the setup is really favorable right now.
Charles Young: Yes. Look, I think it's a combination of resident enjoying our product. They're staying longer. We're up to 38.5 months. We're providing value add services that make it easy for them to stay with us. And then you have the macro backdrop as Dallas talked about. It does vary market-by-market, but overall, it's a good start, Haendel, in Q1. Turnover is slightly lower than we expected. That's why you're seeing some of the strong occupancy. But we're going into the kind of move out season, if you will, and there'll be some step up in that turnover. So we're going to keep an eye on it. I'll let John speak to where we are on our guide. But right now, we feel like we're on track on turnover, maybe a little bit ahead of it, but we got some months left here to see how it plays out.
Jonathan Olsen: Yes. Haendel, it's John. It's a good question. As Charles noted, we're maybe slightly ahead of where we expected to be in terms of turnover. But I would remind everyone that turnover combined with days to re-resident is really the driving force in terms of how those statistics flow through to occupancy. I think when we laid out our guidance, we sort of articulated our expectation that days to re-resident would be marginally higher this year than in the last few. And that's primarily driven by longer days on market as we go out and try to optimize and capture the market rate that's available. So I think it's too early in the year to really be able to say whether there is upside relative to the guide based on what we're seeing vis-a-vis turnover. But as Dallas and Charles both said, we're really pleased with the first quarter results. Our customer is sticky. The business is quite stable and we're looking forward to getting into the mid to peak season and seeing where we go from here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Tricarico of Scotiabank. Your line is open. Daniel, perhaps your line is on mute. Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jamie Feldman: Hello. This is Cooper Clark on for Jamie. Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about the strong OpEx performance in 1Q and how much, if any, of the lower growth was timing related? And also, what numbers might have come in lower versus what you assumed in guidance outside of the positive update on your insurance renewal?
Charles Young: Hey, Cooper, this is Charles. Yeah, I think I mentioned on the call the reduction in R&M quarter-over-quarter is really what drove the good performance on OpEx. This year that cost to maintain overall we've been tracking in the right direction, but quarter-over-quarter can really vary based on weather when it comes to R&M and we saw much more mild kind of early part of the year here than we did last year and that's the big driver. Overall, though, we are controlling what we can control. Our teams are executing well. We have just such a great platform when it comes to our scale and density procurement, all that we do. And that just shows up in how we do things. I would also say the execution on turns has been strong in addition to R&M. We're turning well in terms of time. And as you think about the turnover, we just talked a little bit about that being lower. That's another driver of why the R&M number is slightly lower.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski of Green Street. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Thanks for the time. John, can you provide some color around the large increase year-over-year on share-based comp? I think it was up about 30%. And is this $40 million kind of plus or minus annual rate reasonable assumption moving forward?
Jonathan Olsen: Yes. Thanks for the question, John. I think we made some changes to the way our share-based comp program works. We used to have sort of periodic performance-based plans that would run for a period of years and then get replaced. As we've laid out in the proxy, we've moved away from that approach. And so now we're going to have more performance-based grants annually rather than the lumpy, every few year, OPP plan or outperformance plan. Happy to go into more detail on that offline, but that's what's driving the difference.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Adam Kramer: Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. Just wanted to ask about the kind of state of built to rent competition here. I know you guys have talked about it in the past. I think you guys are pretty early on to kind of talk about the competitive pressure there for new BTR deliveries. Where are we today in that process? I think you guys have talked about deliveries that were down that would be down pretty significantly year-over-year in '25. So is that kind of still the base case here? And what are you seeing with regards to second half of the year 2025 deliveries, maybe even into 2026 deliveries, just generally kind of the state of BTR composition?
Charles Young: Yes, this is Charles. Look, we signaled this last year that we saw some supply coming in middle of the year in Phoenix, Texas and Central Florida. The good news is those deliveries are down and we're working through it. We're absorbing well. You can see it in our results. Those markets specifically, while behind some of the Western markets and the Midwest as I talked about in my prepared remarks, they're turning positive on the new lease side and occupancy is holding steady if not increasing. So, we're working through it. Can't tell you exactly how long it's going to take. We're keeping an eye on it. But the good news is by as we're looking forward, we're not seeing a lot of deliveries -- new deliveries come on, it's down substantially, but we need to absorb in those markets. The other markets, we can have more of a balance of supply and demand, maybe a slight uptick in terms of overall given kind of what's going on with mortgage rates. But the reality is they're acting as we would expect when you think about Atlanta and Carolina, Chicago, the California market, Seattle, Denver, in line with kind of a balanced supply and demand. Demand is still here for our product as you can see from our turnover in all of our metrics. So, we expect that we're going to work through it in these markets. We'll keep an eye on it and keep you guys updated.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern of RBC. Your line is open.
Brad Heffern: Yes. Thanks, everybody. On third party management, you obviously got a lot over the finish line, right, when the program was launched, but it's been kind of quiet since mid-last year. So is there anything to read into that? And what would you attribute the lull to? And are you continuing to have lots of conversations around the offering?
Dallas Tanner: Great question. This is Dallas. First, as we laid out last year, as we started to announce the program, we said that we were going to be really specific about who, when, what, which portfolios. It has to make sense. We don't want to create noise in our own business. We want to try to do things that are both accretive internally and how we can operate a more efficient business and also look for the right sort of portfolio overlap, etc. They got to be strategic partners. And we're having a number of conversations, we always do. And we haven't seen anything yet that's truly fit in that strategic bucket. I would say that, like I said last summer, we're fine if this stays at 3 clients candidly. We'd also would be fine if it were 10 clients if we were the right portfolio. So our goal is just to do things that make our business better, that create strategic value add for the company. But I think that this will be a continued industry that will evolve and I think our opportunity set will get wider over time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Blouin of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Julien Blouin: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Could you sort of help us understand how we should think about the defensiveness of the SFR sector if the macro were to deteriorate? I mean, it tends to be relatively more resilient, when we look at sort of recent instances. But does maybe even the larger portability gap versus homeownership make it that much more resilient than in the past, sort of becoming a trade down option for some homeowner families that fall on hard times?
Dallas Tanner: It's a great question. I think you sort of led with the answer, which is when you think about the customer base of who we have, it's a number of healthcare professionals, teachers, people that work across a variety of subsectors and industries. They're looking for three basic things that we see over and over in our data. They want space. They want access to a yard for their kids, for their pets, for their animals. They want proximity to good transportation corridors that make their commute times reasonable. And then they ultimately want access to great schools and could be in a school district or proximity to school districts they might otherwise not be able to afford. That as the backdrop generally regardless of the cycle would tend to continue to promote this concept or idea that if I can have that quality of life -- that quality of a leasing lifestyle at a fraction of the cost of ownership, there is a value opportunity there for our customers. Now, if the market starts to shift to double click on your question, you look at us relative to multifamily or some of the other sectors, on a rent per square foot basis, we're far more affordable. And on a quality of sort of space and the cost to move or if they need to have somebody live with them, i.e., maybe a parent who's aging out, those are all additional value adds to the leasing lifestyle. And so we've talked about this in the past. Our bucket of customers sort of fit into three buckets. One is out of need. One is because they have a transitional event happening on their life, and the third is they're preferential, and they want the leasing lifestyle versus maybe an ownership lifestyle. So look, I do think we're defensive. To John's prepared remarks earlier in the call, I think the value proposition of Invitation Homes is that while there can be uncertainty in the market, it can definitely act as a defensive opportunity. But more or less, we're still going to see pretty significant opportunities for growth. And look, we sit in a really favorable backdrop, both on the revenue and the defensive side, but also on the expense side. We haven't talked about this, but we had fundamental headwinds with property tax and number of these things as we had rapid homeowners -- excuse me, home price appreciation, and those are going to be continued tailwinds for us on the expense side as well. So all things being equal, we can't see perfectly in the future, but we've now had two or three sort of cycles that we've lived through where there's been economic uncertainty and the company has been resilient through kind of each of those cycles in its own way.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Hightower of Barclays. Your line is open.
Richard Hightower: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question here. I guess to continue a little bit of that same line of questioning, obviously, I guess, the for-sale market for housing in this country is pretty much broken for a lot of reasons, I think, that have probably been articulated on these calls. But do you guys have, it's kind of a wonky question, do you have a sense of pent-up demand for people who really would prefer to own? They just can't afford the monthly payment because of mortgage rates. But, if that math ever changes, what's the risk to Invitation current demand set, if you've ever thought about it that way?
Dallas Tanner: Good question. We think about that way all the time. And don't forget, we built this business in an incredibly low mortgage rate environment, 2%, 3%, 4% mortgages. And we had 96% to 97% occupancy through all those sorts of chapters. So even in a low cost of ownership environment, it doesn't change the fact that there's 47 million households at least in the U.S. So that's sort of always a plus on our business. I think to your point around if mortgage rates were to go through the floor and that spurs homeownership activity, we view that as a positive. Our businesses typically run between about, call it, 18% and 27% of our customers moving out and clicking the box saying I'm moving out because I'm going to purchase a home. We view our company as a normal part of that housing continuum. So we're okay there. I think the retention and the renewals that Charles talked about earlier are probably more indicative of it being a little higher and elevated right now, which is net-net a positive, but it's just a near-term positive. It's not anything that we would view as sort of ordinary course to be an 80% renewal business. I think if homeownership picks up, as I mentioned before, hugely positive for a couple of reasons for our business. One, it's a healthier market overall. We prefer that candidly where there's enough supply in the market and enough transaction volume where you get a better sense of values. Two, if home price appreciation starts to pick up, that is actually a proxy for where rents typically go. And so in our business, as the values of our assets increase, typically you'll see that the rents are increasing as well. And then SFR supply obviously sort of is indicative of what happens there. So today you're seeing more resale supply tick up in the marketplaces, more options for people, which we view as a good thing. And I think the calculus is that right now people are wanting to sort of stamp hat, hunker down and bet on predictability versus anything.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jesse Lederman of Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Jesse Lederman: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a little bit on property management expense. Looks like it's been a little bit higher the last couple of quarters and on an apples-to-apples basis from 1Q 2024, it's up about 80 basis points. Apples-to-apples meaning you also had 3PM at that point as well. So can you maybe talk about what's driving the increase if it's the wholly owned portfolio or the third-party property management portfolio and any moving pieces there? Thanks.
Jonathan Olsen: Hey, Jesse, it's John. That's a good question. I would remind you that we phased on, we onboarded our third-party management clients over the course of last year. And so if you're comparing first quarter 2025 to first quarter 2024, first quarter 2024 was not reflective of the headcount additions, some of the technology investments we made in order to put ourselves in a position to service these new third-party management customers. So that's really what the primary increase is related to.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. Question on tariffs. Curious what you think may happen during the peak leasing season, the summer season with HVACs and should we anticipate any increase in costs as a result of presumably higher replacement costs and what have you -- given that proposed tariffs at this point?
Charles Young: Yes, look, this is Charles. We're monitoring the situation closely. It's too early to tell kind of where and if it's going to flow through and so you're asking the right question. There's a pause, we'll see where it all comes out. The reality is, we're in a really great position given our scale, size, our procurement, our national programmatic partnerships that we have. We have dual partnerships when you talked about HVAC and appliances, so we've kind of back up between a couple of options. This gives us some of the best pricing in the industry. That being said, we're going to have to watch how it flows through. HVAC and appliances are probably the area on the R&M side we'd pay attention to. But you also need to talk about this is a small part of our overall kind of book. We're turning homes, labor is a bigger part of our cost structure, if you will. So while there could be some impact, I think we're going to be mitigated by our scale and size and our programs and our partnerships. But ultimately, we're going to see how it flows through. And we're not building ground up homes here, so we're not taking a bunch of materials. It becomes a smaller part of who we are and how we operate. But we're going to keep an eye on it. It's a kind of fluid situation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Tricarico of Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Daniel Tricarico: Great. Thanks. You can hear me. Right?
Jonathan Olsen: Yep.
Daniel Tricarico: Dallas, last call you talked about finding ways to complement the course of our business and to possibly enter new markets. It's only been two months, but curious if you have an update on the work being done on any of those initiatives.
Dallas Tanner: Yes, I think we mentioned, I mean, we're now operating in San Antonio, parts broader parts of Nashville. We've talked about some of the other markets that we'd love to get in over time. We're certainly looking. But we're trying to -- ultimately, it's not just about how many markets we can be in. Obviously, when we take a step back and we talk with our board about strategy and what the company should look like 5 or 10 or 15 years from now, we want to have a great risk adjusted basis where we've got conviction on the growth and the profile and the demographic of those markets. But I think we'll continue to try to scale up in the markets we're in too. I think nobody should lose sight of that. We'd love to get all of our markets to sizes like Phoenix and Atlanta and Miami where we have real scale and we continue to drive greater cost efficiencies both with our service platform and how Charles and the team drive down costs and also on the revenue front. And ultimately, it allows Scott and his team to underwrite better on new product and new construction and the conviction we have around rents and what they're doing. So I expect us to continually add markets over the coming years, but look for us to sort of double down and double click on these Sunbelt and Southeast markets where we know that they're going to have a propensity for better growth for longer.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Linda Tsai: Yes. Hi. I think last quarter you said you expected FY 2025 occupancy to end at 96.5%. Just wondering if that's your current expectation still?
Charles Young: Yes, good question. Probably in light of the high occupancy we showed in Q1, that's typical of how the book kind of operates throughout a year. We're going into move out season. This is the heavier kind of lease expiration part of the year and you'll see turnover start to tick up slightly and occupancy come down. And as John mentioned earlier in the call, we're trying to capture as much of the market rate that's out there. So we may be staying on the market a little longer. Our budget has us going up on days to be resident year-over-year because we're expecting that there is a little bit more supply than there have been during the COVID periods. And we talked about specifically in a few of our markets, we're absorbing some of the supply that's there. Again, we're absorbing well, but that's in our underwriting that we're going to see it come down. We'll see how it plays out through the rest of the year, but you'll see it come down. From here Q2, Q3 and then towards the end of the year, typically it starts to come back up. But each year has its own cycle, so we'll see how it plays.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani of KBW. Your line is open.
Jason Sabshon: This is actually Jason Sabshon on for Jade. Have you seen, an increase in any move outs due to lower mortgage rates and homebuilder incentives? Thanks.
Charles Young: No, this is Charles. We really haven't. Our reason to move out for purchase is as low as we've really seen. It's in the mid-teens. And look, we know the homebuilders are buying down rate and I think they've been performing well based on that. But in our book, we're not seeing a lot of move out for purchase at this point, but we're going to keep an eye on it.
Operator: This completes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks everybody for joining us today. And a final word of thanks to all of our associates. What a great quarter. We look forward to seeing many of you next month at Nareit. Thanks. Take care.
Operator: [Operator Closing Remarks].

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-27 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Scott McLaughlin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Scott McLaughlin: Greetings, and welcome. I'm here today from Invitation Homes with Dallas Tanner, Chief Executive Officer, Charles Young, President and Chief Operating Officer, John Olson, Chief Financial Officer, and Scott Eisen, Chief Investment Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question and answer session with our covering sell-side analysts. During today's call, we may reference our fourth quarter 2024 earnings release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed and is available on the investor relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Except to the extent otherwise required by law, Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, in yesterday's earnings release. With that, I now turn the call over to Dallas Tanner, our Chief Executive Officer.
Dallas Tanner: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Invitation Homes delivered another strong quarter of operational and financial results to close out 2024. Our full-year results demonstrated solid execution across our platform, including core FFO per share growth of 6.4% and AFFO per share growth of 6.7%. I extend my thanks to our dedicated teams and for the continued loyalty of our residents. On the latter point, we're proud that our residents continue to choose Invitation Homes for the long term. During the fourth quarter, the average length of stay was approximately 38 months. We also achieved a renewal rate of 80% with same-store rental rate growth on renewals of 4.2% year over year. We believe this underscores the value proposition that our industry and our platform offer and the strong relationships we're able to maintain with our residents over time. It's also a testament to the continued demand for our high-quality homes in desirable neighborhoods located in some of the fastest-growing areas of the country and delivered with our trademark genuine care. During 2024, we emerged as the professional manager of choice for partners seeking premium service and performance. We grew our JV and third-party managed home count by more than six and a half times last year to over 25,000 homes. We expect this business to continue to have opportunities to grow in the future. At the same time, we further optimized our wholly-owned portfolio, recycling capital from older assets into newly constructed, growth-enhancing investments. This was possible in part through our innovative builder partnerships, helping us welcome over 1,800 individuals and families into newly built homes during 2024. In the meantime, our pipeline remains robust, with more than 2,000 homes under development by our home builder partners at the start of this year. Since we launched our home builder partnerships nearly four years ago, we have continued to broaden and refine the traditional build-to-rent model. In doing so, we've moved beyond the binary view of either on-balance sheet development or completed home purchases. Rather, our unique broad-spectrum approach considers everything from early-stage builder partnerships to the acquisition of stabilized communities. As the market has further evolved and our approach has become more sophisticated, we're continuing to evaluate new opportunities and structures to strengthen our growth profile by thinking out of the traditional SFR box. Combined, our strategic growth initiatives allow us to enhance our scale and density within our core markets and potentially expand our existing footprint by evaluating new markets with attractive growth profiles. As we've learned, improved scale and density support better OpEx and CapEx management across the entire portfolio, setting the stage for overall margin expansion. In that regard, our same-store NOI margin returned to over 68% last year, and we believe we can continue to see improvement as we further execute on our growth and efficiency objectives. Turning now to current market conditions. Last summer, we were among the first to call out the moderating impact that new home deliveries were having in some of our markets. We continue to work through this and are seeing some early signs of improvement. At the same time, we are taking a measured approach with our initial expectations for 2025 and remaining vigilant as we seek better clarity throughout the year, including with regard to new supply for the year ahead, the impact of potential tariffs, and the chance for prolonged higher mortgage rates, and the effect that builder spec inventory and buyer incentives may have on the market. Nevertheless, we believe the tailwinds for our business remain supported by the demographics. As a reminder, there are 46 million American households who lease their primary residence, and among those, nearly one in three choose to lease a single-family home. With our average resident age of 38 years old, this includes many millennials and young families who desire the flexibility and convenience of leasing a single-family home. It also includes those who appreciate the compelling value of leasing, with the average cost of leasing a single-family home nearly $1,100 a month cheaper than owning in our markets according to John Byrne's research. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. With our dedicated teams, strategic approach to external growth, and operational excellence, we believe we are well-positioned to create value for our stakeholders while delivering on our mission to provide high-quality homes and superior service to our residents. Charles, over to you.
Charles Young: Thank you, Dallas. I'm proud to begin by highlighting our team's outstanding response to the recent wildfires in Los Angeles. Our local team showcased the very best of Invitation Homes, demonstrating extraordinary dedication in caring for our residents. We lost only two homes to the fires, which was thanks in part to the scattered nature of our portfolio that provides a built-in risk mitigate. Yet the more important victory was ensuring all of our residents and associates remain safe. And I extend my deepest gratitude to our LA-based team, first responders, and all those who worked tirelessly during this challenging time. Moving on now to same-store results. I'm happy to report strong fourth-quarter performance with NOI growth of 4.7% year over year. This result was driven by core revenue growth of 2.7% and a 1.5% reduction in core operating expenses, demonstrating our continued focus on operational efficiency. For the full year 2024, we delivered NOI growth of 4.6%, based on core revenue growth of 4.3% and core operating expense growth of 3.7%. Notably, our property tax expense growth of 5.8% year over year was in line with our latest expectations and brought a welcome return to a more normal growth rate following two years of larger increases. Overall, our results underscore our differentiated performance within the residential REIT sector that we believe our resident-focused approach helps to provide. During 2024, that included annual turnover of just 22.6%, average length of stay of approximately 38 months, same-store average occupancy above 97%, and a full-year blended rent growth of 3.9%. Turning now to our leasing performance. For the fourth quarter, we achieved same-store blended rent growth of 2.3% year over year, based on a 4.2% renewal rate growth and a negative 2.2% new lease rate growth. As Dallas mentioned earlier, we've seen a healthy improvement in same-store leasing as we moved into 2025 and more recently kicked off our spring leasing. As we would expect this time of year, new lease rent growth has reaccelerated and was positive here in February. While renewal rent growth has remained strong in the mid-fives for the past couple of quarters to date, including January and preliminary February results, average occupancy rose to 97% and blended lease rate growth climbed to 3.5%. While John will discuss more details of our 2025 guidance with you in a moment, I'd like to share some color around our leasing expectations for the year. We anticipate our same-store new lease rate growth will continue to accelerate through April or May with renewals and average occupancy moderating somewhat as we enter the summer months before improving again towards the last few months of the year. Overall, we expect full-year same-store blended rent growth in the mid-threes and average occupancy of 96.5% at the midpoint, effectively finalizing our return to more normal pre-pandemic levels. Before I close, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate Tim Loadner on his promotion to Chief Operating Officer. Tim joined Invitation Homes shortly after it was founded in 2012, most recently serving as Executive Vice President and Head of Field Operations. Many of you have met Tim at recent investor conferences and know he's a seasoned leader with unmatched talent for customer care, operations management, and efficiency. Following Tim's promotion to COO next week, I'll remain in my role as President, allowing me to focus even more on our strategic plans for growth. Together with Tim and the entire leadership team, we're excited for the year ahead, with great appreciation for our outstanding associates in the field who remain focused on leasing execution, disciplined cost management, and providing the exceptional service that our residents expect. This is truly fundamental to our success and the achievement of our goals. Thank you for bringing your best every day. With that, I'll turn it over to John to discuss our financial results in more detail.
John Olson: Thanks, Charles. Today, I'll cover the following three topics. First, an update on our balance sheet and liquidity. Second, our fourth quarter and full-year 2024 financial results. And third, the introduction of our 2025 guidance and assumptions. I'll start with our balance sheet. At year-end 2024, we had a robust liquidity position of nearly $1.4 billion comprised of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet and undrawn revolver capacity. Our year-end net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.3 times, just below our targeted range of 5.5 to 6 times. Over the last several years, we've made substantial progress in optimizing our debt structure. Today, over 83% of our total debt is unsecured, nearly 90% of our wholly-owned homes are unencumbered, and over 91% of our total debt is either fixed rate or swapped to fixed rate. I'm also pleased to note enhanced transparency regarding our swap book through a new addition to our supplemental, which is posted to the Investor Relations section of our website. Our new Schedule 2D provides detail around our active swaps as of year-end as well as forward-starting swaps through 2026, along with our swaps' weighted average strike rates. We believe our swap book positions us well for the foreseeable future, with the vast majority of our floating rate debt locked in at attractive fixed rates for the next several years. Next, I'll cover our fourth-quarter results. Total revenues grew 5.6% to $659 million in the fourth quarter, and property operating expenses were well-controlled, a testament to our team's cost controls. This translated into strong year-over-year growth in our fourth-quarter results, with core FFO per share up 5.9% and AFFO per share up 8.9%. For the full year 2024, we delivered 6.4% core FFO growth per share and 6.7% AFFO growth per share. Looking ahead now to 2025, we've introduced our full-year guidance ranges, with core FFO in a range of $1.88 to $1.94 per share, AFFO between $1.58 and $1.64 per share, and same-store NOI growth in a range of 1% to 3%. Our guidance also anticipates $600 million in wholly-owned acquisitions at the midpoint, primarily funded through dispositions of $500 million at the midpoint. The complete details of our 2025 guidance and core FFO bridge from 2024 to our 2025 guidance midpoint are available in last night's release. In summary, we entered 2025 in a very healthy financial position, with a strong balance sheet, compelling operating metrics, and a clear strategic vision focused on growth. Our strong liquidity position and largely unencumbered asset base provide us with tremendous flexibility to pursue compelling growth opportunities while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation. More than ever, we're focused on providing genuine care to our residents and delivering superior value for our shareholders. Operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions.
Operator: We will now begin our question and answer session. To ask a question, please press star, then one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. In the interest of time, we ask the participants to limit themselves to one question and then requeue by pressing star one to ask a follow-up question. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. The first question comes from Eric Wolf with Citibank. Please go ahead.
Eric Wolf: Hey. Thanks. I think you said that your blended spreads were already in the mid-threes in February. So I was just curious why you're not expecting that to accelerate a bit further since I think your guidance is based on a similar level throughout the year. I think Dallas also mentioned that you're taking sort of a cautious approach to guidance, so I don't know if that's sort of what you meant by that or is referring to something else. Thanks.
Charles Young: Yep. Thanks, Eric. We are anticipating blended rent growth for 2025 in the mid-threes. So, as you recall, the typical seasonal curve is we see acceleration in new lease rate growth here in the first part of the year, as turnover picks up in the summer months, we see a little bit of a step back. And then, you know, sort of in the back part of the year, some moderation, potentially some reacceleration. We do feel good that, you know, we've seen acceleration each month since December. And I think, you know, overall, we're just trying to take a very measured approach to 2025. The reality is, you know, there are some supply pressures. There is some supply out there that needs to be absorbed. We anticipate that the absorption of that supply will have a flow-through impact on occupancy. So as you saw, the midpoint of our range is 96.5%. That assumes that turnover for 2025 is generally similar to 2024, maybe a skosh higher, but that the biggest impact comes from slightly longer days on market as we go out and try to achieve the best rate growth we can.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Dallas, in your opening remarks, you talked about how new home deliveries were impacting last year, but you're starting to see some early signs of improvement. So can you walk us through what you're seeing right now and then also what you're expecting from the new home deliveries through 2025? Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Yeah. Hey. Great question. You know, to double-click on something that John said, we're certainly seeing some reacceleration as we head into the spring leasing season. We've seen, you know, supply start to moderate coming off sort of peaks last summer as we called out when we started to see some of these real supply pressures coming into the market. Now there is some variability amongst markets, you know, we'd expect that there's still some pressures in Florida and Phoenix and some of those markets that had sort of easier barriers to entry, in terms of new development with a lot of the starts in 2020 and 2021 sort of feeding into the system. We're optimistic as we pay attention to both deliveries and starts that this number probably, most likely, continues to get better for us. You know, we've even listened to some of our counterparts, with the public homebuilders, and some of their calls, as well as our discussion with regionals that we would just expect that there may be a bit more of spec inventory as mortgage rates stay elevated. And all this is, you know, slight headwinds for new lease, but it's terrific for our renewals business. So we'll continue to anchor on the renewal side of the house, which has been close to 80% of our leasing volume for last year and be as aggressive as we can on rates on the new lease side. Sort of have to take what the market's giving us, but the skies are a little bit more clear now than they were, say, last summer.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Tricarico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Daniel Tricarico: Hey. Good morning. Fryder Stosser Scott. Wanted to ask about your coast markets. You know, first, have you seen any increase in activity in SoCal since the fires earlier in the year? And, you know, is there any incremental impact from that on your guidance that you can quantify? You know, and second, with the West Coast being your, you know, seeing stronger growth today, you know, there seems to be an increasing confidence in the demand recovery out there as well. You know, potentially better business backdrop too. So have you, you know, reevaluated being a net seller? Thanks.
Charles Young: So this is Charles. I'll take it. In terms of your initial question around the impact on guidance SoCal, really no material impact. If you look at our NorCal and SoCal markets, we run really high occupancy. The fires, very unfortunate. But for us, we only had two homes that were lost. You gotta remember, our book is a little further away from where the fires were located. And at the time, when we were running high 97% occupancy in SoCal, there were only 50 homes that were available on the market at the time. And so while, yeah, there was a little bit more demand, it didn't really have a huge impact on how we're running. That book generally runs at a high occupancy because there's a lack of supply in that market. And we're also doing really well on rate there, on both the new lease and the renewal side. So it's been really solid. If you want to discuss Dallas going into the dispositions.
Dallas Tanner: Look, it's a really great question on how to think about accretively recycling capital. Scott and I spend a lot of time looking at ways to create, you know, call it highest and best use cost of capital for the company. And we've certainly had a successful year in 2024 selling roughly, call it, 1,500 homes on balance sheet, for proceeds of around $600 million, and those are typically, you know, sort of priced around a forecast in today's market. And then Scott's done a nice job of, you know, accretively reinvesting that capital closer to a six. And so I think as you think about Southern California specifically to your question, there will likely always be opportunities for us to continue to refine that portfolio. It's really at our discretion based on a total return model as we look at the higher expected rents that Charles just talked about. And in a business that's pretty automatic in terms of our expectations around renewals and new lease. And weighing that out with where we see sort of appetite on a risk-adjusted basis. And so for us, we're a total return investor. Important to remember that we don't look at things in just a binary bubble all the time. Either on yield or on total value, but we're looking to accretively kind of grab both over time and distance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yana Gallon with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Yana Gallon: Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping if we could, Dallas, following up on that, talk a little bit more about the capital allocation and the transaction market. Know what you're seeing right now. Is it primarily portfolios or BTR communities? Or is there a little bit more of an opportunity in kind of like one-off MLS sales?
Dallas Tanner: I'll take it. This is Dallas. Let me take the first part of this and ask Scott to provide some color. From a high level, we're absolutely focused on bringing more and more new product into the portfolio through these builder partnerships and structures that we're seeing, you know, candidly evolve and get better and even create ways for us on a risk-adjusted basis to have less capital out the door early, but to lock ourselves into some really good opportunities over time. You'll see that even in the fourth quarter, we backed off of a few opportunities because we felt some market dynamic shifting, and that was at basically little to no risk to the company. We love the fact that we're kind of asset-light in this model, but driving towards called untrended sixes. I'll ask Scott to provide more color on what he's seeing on the ground right now between sort of stabilized transactions bulk and what really is a nothing market in terms of one-off acquisitions.
Scott Eisen: Yeah. And, obviously, in terms of where we are sourcing deal flow right now, as Dallas said, we're not really seeing very much on the single asset MLS market. We absolutely are evaluating bulk portfolios. We have obviously institutional sellers with whom we've engaged. Obviously, in terms of where we see that market, we've seen some opportunities on a small scale to buy small pieces of bulk portfolios, but we absolutely are seeing deal flow there. We've actually seen a very nice deal flow of kind of end-of-month or end-of-quarter tapes from the builders in terms of opportunities. I think we see some yield there that we like, albeit the hit rate is obviously very low on a percentage win basis. But in selective areas, in selective communities, we've seen opportunity. We're absolutely seeing deal flow in terms of stabilized BTR communities. We're being very selective in terms of locations and yields that we're targeting. But we're definitely seeing institutional sellers and financial sponsors to build product in the 2021 time frame that want to get liquidity. And then we continue to engage in strategic dialogue with our national builder partners in terms of targeting and executing forward purchase, you know, build projects. As Dallas said, we've got about 2,000 in the pipeline on a forward basis, and we'd like to add more. So we continue to look at all of these channels, and we're trying to, you know, pick the right channels where we think there's the best risk-adjusted return for us as a publicly traded company.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, you know, Dallas, at the outset, you talked about looking for new and innovative structures for growth. Entering possibly new markets. You know, you guys added Tim to the C-suite, I think Charles commented that he's gonna be focused on growth, Scott, obviously, focused on growth too. Can you just help us better understand, you know, the management changes exactly the different roles of everyone on the team now? And then also, you know, do you expect to see more changes ahead for the team?
Dallas Tanner: Oh, yeah. Happy to answer those questions. Thanks for asking. First of all, it's gonna be a luxury of riches for me to have Charles freed up to work on a few more strategic things and areas of the business that we see are gonna continue to grow for the company over time. Scott's doing a really nice job in building out sort of our new product pipelines and everything that centers around call it traditional SFR growth, Charles and I have our eye on a number of opportunities, including ones we're already doing, like 3PM and sort of our strategies around how to make the platform more efficient over time. That both Charles and I will get the opportunity to work on together. Secondly, you know, Tim's been in the weeds on the business for a long time on the cost side of our house. Really rehab, turn of maintenance for basically a decade. Last year, Charles made the decision in concert, you know, with me and the rest of management to give Tim a little bit more flexibility to get more involved on the property management and leasing side of the house. And it just makes more sense because so much of our business is sort of a sweet combination between being centralized and the boots-on-the-ground part of our organization that is high touch in the field. And that transition went really seamless, I would say, through most of last year. I think for Charles and I, the goal is how do we widen the breadth of the organization without having to reinvent the wheel. And you saw what we did last year in adding 20,000 plus new units to our 3PM business. We're excited about what that business is, not only because it adds itself to extra efficiencies for our partners, but it creates a better margin-enhancing profile for our own business. We see some opportunities there. We're looking at some things around AI and technology that we'd like to implement with a little bit more pace and scale and focus. And candidly, I think having Charles as a partner to work on some of these things with me will allow us to go quicker, create more innovation, and lend another set of, you know, senior strategic thinking around the things that we're working on. I have no plans of going anywhere, nor does Charles, and so the goal is to just keep our heads down and keep trying to find ways to create alpha for both our shareholders and better opportunities for our residents.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks. Just expanding, I guess, a little bit on the last question. I mean, I guess, how meaningful and growth-enhancing do you think some of these projects that you're pursuing and kind of, you know, adding outside the SFR box? And then separately, you hit on, I think, for the first time in your prepared remarks, about, you know, evaluating some new markets. And so just curious, you know, if you can share any additional detail about, you know, your ability to, you know, gain immediate scale if you were to enter a new market similar to, you know, what we saw you do at Nashville last year.
John Olson: Yeah. This is John. I'll start off by just framing up how substantial some of these opportunities have already been for us. So in 2024, our third-party management businesses contributed about nine cents per share to core FFO and AFFO. And for 2025, we anticipate that, you know, between our JVs and our third-party management business, that'll contribute an incremental two cents a share. So, you know, I think very clearly that the third-party management business has been a really solid contributor to, you know, capital-light earnings growth, enhanced scale, better efficiencies, which I think you'll continue to see in terms of, you know, the cost related to managing our book. So we think that that has been absolutely a needle mover, and we're eager to try to find new opportunities that will continue to move the needle. I'll jump in on the second part of your question. This is Dallas. And I don't want to put Scott on the hot seat on a quarterly call, but we're definitely doing work on how to expand our current markets. How to think about new markets. You've heard us talk about markets in the past that we love, that we aren't in today, like Salt Lake City. We've talked about San Antonio in the past, Nashville getting a little bit more scale, and we've done the latter too. I think we would like to find ways to both widen and extend our advantage of scale in the markets that we're currently in, I would say, generally, almost all of them. And then there's probably a market or two over the next, you know, year to five that we could see ourselves make a strategic investment. And we don't take it lightly if we go into a market because we want to offer the same services. And I think some of the things that we talked about a second ago around AI automation, we've already seen that in some of our new leasing business where implementing some of that in our renewals business today is allowing us to leverage our leadership team, an example, Charles, to be able to start to think about some different things, ways that we can grow our company over time. So all the benefits of technology and the move to, you know, digital automation, to John's point, being able to flex and extend the infrastructure of the platform are gonna allow Invitation Homes over a long run rate to create more efficient returns on our own capital and those of our partners.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess I'm curious how you're thinking about the sustainable long-term same-store revenue run rate for this business. Seems to me that we could be nearing a low point for new lease pricing this year, especially if supply pressures could be abating. If renewal pricing can stay stickier around 4% this year, could potentially be a trough year for same-store revenue in your blend. So don't think you're already thinking about this year's same-store revenue outlook in context of the longer-term core growth opportunity for the portfolio. Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: Great question, Haendel. And I'll emphasize something John said earlier on. Which is we are, you know, we're taking a measured approach as we go into the year. Just knowing that there are some supply, I would say, some soft kind of headwinds around supply that we flagged six months ago. But to your point, we're seeing good velocity. And we also know that it's probably unrealistic to stay in the 97% plus occupancy rate forever. So we have rational expectations that sort of comes in and moderates a bit. You see that in our guide as well. Think as you go back, Haendel, if you think about the business since we went public in 2017, you know, renewals have generally been outside of the COVID years. Pretty sticky around 4% to 5%. You think about it on a blend. You know, we've had an unbelievable run in terms of rate in this country, which is driven by a lot of different things as you know. And new lease is always gonna be sort of a story around supply and expectations around future deliveries. And how you optimize your lease expiration curve. We've done some really great work over the last six months on our lease expiration curve feel like we're in a pretty defendable position going into the year. This summer, so we'd expect it, but we gotta see what the market's willing to get. It's a different environment than it was pre-pandemic. It was a lot more predictable in terms of deliveries. And I do think as the deliveries come down and all the data that we follow and suggest that, you know, deliveries are gonna be somewhere between 50% and, say, 70% down this year versus last, that doesn't take into consideration starts. And while there's still a relatively low cost of capital and the environment, there certainly are developers and operators to the point that Scott made earlier that are bringing product to the market, that are fighting to get full and are creating some tougher operating environments particularly in the Sunbelt right now. But I would just take a step back as much as we're impressed with our, you know, rate of growth in the Midwest right now, we're still very long. Our fundamental beliefs around the Sunbelt in the southeast. The demographic information suggests that we're gonna see prolonged tenure of demand. We know that there's something like 12,000 to 13,000 people a day turning age 35. Our average customer today is right around 38 years old. All the profile of that customer has been pretty resilient over the last five to seven years. So there's nothing in our business today that suggests that we need to change course, rethink a strategy, or invest in different parts of the country. In fact, maybe the opposite. While things are a little bit soft, we may actually look to extend our lead scale density in some of these markets while pricing softens that we can be in a position to really capture a bull run as the supply side sort of works through itself.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Hightower with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Rich Hightower: Hey. Good morning, guys. Obviously, covered a lot of ground today, but maybe just to pick up on a point that you just made, Dallas, you know, in terms of the core renter demographic and maybe drawing a contrast between multifamily and single-family. I think, you know, there's kind of this emerging thesis that the core multifamily comfort is expanding, you know, for all sorts of socioeconomic reasons. And so, you know, one, do you agree with that thesis? And second, do you think that it makes it, you know, a little more of a zero-sum proposition between multi and single than maybe we, you know, had earlier appreciated. Do you think it's, you know, the pie is big enough for everybody kinda to enjoy it, you know, for the next several years? In that sense.
Charles Young: Yeah. This is Charles. Thanks for the question. If I'm understanding the question, look, we think we're serving a unique part of the market that, you know, we have this opportunity. It's $1,000 more affordable to rent a home than it is to buy in today's market. You know, we are three, four, five bedrooms, so we're serving families. The majority of our families, 60%, have kids, have pets, and, you know, our portfolio, whether it's our scattered portfolio or build-to-rent, is around safe neighborhoods and good school districts. And so we have an opportunity to continue to serve that group, that demographic. We're seeing really good demand there. People are staying for 38 months and rising each quarter. You know, the demand is healthy. We talked a little bit about the book, but, you know, we built back occupancy in Q4 and looking at where we are in January, February, we're seeing good absorption and good demand. And I think it really comes down to that, you know, we have some markets that are working through absorption, but our turnover is low, our renewal is high, and I think that's the differentiation of our product relative to multifamily, and we like where we are, and we're serving an ecosystem that's part of the business. And when you really look at it and compare it to multifamily, on a price per square foot, given that you're getting more space, bigger houses, you know, in and around school districts and job growth, and demographics, with the yard that the family goes in, there really is value that we are offering and it's showing up given our occupancy. Yes. We're working through a little bit on the new lease rate, but when you think about renewals, and where how we're renewing right now, even in a period that is typically slower in Q4, we're seeing really good demand to go in. So we're working through it, and we like our product. And where we stand long term relative to multi.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Derek Maxwell: Hi. Good morning. This is Derek Maxwell on for Adam. Thanks for the time. If we could just double-click on the same-store revenue growth assumptions a little bit. I don't know if you gave new and renewal lease expectations in that blended rate in the mid-3% range. And then it looks like your bad debt has been trending around 1% in Q3 and Q4. So just curious about the confidence in the improvement to 60, 90 basis points in 2025. Thanks.
John Olson: Hey. It's John. Thanks for the question. I think I'll start with bad debt. You know, our bad debt range reflects our expectation that we'll continue to see improvement in bad debt expense but a degree of cautiousness about the rate at which that improvement will continue. As you correctly noted, you know, 2024 was sort of a tale of two halves. We saw a real material improvement in the first half of last year, then a little bit of a backup in the second half. You know, I think the first half improvement was down to, you know, a number of markets where timelines in the court system started to shrink. And then I think what we're seeing today is we still have, you know, a couple three markets where the timelines remain elongated. You know, markets like Atlanta, the Carolinas, specifically Mecklenburg County, Chicago, you know, it still takes quite a while to get some of these situations worked through the system. And so we just want to be cautious. So we do believe we'll continue to see improvement. We're really focused on collections. We're really focused on being as efficient as we can be. But want to be mindful of kind of what that second half experience was last year. We did not give a guide around new versus renewal rate growth for 2025. We're not gonna do that, but, you know, feel very comfortable that the mid-three blended guide incorporates sort of our expectation for renewal rate growth that continues to remain sticky sort of in that 4% to 5% range that Dallas talked about, high renewal rate. And then, you know, a typical seasonality curve that, you know, maybe looks a little bit different than it did pre-pandemic. But I think the pattern in terms of the quarterly trends really remains the same. I would also note that, you know, as you look at 2025, would expect that, you know, core revenue growth and NOI growth will be a little bit higher in the second half of the year than the first half of the year, primarily due to how our quarterly comp shake out. You know, as we said at the outset, we think that this our guidance and our sort of outlook on 2025 is appropriately measured given the supply backdrop, you know, we feel good about the trends we're seeing on the ground here in the very early part of 2025, but, you know, it's really early in the year. A lot of things can happen, so we just want to be mindful of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jesse Lederman with Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead.
Jesse Lederman: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Sounds like you're expecting a pretty nice contribution from third-party management in 2025. Just looking under the hood in the fourth quarter, it looks like revenue and expenses for 3PM increased sequentially and units under management actually inch lower sequentially. So can you talk about the moving pieces there? And embedded within the two cents of incremental, for 2025, do you expect that to come mostly from units or expanding margin? Thanks.
John Olson: Hey, Jesse. It's John. Yeah. I'll just say this. I mean, I think the third-party managed portfolio is going to ebb and flow a little bit. Hopefully, you know, we'll be looking to find new accounts to add. But, you know, our customers do periodically want to prune their own portfolio. That's an important part of our role as asset manager is sort of sharing with them our perspective on, you know, which assets make sense from a risk-adjusted total return perspective, with which assets would allow them to improve the overall growth and margin profile of their own book by sort of shedding those assets. So look, we feel very good. The contribution, as I noted at the outset, to 2025 earnings will be about two cents incremental from our third-party management business and our JV business. You know, that reflects sort of a full-year earn-in this year as well as the various structures in terms of how we receive fee income over time. But, look, as I said, I think it's a great business. You know, we have and I think you sort of implicitly suggested we have, you know, higher PME expenses. We've had to scale to absorb that new line of business. I think as you look at 2025, our run rate in terms of PME and G&A will probably be a skosh lower than it was here in the fourth quarter as we continue to extract efficiencies. You know, when we first introduced this new line of business, we noted that we were gonna need to scale up, make some investments in the platform, make some investments in people, and that over time and distance, we would understand kind of what was the appropriate structure to efficiently manage that business together with our wholly-owned business. I think we have much greater insight into what that looks like now. And so as Dallas said, we're really focused on getting as efficient as we can be in terms of how we manage the totality of the properties, whether we own them, manage them, or whatever the case may be.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. And it's a two-part question around your comments on external growth. One, are you actively considering expanding into international markets? Into Dallas when I hear we're exploring avenues outside of traditional SFR. My mind goes to new property sectors, so more detail around the nontraditional avenues of growth would be appreciated.
Dallas Tanner: Alright. Thanks, John. On the first question, no. We're not currently contemplating office in Rio de Janeiro or anything like that. All jokes aside, we see a great opportunity here in the US to continue to look for ways to meaningfully add scale, as I mentioned earlier. Well, you know, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our NOI margin continues to enhance scale, and we get better at offering our services in a more cost-effective way over time. But we, I guess you could never say never, but that's not in the cards right now. Secondly, as we think about, you know, stuff that's outside of traditional SFR, there's sort of two ways to think about that. One is, you know, Scott and I are looking at a number of opportunities where we can, you know, lend strength to regional operators or builders in a way that might help, you know, sort of lower their cost of capital, but create meaningful opportunities for us to close on those assets at the end of maybe a construction or delivery cycle. So those are things that we're looking at. We've done more townhome projects candidly in the last year. Looked at more opportunities of, you know, where candidly single-family rental units, but maybe they share a common wall but they have all the aspects and characteristics of our business. Typically, on the townhome product, we're looking at stuff that's much more intel. So higher gross economic pricing, higher gross economic rents, and the ability to sort of compress costs across that scale. And, you know, I think lastly, we're gonna pay attention. Is there a convergence at some point where you see more multifamily and SFR? In operating structures? We certainly see that with smaller companies today. It's not something we're, you know, we're currently thinking about, but we are keeping our eyes open to look for opportunities to add meaningful scale in parts of markets that we're already in and or maybe new markets as I mentioned before.
Operator: Your next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Just hoping you could talk a little bit about G&A and kind of what we should be modeling for 2025. You noted some step-ups with regards to 3PM and the joint venture business. And also, just give us some color on the applications around CapEx for homes and has been pretty flat and how that may or may not be impacted by tariffs that are out there.
John Olson: Sure. Thanks, Juan. It's John. I think in the fourth quarter, PME and G&A on a combined basis was around $54 million, $56 million, I think. And as I noted a couple of questions ago, we think that the run rate on that is gonna be a Scotia lower. So, you know, kind of $51, $52 million quarterly. As we have sort of rationalized some of our costs and figured out how to maximize the efficiency with which we, you know, operate our business. Our hope is that we'll continue to extract additional efficiency gains over time, but that is not baked into our guide. Juan, can you remind me of the second part of your question? I'm sorry.
Juan Sanabria: Spending for home?
John Olson: Oh, thanks. Yeah. Look. I think part of the reason that you've seen a flattening there, honestly, is we have been investing the majority of our external growth opportunities into new product. Additionally, as we've talked about in the past, we have a unique ability in, you know, the real estate landscape to asset manage on a unit-by-unit basis. So to the extent that, you know, certain homes within the portfolio start to exhibit patterns of materially higher sort of capital reinvestment need, we can go ahead and dispose of those assets and recycle the capital into newer homes and locations that we feel good about. That are gonna have a lower long-term cost to maintain.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Blouin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Julien Blouin: Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. Dallas, you gave some really helpful color on the supply dynamics. And you mentioned that you expect a bit more spec inventory maybe based on comments from Publix and regional builders. Can you help frame sort of how large that spec supply impact could be? And, also, what's your sense of how the quality, maybe the features, and the locations of those in that spec inventory compares to your own portfolio?
Dallas Tanner: Great question. I'll add a little bit of commentary on top of what Scott said earlier. I mean, we are seeing with some of our partners and people that we do a lot of business with, you know, every month, every quarter just sort of getting to see opportunities on spec that sort of fit the profile of our traditional product. We love it, candidly. We love the product quality that both the public and the private builders generally have in place. We're not seeing anything that alarms us in terms of builders both at a big scale or maybe a regional scale that are putting so much product out in the pipeline that it causes us to be fearful. I think we're just recognizing the fact that there is a bid-ask spread in the market right now between where mortgage rates are and maybe where deliveries are coming in. And so with that, I would expect that Scott and the team will be a little bit more aggressive in buying both scattered in those opportunities and also in our strategic thinking around when we do a development, remember, we're pretty agnostic. We're fine taking development bets on large sections of master plans. We're also fine sprinkling within a community over scale and density. It looks and feels like 80,000 of our current home business. So I don't see anything on the horizon that suggests that there's such a major tilt that it's a problem. Just recognizing that we're seeing a little bit more deal flow and this stuff tends to change quarter to quarter. Based on the market dynamics. Right now, those dynamics, as you guys know, is mortgage rates are elevated, people still want access to good quality product. It's about $1,100 a month cheaper to lease a home from us than it would be to buy that similar home in that market. So we're taking advantage of that dislocation.
Operator: Your next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Yes. Hi. You are over 97% in occupancy for most of last year and are guiding to 96.5%. Which markets are you expecting a bigger shift to blend to the slower rate?
Charles Young: Yeah. This is Charles. Good question. Look, this time of year, we've set ourselves up well to capitalize on spring leasing season and building occupancy kind of across the board. But as we mentioned last year, we're starting to see some supply challenges in Central Florida, Texas, Phoenix. Those are the markets that we're just being thoughtful about that may not build back occupancy as high as we have in California or Seattle. Or, you know, maybe the Carolinas. So, you know, as we look at, you know, our ability to lease those homes when they turn over, we're having to need a bit more on price in a number of those markets. And we just want to be thoughtful to try to capture as much of that rate as possible and understand that it may have an impact on occupancy. I think the other thing to think about is turnover is remaining really low. So that's really great, and I think on the renewal side, we're seeing really healthy numbers. And overall, you know, turnover is staying where we think it's healthy. So it's really about the numbers coming in based on how long we're having to stay on market. And certain markets have more supply than others. Across the board, we're seeing a little bit of an uptick on supply, which is normal coming off of COVID. But that's not material in most markets. It's in the market that we're talking about that I think we'll see a little less occupancy.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jade Rahman with KBW. Please go ahead.
Jason Sabshon: Hi. This is Jason Sabshon on for Jade. Are you guys seeing any increased interest in third parties and partnering or taking interest in the portfolio? Because SFR certainly remains a high-interest sector for institutional investors. Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: You know, Scott and I get inbounds all the time with people that are curious, like, what's our program? How do we think about 3PM? Could we help operating margins be more efficient? You know, prospective partners. I want to emphasize sort of two broad points, and then, Scott, feel free to add any color. One is that we're only really interested in partners that have scale and that have pretty similar market overlap. That's the first point. And two, that want to operate their portfolios in a manner that's very in line with how we run our own business. So leaning in on the areas that scale and efficiency give you. Scott, there's nothing really color to note, but just generally, we're definitely on people's radar out of the things.
Scott Eisen: Yeah. I mean, we get inbounds frequently. And I think for us, it's really, as Dallas said, about finding, you know, LPs or prospective partners that we think are sophisticated, institutional, and like-minded. And also for people, we also want to look at portfolios that sort of are in our five-box in terms of the types of homes that we manage today. There are people that come to us with markets where we don't operate. There are people that come to us with a different business segment not necessarily where we're trying to pay. And so we try to be focused on that. But, clearly, this is, you know, in terms of, you know, obviously, when we look at our potential partnerships, you know, these partners are obviously holders of assets, but we'll explore selling or pruning some or all of those portfolios over time. And clearly, when our partners decide if they want to prune a little bit or a lot, we get a first look at those assets. And every single time a partner would like to sell assets out of the portfolio, we evaluate the acquisition, and we have an early look in a discussion with them on whether it's an opportunity for us to wholly own it within our portfolio. And this is part of our regular dialogue. And we view all of our third-party and joint venture partners as being opportunities for future growth for us.
Operator: Your final follow-up question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thanks. I think you covered a bit of it in the last question. But, you know, we've now seen Welltower raise their fund. Obviously, ProLogistix is a pretty robust fund business. Just what is your appetite for whether they're finite infinite life funds or even larger single investor JVs. And if, you know, I'll ask a follow-up question now since I can't do it regularly. So and if that's the case, how would you think about what would go on balance sheet versus into third-party structures? And if we could see down the road you're adding a promote to your either business model or your comp structure.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks for the questions, plural. I'll try to make sure that I tackle basically, just broad strokes around how we think about our JVs and what we're focused on. As we mentioned and as we reconfirmed in the earnings transcript, we were successful in raising another joint venture with what we think is a very high-quality partner here in the US that gives us added flexibility as we come across opportunities. Primarily, probably in the new construction space, but it'll lend itself to lots of creative thinking together as we look to maximize returns both for our shareholders and for theirs. Right now, our focus has been, and this is our third joint venture that we've announced in the history of the business and really probably the third in the last four to five years. It gives us an extra layer of creative capital to go after opportunities that may warrant different structures, different leverage structures as well. And so we're finishing deploying one other venture right now while looking at opportunities to invest in this new venture. And we have a very, matter of fact, clear and transparent structure on how we rotate those opportunities. They don't all fit into the same buckets, which makes it easy for us as well. And we certainly are looking for ways to protect the reach that we can grow on balance sheet as much as possible. And what's nice about these joint venture partners, and I would argue that they are partners, is that we can work, you know, collectively to be smart around how we think about, you know, deploying the capital, what their structures are, relationship to your question around promotes, we don't get any detail of that publicly unless we get to a point that we think that we need to. And so at this point in time, I think what I would just say is we have excellent partners. They give us added flexibility. It's making us more opportunistic and allowing us to look at more opportunities for growth knowing that we've got that added layer of flexibility.
Operator: This completes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: We want to thank everyone again for joining us today. These are really exciting times for our company, Invitation Homes, and we feel privileged to work alongside such a talented team. Also want to extend gratitude and appreciation to Charles and join him in congratulating Tim. Both are exceptional leaders. They both play pivotal roles in driving Invitation Homes forward in the future and helping us achieve our long-term goals. We look forward to seeing everybody at the Citi Conference. Thanks.
Operator: That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-31 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Invitation Homes Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Scott McLaughlin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Scott McLaughlin: Good afternoon and welcome. I’m here today from Invitation Homes with Dallas Tanner, Chief Executive Officer; Charles Young, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jon Olsen, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Eisen, Chief Investment Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session with our covering sell-side analysts. [Operator Instructions] During today’s call, we may reference our third quarter 2024 earnings release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed, and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Except to the extent otherwise required by law, Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures in yesterday’s earnings release. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Dallas Tanner, our Chief Executive Officer.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect the hard work of our teams to maintain high occupancy control costs and continue to provide an outstanding experience for our residents, who are now staying with us nearly 38 months on average. I’m particularly thankful for the work our associates have done to demonstrate our trademark genuine care to residents impacted by the recent hurricanes. When we started this business a dozen years ago or so, what was clear to us then remains clear to us now. There is a strong need and a desire for choice and flexibility when it comes to leasing a home. This is evident by not only the 14 million Americans who choose to lease a home today, but also by the 110,000 households that choose to lease with us. We are very proud of being a premier single-family home leasing and management company that is committed to remaining the most transparent and offering the highest service while providing the best overall resident experience of any other provider. Our goal is to make leasing a home as easy, convenient and care-free as leasing a car or running a vacation home. Thanks to the hard work of our teams, our external growth initiatives and our investments in technology, I’m pleased with how far we’ve come and where we still aim to go. This includes our rapid expansion into third-party management, which together with our joint venture business has now reached over 25,000 homes. It also includes our strategic homebuilder relationships that we continue to deepen and grow and the expansion of our value-add services like smart home and bundled Internet. Our value-add services are on track to achieve our target of over $60 million in gross revenues this year and we continue to explore additional ways we can offer convenient and desirable amenities for our residents. Returning to our current results. Last night’s earnings release contained our latest expectations for the full year 2024. These reflect our penny raise at the midpoint for both core FFO and AFFO per share, along with very favorable same-store expense updates that Jon will discuss in detail in a moment. In addition, our revised guidance includes some moderation in same-store revenue growth during the second half of the year. As we’ve pointed out previously, this is due in part to a return to a healthier more sustainable cycle following the significant market rent growth we experienced during the past 3 years. In addition, as we noted on our July call, it’s also being driven by some supply and absorption pressures, including from new BTR listings and motivated for lease pricing in a few of our markets, primarily Phoenix, Tampa, Orlando and Dallas. With peak BTR deliveries already behind us and with a large drop-off in new starts that began in 2023, it’s expected that new BTR deliveries could fall as much as 65% next year. Based on this, we believe the current supply pressures are temporary in nature and that our team’s focus on absorption over the next few quarters will help us to work through this period. Outside of the near-term noise, we believe these markets remain attractive for long-term risk-adjusted returns with strong population, job and future rent growth. In that regard, our investment thesis remains supported by the demographics, which remain very exciting for our business. John Burns research expects the number of renter households to grow by nearly 0.5 million people per year for the next 4 years and to continue growing strong beyond that through 2033. It’s been over 10 years since we’ve seen a renter expansion of that magnitude. We believe our portfolio of homes is uniquely positioned to benefit from that long-term demand growth. Burns also notes that there will be over 13,000 people turning 35 years old in this country every day for at least the next 10 years, which is right in the ballpark of our average new resident age of approximately 38 years old. With that macro picture intact and fundamentals remaining strong, we continue to be as bullish as we’ve been in our business and its future prospects. In closing, I’d like to once again thank all of our teams for their hard work, their dedication as well as our investors for their continued trust and support. We remain excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us, and we expect to continue achieving solid growth that remain among the strongest in the residential REIT sector. With that, I’ll now pass the call on to Charles Young, our President and Chief Operating Officer.
Charles Young: Thank you, Dallas. As you mentioned, it’s been a busy time for our associates, many of whom have worked tirelessly to help our residents impacted by recent hurricanes. Based on our early assessment, we believe we experienced mostly limited damages from these storms. The majority of the work orders created so far have been related to roofs, fencing and general service requests, and both our internal maintenance teams and our network of vendors are actively engaged across our markets. I’m really proud of the response and the assistance that we have provided to our residents and their communities. While these moments can be challenging, they also highlight some of the many benefits of leasing with us. Our mobile maintenance app allows our residents to log maintenance requests, attach pictures of storm damage and send these to us right away so we know what to expect before we even pull into the driveway. Meanwhile, our large network of roofers, tree cutting crews and debris haulers and our dedicated team of associates who live within the local communities allow us to deliver fast, efficient and effective service and maintenance that we believe is unrivaled in the industry. In addition, we believe our premier quality locations and genuine care leads us to the best outcomes for our residents and our business. These attributes not only help us attract great residents but also help us keep turnover low as satisfied residents typically stay longer. As Dallas mentioned earlier, our average length of stay is now approaching 38 months, while same-store turnover for the trailing four quarters was just 23% among the best in the industry. Against that backdrop, I’ll now discuss our third quarter same-store leasing results. Renewal rent growth was 4.2%, a solid result that is in line with more normal third quarter renewal growth rates. New lease rent growth was 1.7%, which together with renewals, brought our blended rent growth to 3.6%. Third quarter same-store core revenues grew 3.6% year-over-year, primarily driven by a 3.7% increase in average monthly rent, a 10 basis point year-over-year improvement in bad debt and a 2.4% increase in other income. Occupancy averaged a healthy 97% during the third quarter, nearly the same as the prior year result. Meanwhile, our associates did a great job in controlling costs during the third quarter. Same-store core expenses increased only 3.1% year-over-year, driven by moderation in our fixed expense growth of 5.3% and a 0.5% decrease in controllable expenses. Taken together, this resulted in a year-over-year increase of 3.9% in same-store NOI. Looking ahead now to our preliminary October same-store leasing results. Average occupancy was 96.5%, in line with September results. In addition, October renewal rent growth is coming in at 3.7%, while new lease rents contracted 1.4%, achieving blended rent growth of 2.2%. To Dallas’ earlier point, these preliminary October results reflect some continued supply and absorption pressures that we’re experiencing in a few of our markets. As a reminder, we’ve seen it before when new supply influences market pricing, such as in Las Vegas last year, and we worked through it. We’re also encouraged by some preliminary signs heading into November. While it’s still early, these include solid acceleration in our renewal rent growth with nearly 3/4 of our book already completed north of 4% as well as improved absorption. We remain optimistic as we approach the end of the year. To wrap up, it’s been a dynamic year for our associates, who I’d like to thank once again for a great job in serving our residents, enabling our rapid growth through homebuilder acquisitions and third-party management and ensuring everyone is safe and sound in their homes. I know we have the right team in place to push the focus and support one another as we work towards our goals for the remainder of the year. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Jon Olsen, our Chief Financial Officer.
Jon Olsen: Thanks, Charles. Today, I’ll walk through an update on our investment-grade balance sheet, discuss several of our recent capital markets activities and then wrap up with our third quarter financial results and revised full year guidance. I’ll start with our balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had over $2 billion in available liquidity through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility. Over 3/4 of our total debt was unsecured, and our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 5.4x, slightly better than our targeted range of 5.5x to 6x. Following next month’s anticipated payoff of our 2018 for securitization, we’ll have no debt reaching final maturity until 2027. In addition, over 99% of our total debt was fixed rate or swapped to fixed rate and 84% of our wholly owned homes were unencumbered as of quarter end. These strong metrics come alongside several third quarter achievements that improve the quality and strength of our investment-grade balance sheet. I’ll call out four of these. First, Fitch Ratings upgraded our issuer and issue-level credit ratings from BBB flat to BBB+ with a stable outlook. Second, we replaced our $3.5 billion bank credit facility with a new $3.5 billion senior unsecured credit facility, consisting of a $1.75 billion revolving line of credit and a $1.75 billion term loan both reaching final maturity in September 2029. Our cost of funds for the new credit facility improved by about 15 basis points. Third, in early September, we took advantage of an attractive window to issue $500 million of 4 7/8% senior notes due in February 2035, further extending our debt maturity ladder. These bonds priced at a spread of 128 basis points over the 10-year treasury or about 5 basis points better than what secondary trading in our existing bonds implied. And fourth, towards the end of the third quarter, we amended a number of our existing interest rate swaps and entered into new swap trades to effectively extend $1.4 billion of interest rate hedges through mid-2028 on average. After our old swaps roll off and new swaps become active, we expect the weighted average strike rate of our swap book to stabilize at approximately 2.95% in mid-2025, only 9 basis points higher than the 2.86% weighted average strike rate of our current swap book. You can find more detail on specific swap rates and effective timing in Note 8 of our Form 10-Q. Next, I’ll cover our financial results for the third quarter. Core FFO and AFFO per share for the third quarter increased 6.8% and 7.2% year-over-year to $0.47 and $0.38 per share, respectively. These results were driven primarily by higher same-store NOI and exclude the incremental accrual relating to our FTC settlement, as well as estimated net casualty losses from third quarter storms, consistent with our historical approach. I’ll now review our revised full year 2024 guidance. Last night, we raised the midpoints of both our core FFO and AFFO per share guidance ranges by $0.01 to $1.88 and $1.59 per share, respectively. At the midpoints, our earnings guidance implies year-over-year growth of 6.2% and 6% for core FFO and AFFO per share, respectively. In addition, we’ve narrowed our same-store NOI growth guidance and maintained our 4.5% same-store NOI growth rate at the midpoint. As we’ve discussed, we’ve revised our expectations for more moderate same-store revenue growth in the second half of this year, and we’ve also significantly improved expectations for same-store expense growth primarily due to favorable information received to-date from Florida and Georgia, which together account for over half of our property tax expense. As a result, we have revised our full year guidance for property tax growth of 5% to 6.5% year-over-year. As we near the end of the year, I want to acknowledge the great progress we’ve made in the first 10 months. These achievements are a testament to the hard work and discipline of our associates, and I’m thankful for what we’ve accomplished. That said, we know we need to remain focused and agile as we approach the remainder of the year, and I have every confidence we’ll deliver on this front. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is open.
Michael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. The sequential occupancy decline in the third quarter was approximately in line with historical norms, but renewal and new lease spreads both fell below the pre-COVID norms. I suspect just given the environment of high cost of alternative housing and good demand, you would have a bit more pricing power. Can you walk through kind of what [Technical Difficulty] on the spreads here and you can also break out how the spreads are performing in markets facing build pressure and those that are not? Thank you.
Charles Young: This is Charles. You broke up a little bit, but I think I got the gist of what you’re asking. Look, as we highlighted in our opening remarks, we’re seeing some supply pressure in a handful of markets, specifically on the new lease side, which is making us compete on price. That slower absorption is really happening in markets like Tampa, Orlando, Phoenix, Dallas and we’ve seen this before. We talked about it in Vegas, we dealt with this in ‘23 and kind of worked through it over a few quarters. And outside of those markets, the rest of them are kind of expecting – are acting as we expected. Normal seasonality as you get into the end of Q3. But other than that, there are no real surprises there. Overall, for those markets that we’re talking about in the rest of the book, the good news is turnover remains low. If you just look across where we stand, we’re at historically low on turnover. So we’re renewing at a really high rate. Our renewal book is generally where we expect on seasonal levels, to your question, an 80% renewal rate is super healthy. So overall occupancy is about where we see normally, maybe down a little bit from what we expected early in the year. But we expect that we’re going to absorb pretty quickly here. The demand remains strong. We’re going to have to kind of work through these markets that are seeing a little bit more temporary supply. And we take – we figured that it will take a couple of quarters. But overall, the book is in a healthy shape, we just need to work through these few markets that are a little slower to absorb right now. Operator?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Steve Sakwa: Hi, great. Good afternoon. Maybe just on the capital deployment front, I didn’t know if Scott can maybe talk about maybe how the yield landscape is changing with the builders, I know rates have bounced around quite a bit and so trying to figure out exact cost of capital is difficult. But I’m just curious if you are seeing better opportunities to buy homes today and how you are thinking about the yield expectations on new development purchases from the builders?
Scott Eisen: Great question, Steve. Thanks. Listen, in terms of what we did for the third quarter, first of all, I’m a little over 1 year into my role here, and I’m very pleased with the progress that the team has made in terms of building our builder backlog, diversifying our relationships with multiple builders. And look, we’re very pleased with the deal flow that we’re seeing from the builder community. As you saw in terms of what we announced in the third quarter, we closed almost 900 homes for $320 million at around a 6% cap. Year-to-date, we’ve closed about 1,600 homes for a total deployment of about $560 million. We still are seeing builder transactions in terms of our forward pipeline and dialogue with them in and around a 6 cap. Obviously, there was a brief period here with the 10-year dip down where mortgage rates dropped briefly, but then obviously, it’s risen up again here. But I’d say in terms of our dialogue, it’s a very strategic dialogue we’re having discussions with them, not about stuff that’s been delivered in 30 days, but stuff that’s 3, 6 to 9 months out. I think we’re very pleased with that dialogue and what we’re seeing. And I think it’s sort of too soon to tell in terms of whether there’s going to be any material change given what’s happening in the homebuilding industry. But I think we’re happy with what we’re seeing. And again, we’re still sort of in the market and trying to target in and around a 6.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Your line is open.
Eric Wolfe: Hey, thanks. You mentioned that you’re confident that the business will generate growth at the top end of the residential space going forward. So with that in mind, I was just hoping you could share – any thoughts on next year in terms of earn-in, maybe where your loss to lease is going to be at year-end or just anything else you think we should think about for next year’s growth potential?
Jon Olsen: Thanks, Eric. I think we’ll hold off on talking about next year until we reconvene in about 90 days. I think to your point about earn-in, I think that’s around 2%. We’ll be in a position where we can potentially talk about loss to lease a little bit later in the year when it’s more relevant as a jump off. But I think for now, we’ll kind of leave it at that.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just thinking more strategically, if you look at your development pipeline and where you’re growing, Tampa, Orlando seem to be some of the bigger markets, same with AMH. Those are also where the builders tend to be giving the most concessions and are the most active as well. I mean, any thoughts here on diversifying the portfolio more growing in different markets or do you think this is more just one-time in nature and the market will just kind of right-size itself and things get back to normal?
Dallas Tanner: Hey, it’s a great question. This is Dallas. It’s interesting, right? We’ve been in this business now almost a dozen years. And I think as we’ve sort of watched how the cycles ebb and flow, to your point, there’s certainly different pockets of opportunity along the way that are both sometimes market dependent, whereas you see, to your point, maybe an overbuild situation or a little softness in some of the normalized construction sales. You also can see that times and seasons in the resale market. We obviously took advantage of the resale market early on in the formation of the business, but we’ve pivoted obviously, in the last couple of years, Scott noted it earlier. I mean we are extremely happy with the new product both from a full community aspect and also a scattered site that we are doing now with a number of both public and private homebuilders. We think there’s more room probably to go upstream there over time, in terms of generating better returns, maybe taking on a little bit more inherent risk. But the reality is you’ve got to time this based on sort of a long view, both from a demographic perspective, and from a new supply perspective. And so you’re right, we would expect that if the market cools a little bit more, and we’re seeing some of this in the homebuilder numbers today, there’ll be more opportunities. And there’ll rationally be really level-headed conversations around how we could either help support taking on new supply because there’s plenty of renter demand generally over a long horizon, but also just be diligent about where we want to have that exposure. Not all markets are created equal. We have markets that are high NOI margin markets maybe a little bit less growth or more growth, then we have markets where maybe property tax and a few things can weigh on the expense side, but they’re very high growth in nature. And so I think balancing that approach as we think about new markets that we may or may not enter and we can talk a little bit about Nashville and some of these markets where we started to get a little bit more exposure will all go into the soup of how we think about the next 3 to 5 years.
Scott Eisen: And what I would add here, this is Scott, is in terms of for the quarter. Obviously, you saw that we had some overweighting in Denver, Tampa and the Carolinas for our acquisitions backlog. We are in active dialogue with the builders about doing in all of our IH growth markets. And so Phoenix, Vegas, Denver, Nashville, these are markets where we’re in active dialogue with the builders and evaluating and underwriting opportunities. So our aperture and lens for where we want to focus our investments, it’s not just in the markets where we had some volume for the quarter. When we look at the quarter, they were actually included in our 900 homes were closing for the quarter, was 4 communities that we bought from either developers or homebuilders that were either partially or fully leased in terms of the acquisition opportunities. So we’re excited what we see out there, and we’re looking to go to other markets as well.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Adam Kramer: Great. Thanks for the time. I was wondering if you could maybe quantify the impact of new supply say in one of your markets. And maybe as well, I think the narrative is that a lot of this new supply is build to rent, likely more on the kind of periphery of market. If you could just quantify how much this is affecting your infill homes, which you would think would be a little bit more insulated versus maybe your build to rent, your homebuilder partnership home that you would think would be a little bit more at risk from this new supply. Just quantify the difference in performance to kind of see the impact of this new supply would be really helpful?
Dallas Tanner: Hey, Adam. Great question. And it’s different by market, little bit anecdotal, and I’ll let Charles jump up at the top here if he wants to add anything. But I think if you just look at, for example, like say, the top 20 operators in the SFR space, and we track a lot of this information because it’s out there publicly. You look at listings being up somewhere between 15% and 20% in aggregate versus where maybe it was at the beginning of the year or early spring. That’s sort of indicative of the things we’re seeing in Phoenix, Tampa, Orlando. Some of these markets like Phoenix, for example, they started to peak at the end of Q1, but they were getting like 700 to 800 new BTR deliveries on a month-over-month basis. Now I think the piece of it that we’re pretty bullish on, and we mentioned in our opening remarks that we think this takes a few quarters to sort of work itself through, is the expectation, and this is tracked by a number of economists is that a lot of those BTR deliveries come down by about 60% to 65% next year. So while we are fighting for new occupants on the new lease side, we see little or no impact on the renewal side of our business. Going back to the past three quarters, we renewed Q1 at 80%, Q2 at 78% and Q3 at 79%. All that what we would do is sort of pre-pandemic, pretty normal and historic rates as we’ve come off of the peaks 2 years ago. So renewal business feels great. New lease in spots has some dislocation. And by the way, on the flip side, you’re seeing that in the Midwest, where we’re getting 10% and 11% new lease growth in Chicago. We’ve never seen that before. So in those areas of the country where there hasn’t been much building in the last 3 or 4 years, that’s going to lend itself to some near-term sort of rate help. And I think in these parts of the markets where there’s been a lot of development and investment starting really 2 or 3 years ago, those deliveries are coming on, and we’ll just deal with that over the next couple of quarters. Nothing we can’t handle.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jesse Lederman with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Jesse Lederman: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You lowered revenue growth guidance last quarter as well. So can you talk about what happened incrementally during the quarter or for your outlook for the fourth quarter that were not embedded within your outlook 3 months ago? Thank you.
Jon Olsen: Jesse, it’s Jon. Thanks for your question. Yeah, I think let’s look back at where we were, right? So NAREIT fell first week of June, we were coming off the first 5 months of 2024 that exceeded our lofty expectations for the year. We were very, very bullish. Towards the end of June, you started to see some softness emerge in a handful of markets, and by the time of our July call, we thought it was prudent to acknowledge that we weren’t going to continue on the same trajectory. I think subsequent to that, we got more and better visibility into some of the supply pressures and the degree to which we were going to need to be able to compete on the basis of price, coupled with sort of a slower rate of absorption in the markets and you put it all together, and I think our revision here is reflective of just a more fulsome picture of exactly what’s happening on the ground that was only just emerging at the time of our July call.
Operator: Next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. I just want to follow up on the throughout of the conversation theme. Charles and Dallas, you said the renewal book looks great as expected. You did expect renewal growth rates to accelerate and now your renewal growth rate is lower than some built apartments. And so I’m struggling with that tone and the renewals are great and as expected. Clearly, there’s more price sensitivity on the existing tenants and it seems to be more broad-based than just certain pockets of the portfolio. Can you expand on that? Because I think me and others are confused in the market right now.
Charles Young: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Look, we – I think we signaled over the summer that since August, we’ve been increasing our renewal ask. And as it’s been working through the book, we were kind of flat from September to October. But as I mentioned in our earlier statements, we’re seeing nice acceleration now from November. It’s too early to call December, but we expect it will continue to accelerate from there. So it’s hard to predict exactly when these things will hit. But we’re seeing, as we look at our book, that there’s some be acceleration there. And so at this point, we’re kind of coming off a bottom here in September, October, and accelerating nicely. On top of what Dallas just said, we’re also renewing at a high level. And as you try – and you’re in a market like this, we’re trying to get to the optimized kind of balance of revenue, you also want to close the back door. And so we think about all that as we do this and so we feel good about where we are in renewals overall.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Josh Dennerlein: Hey, guys. Sorry to harp on that, but it looks like you did say on the 2Q call, you were going out with that 7% ask on renewals, and I think I heard, what like all 4s for October. I guess just how does that negotiation compare with like prior periods, like that seems like wide? Or is that normal for you guys?
Charles Young: A couple of thoughts. I think the reality is when we talked about this, is we were seeing early supply and absorption noise in these few markets as we talked about, Tampa, Orlando, Dallas, Phoenix, and we wanted our teams to make sure that they weren’t turning over too much into those markets. So we had them adjust and compete on price. And if you go back and look at our numbers, that’s where we saw some of the softness. And now that we’re kind of working through and as we’ve talked about, we’re absorbing well here in October and going into November, we’re optimistic that we’re going to continue to kind of build the book back. We’re seeing some confidence where those markets can hold a bit more than they were as we were seeing the softness coming to the end of the summer, typical seasonality and all that. So as I said, month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, there’ll be a little bit of adjustment, but we’ve gone out at higher rates, and we’re going to start to capture those over time.
Operator: Next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good afternoon. Just picked your question on strategy, you guys have a significant exposure to Florida. Obviously, climate is changing, whether – we could debate the causes or not. But curious on if you’re comfortable holding that weighting longer term, and then hurricanes seem to be part of just life in general today. And why we should be normalizing those costs out? It just seems like part of doing business or the cost of doing business in those markets?
Dallas Tanner: Hey, Juan, Dallas. I’ll address the first part. Ordinary course for us with asset management is always to look at sort of weighting of the book. And clearly, as you would expect, with Florida specifically, really, over the last 10 years, we’ve constantly looked at ways to sort of help shape the book so that we’re out of flood plains and we’re doing things that are a little bit more careful because we’re so bullish on sort of Florida’s growth profile overall. And in terms of the way we think about total return, right, we want obviously, good revenue growth. We obviously need some asset appreciation. We have sold – I think we sold a few hundred homes this year in Florida. There’s times and seasons where we sold more, particularly in South Florida. We really like the prospects hurricanes aside of the growth story that’s probably in Central Florida, around Tampa and Orlando. A lot of really interesting fun facts on the ground, things we’re seeing with businesses, household formation, net migration, multicultural sort of net migration into those markets. We think there is a lot of reasons to be long on those for a long time. And you see some of that in the information.
Scott Eisen: And then just to be clear, when you look back over the last 4 years or so, we continue to, as Dallas said, the portfolio. And I think over the last 4 years, we sold almost 1,600 homes in Florida. So, we continue to actively asset manage the portfolio and we are very focused on kind of what that proportionality is.
Jon Olsen: Yes. Juan, it’s Jon. To the last part of your question, I would just point out that, we have a large portfolio in the Southeastern U.S. and Florida. So, storms have been and will continue to be a part of life. But when we think about that, I think it’s important to remember a few things. One, over the course of our history, we have had many years without any material storm impact. We have also had years like 2024 where hurricane season has proven to be more active, but we have a really well established playbook that we stand ready to activate when and as if needed. I would also point out that we are well insured. Our portfolio is neither coastal, it’s not waterfront. And over the course of our entire operating history, we have a very favorable loss history we can point to that benefits our property program renewal as we think about managing the risk in markets like that. Lastly, I would just point out that our underwriting approach and our asset management approach that lets us sort of manage on a house-by-house basis allows us to minimize the number of properties in the book that might otherwise contribute outsized risk relative to the rest of the portfolio. So, examples of that would be flood maps are redrawn periodically. And so if 123 Main Street wasn’t previously mapped in a special flood hazard area, and then the maps are redrawn, and now it is, well that sets off a flag for Scott’s team and on an asset management basis that becomes an immediate disposition candidate. When we are underwriting homes, we look at flood maps, we look at the year of construction, and we compare that to when the building codes went through substantial changes over time. So, these are all things that we do and work with, with our insurance consultants to manage the risk, shape the portfolio such that, as Dallas said, we can feel good about the risk-adjusted total return opportunity in those markets, which we think is still very compelling.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey guys. I had a question on other income, pretty light this quarter. I think the growth was up 3% versus I think double digits in prior quarters. Is that a tough comps, or something else, maybe some color there. And then the impact on third-party management in the quarter, can you tell me what that was? And then maybe what we should think about that line item on an annualized basis going forward. Thanks.
Jon Olsen: Thanks Haendel. Can you repeat the second part of your question? I apologize.
Haendel St. Juste: Second part was on the third-party management income, so just curious.
Jon Olsen: Yes. So, I think – with respect to fee income, of the $19 million of total fee income in the third quarter, about $15 million of that was related to third-party management and the balance was from various joint ventures. I think that $15 million quarterly number is a pretty decent run rate going forward. We will keep you updated to the extent that, that changes with either growth or dispositions or other sort of fee income streams that maybe aren’t activated at the moment. But it feels as though there is probably a little bit of upside to that because the upward America deal took place midway through the third quarter. Not particularly big in the grand scheme of things. So, I think that $15 million run rate number makes a decent amount of sense. With respect to other income, we continue to see pretty strong growth in some areas of that book, particularly Internet and media, sort of those bundled services. You have to remember that as our occupancy has taken a little bit of a dip, that’s going to flow through with respect to the other income lines as well. So, I would say that, that is not unexpected in light of the totality of the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Brad Heffern: Yes. Thanks. Hi everybody. On the storm costs, can you give some additional color on how the insurance policy is working or give the figure on how much damage insurance is actually paying for. $50 million plus of exposure just seems like a large number, so trying to figure out how it got there.
Jon Olsen: Yes, it’s a good question. I mean I think in terms of the quantum, we are talking about four named windstorms that affected markets where we own a lot of homes. So, I think that’s the first observation that I want to make sure we sort of establish upfront. In terms of how the insurance program works, we have a $200 million per occurrence limit for named windstorm, which means that for every named windstorm, we have coverage of up to $200 million for the 72-hour continuous period from when the named windstorm begins. So, put another way, if there were multiple named storms – named windstorms that struck more than 72 hours apart, each of those occurrences would have a $200 million limit. With respect to things like deductibles it varies a little bit like by location. So, in Texas and Florida, our deductible is 5% of total insured value. So, just making up numbers here for illustrative purposes, if we had a $400,000 home and $100,000 of that was land value, then the 5% deductible on total insured value would be on the $300,000, so that would be a $15,000 deductible for that home. When you look at markets like Georgia or other markets outside of Texas and Florida, that deductible goes from 5% down to 2%.
Operator: Next question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. Can you guys characterize how traffic is trending either web or in person just on a year-over-year basis in the recent months? And whether you saw any seasonality and demand occur sooner? And then just kind of marry that with where kind of conversion rates on those prospects has also tracked? Thanks.
Charles Young: Yes. Where we sit today is quite healthy. And that’s why you hear us have some confidence that we are going to be able to absorb just having to compete on price to do that. If you look at our kind of website traffic quarter-over-quarter, Q2 to Q3, it’s up. Going back to last year, you were still kind of humming at that point, so slightly down year-over-year. But historically, as good as we have seen in any prior COVID period. Our showings are really healthy in terms of driving to a self-show and being able to then convert from there. So, across the markets, we are seeing real health. Again, there is just some supply to try to work through in the handful of markets that we talked about. But generally, we are running at a strong occupancy at mid-96 for this time of the year. We will build back from here and go into next year in a really healthy shape where demand seems to continue to be here. And we know that because we are in the right markets. And ultimately, we know that there is a long-term kind of dislocation between the amount of homes that are out there and the demand that we have for our products. So, we are seeing good demand, and we are going to keep chopping through it.
Operator: Next question is from Michael Gorman with BTIG. Your line is open.
Michael Gorman: Yes. Thanks. I had a question on NOI margins. We saw a pretty significant expansion obviously from pre-COVID levels and also a substantial expansion in other property income over that same window. And I am just wondering, as we think about margins going forward here, is there any potential headwind or kind of return to the mean here from some of the provisions with the FTC settlement that you accrued for in the quarter, whether that’s related to fee income growth or as was discussed earlier, other income growth as we kind of head into 2025? Thanks.
Jon Olsen: Hi. It’s Jon. Thanks for the question. I will just start off by making clear that we do not believe the FTC settlement is going to have any ongoing impact on the way we can run our business or the other income line specifically. The stipulations of that settlement agreement really have more to do with reporting and training and the like. And so just to be crystal clear, I don’t think there is a read-through in that regard. A lot of the margin expansion versus the pre-COVID period, I think is related to a number of things. One, clearly, we have been running at much higher occupancy, much stronger rental rate growth than what we saw pre-COVID. Will there be a bit of mean reversion, possibly. But I think it’s important to remember that over the course of those years, we have gotten much better at what we do and much more efficient. I think the resident experience continues to improve. I think turnover for this product type is going to continue to be low, certainly relative to multifamily and certainly relative to what I think are early years as a public company were. So, we feel really good about where we sit. I would also note that we are cautiously optimistic that we are finally seeing some real moderation with respect to property tax expense, and to the extent that, that rate of increase is more subdued going forward. That’s obviously going to have a benefit to our NOI margins over the coming years.
Operator: Next question is from Julien Blouin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Julien Blouin: Yes. Hi. I just wanted to go back to the renewal questions. I guess it sounds like the difference between ask and realized renewals is wider than historical. Do you sort of expect that to continue for the next maybe couple of quarters? How long can that sort of continue in some of these high-supply markets as you sort of focus on absorption?
Charles Young: Yes. Look, we – during COVID, we were kind of signaling kind of the changes and where we are going out. And based on this, we found it can be confusing in providing kind of the specific renewal ask. And so I think what’s most important is we focus in on kind of actual results going forward. And as I said, post-August, we have been asking more and more. It’s going to vary what that ask and spread is going to be based on all of the dynamics in the market-per-market. Per home, it really is it is a dynamic situation, so trying to kind of zero in on that spread isn’t as healthy as just focusing in on the results. And what we are seeing today is that we are going – we are from October to November with 75% of our book or close to in the bag, we are north of 4%, which is good acceleration and in early look into December, which is early, we are seeing further acceleration. So, that’s what really matters ultimately. And again, it’s going to vary month-to-month in terms of where we go out. But we like the results that we are seeing. People want to stay in our homes. There is demand in these markets. We believe even in the markets where we are having to compete on price. We believe in these markets long-term. This is where we want to be and this is where all the demographics and where jobs are being created are all positive. So, we are happy with where the book stands as we finish this year and go into 2025.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW. Your line is open.
Jason Sabshon: Hi. This is Jason Sabshon on for Jade. I would be curious to hear about what kind of cap rates you are seeing on new acquisitions and the bid-ask spread has narrowed and whether the 10-year move in the past month has had any impact? Thank you.
Scott Eisen: Hey. It’s a great question. It’s Scott. Yes, look, when we look at kind of what we are seeing, I kind of break it down into various channels here, right. And I think we have talked prior on the call in terms of the builders and deals we are seeing in the backlog on our forward purchases. And again, we are still sort of seeing those transactions in and around a 6% cap rate. We have definitely seen some, call it, stabilized communities come to market that are fully leased and it feels like what I am seeing out in the market today for some of these stabilized communities is in the 5.5% cap range, plus or minus. And obviously, there is a little less risk associated with a fully stabilized community as opposed to in a forward purchase where you have to take some execution risk on the leasing. And then as far as other markets, we really haven’t seen any meaningful activity in the MLS market, so it’s hard to really have an opinion on kind of what those cap rates are today. But in terms of the various channels we look at, that’s kind of where we are seeing the market today.
Operator: Next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Hey. Thanks for taking the follow-up. One for Dallas or Jon, given where your cost of capital is today, what’s the number one use in the source of funds we should expect in the coming quarters?
Dallas Tanner: Let me jump in, Jon, and then feel free to add anything. I would say, John, it’s always a balanced approach to where cost of capital is. I mean I think you saw that we did a pretty significant well-priced bond deal last month. I think total coupon was like 4.89. That’s a great cost of capital for us and some of the capital markets activity that Jon has been doing. We also continue to recycle, Scott talked about some of the dispositions and things that we are using. And lastly, I would say we have a significant amount of interest and third-party capital, wanting to come in and combine forces and look to expand our profile in our JVs and in the JV markets that we are operating. I think we can do a number of things. We have plenty of access to capital, as Jon talked about earlier, having done all the credit work and the credit facility work that he did earlier this year with the capital markets team. We have a decent amount of free cash flow that comes into the company. And we have the ability to issue in the event that we see things that could or could not make sense. All things being equal, we are going to continue to lean in on growth. I think the goal here is to continue to lean in and find ways to create accretive external growth profiles for the business over time in distance, continue to lean in on the organic programming we are doing around ancillary revenue and enhancing the customer experience and then eliminating the drag which will create additional free cash flow for the company as well with some of our processes that are centered around resident retention. And I think the team is doing an excellent job on kind of those three fronts. So, if we come up against some opportunities, we will just have to make the right decision at those times as to where we would want to take the cost of capital from.
Jon Olsen: Yes, John, it’s Jon. The only thing I would add to that is, obviously, with the recent bond deal, we are sitting on a fairly sizable cash position. I think as we have talked about a few times in the past, about $600 million of that cash on the balance sheet is likely to be applied to paying off our 2018-4 securitization in November. But beyond that, the way we think about funding opportunity is on funding needs is really based on sort of what the opportunity set looks like at any given point in time. And what we try to do is be thoughtful when the opportunity presents itself and when it appears to be an attractive opportunity, we want to move, and we want to move quickly. I mean that’s one of the – one of the things that I think we are particularly good at is being opportunistic with respect to what the capital markets is offering. But clearly, we are not going to just go out there and raise capital willy-nilly if we don’t have an identified use of proceeds.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. So, the election is less than one week away. Just curious to hear your thoughts based on different outcomes, either at the Federal level or the State level. What do you think you will be doing differently come January, in spending? How you think you might be spending your time differently? And I guess the key is really more on the State level. Are there certain races that could impact your desirability to be in certain places that you are in now or not in now?
Dallas Tanner: Jamie, that is the fun question of the day. And I think everyone sitting around is trying to figure out what that all means at the Federal level. You nailed it with what you said there at the end, which is really state issues are the ones that we are hyper focused on all the time. Yes, look, there are some things on the ballot in California that we have been actively participating in making sure we advocate for the right processes that center around rent control and things like that. Those are clearly on our radar. Most of our other states don’t have anything too dramatic in front of them. Right now that causes us real concern. I think at the Federal level, while we spend a lot of time there, we talk about this. Most of the noise seems to come from the politics around the Federal level. The reality is that most of the risk is at the State and local municipalities. I would just add that like there has been some really good dialogue between the industry and I would say both parties at the Federal level around creating opportunities that induce private capital to create more supply. And that’s an area that we are obviously hyper-focused on. Scott talked about the 900 deliveries we had in the quarter. We have got somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 homes being built right now. We are continually leaning in with our balance sheet to create new product. We think it’s not only important, but it’s part of our growth story and our future as a company in bringing and constantly recycling new products into our portfolio and finding ways to meaningfully invest in these markets and communities. I think the NIM [ph] piece of it is the thing that local communities and states are going to have to manage. We need access to more supply. There is plenty of units in demand outside of even some of these near-term supply pressures. This stuff will get absorbed fairly quickly. So, your guess is as good as mine, and they will have a more interesting answer after the election.
Operator: This concludes or this completes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: We want to thank everyone on the call today for their support. We are grateful for all of our shareholders who continue to support Invitation Homes, and we look forward to seeing many of you at the NAREIT meetings later this next month. Thank you.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-25 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Invitation Homes Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Scott McLaughlin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Scott McLaughlin: Good morning, and welcome. I'm here today from Invitation Homes with Dallas Tanner, our Chief Executive Officer; Charles Young, President and Chief Operating Officer; John Olsen, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Eisen, Chief Investment Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session with our covering sell-side analysts. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourselves to 1 question and then requeue if you'd like to ask a follow-up question. During today's call, we may reference our second quarter 2024 earnings release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other nonhistorical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Except to the extent otherwise required by law, Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures in yesterday's earnings release. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dallas Tanner, our Chief Executive Officer.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. We're a little over halfway through the year, and we're pleased with the results we've posted to date. Our residents continue to stay longer with same-store average length of stay over 3 years. Our same-store portfolio remains effectively full with average occupancy of 97.5% during the second quarter. And we're pleased with our financial performance for the year-to-date through June with core FFO up 6.5%. It's an election year and housing is once again a focus on both sides of the aisle. We encourage elective officials and policymakers to have a complete understanding of the facts so that effective and long-lasting solutions to today's housing challenges can be enacted. Like many others, we follow the great work of John Burns and his team closely. I'd therefore like to start off this morning by reviewing some of their latest housing data. There are roughly 133 million households in the United States today. About 66% of those own their own home, a rate that is above the historical average during the last 6 years. And the other 34% lease something. Of those who lease, roughly 64% rent an apartment, while 31% lease a single-family home. This means there are about 14 million single-family rental homes across the country with our wholly owned portfolio, accounting for just 0.6% of total single-family rental supply. Against that backdrop, I'd like to focus on 3 topics during my prepared remarks today. First, we believe there has never been a more compelling time to lease a home than today. We've spoken a lot about the traditional reasons that millions of Americans choose to lease. These include flexibility and convenience as well as the desire for additional spaces, privacy and access to great schools. In addition to those, the past 2 years have opened an unprecedented affordability gap between homeownership and the cost of leasing. According to the Burns data, 2 years ago, it was just under $700 a month more expensive to buy than to lease on average in our markets. Today, the cost of homeownership is nearly $1,200 a month more expensive than it is to lease. High cost of homeownership has many causes. Chief among them according to most economists is the lack of new housing supply. Add that to the steady increases in homeowners' insurance and property taxes, among other costs of homeownership, and we believe the value proposition of leasing a home with us becomes even more attractive. Various experts estimate our nation's housing supply shortage is in the millions of units. So if we were to address these affordability challenges, it's imperative that the homebuilders continue to build more homes to meet that growing demand. That leads to my second point, which is that we're proud to be part of the solution by partnering with homebuilders to build new communities. We continue to expand our partnerships with some of the largest homebuilders in America as well as with regional homebuilders focused within our markets. Our partners understand that supported by our appetite for growth, they can build larger and more diverse communities and finish those communities faster than they otherwise might have alone. More homes delivered faster is a win for everyone including the 133 million households in America who are looking to lease or buy their next home. Our current pipeline includes nearly 2,700 new homes that we plan to make available for lease over the next few years in addition to around the 2,000 homes that we've already added since 2021. In total, that's nearly 5,000 newly constructed homes built or in our pipeline since we launched our build-to-rent efforts just 3 years ago. Furthermore, our attractive returns are leading the industry with current opportunities being underwritten at a 6% or better yield on cost, while mitigating most of the risks and costs of on-balance sheet development. My third and final point is that doing right by our residents means doing right by all of our stakeholders. We pioneered our professional service standards several years ago as a way to differentiate the worry-free lifestyle that we provide compared to the small landlords who make up the vast majority of this industry. In particular, we believe our 24/7 genuine care service and ProCare's offerings remain unrivaled. To highlight this point, through June year-to-date, our market teams turned and released more than 11,500 homes to new residents, nearly all of whom received a premove-in orientation as well as a 45-day post move-in visit. Both of these brand exclusive customer touch points are performed in person with the resident by our associates. We believe this level of service is feasible in part to our size and our scale and that our resident-centric approach helps drive our strong occupancy, customer retention and overall resident satisfaction. It's also why some of the largest and most respected portfolio owners have chosen recently our growing third-party management business to care for their homes and for their residents. We also leverage the size and the scale for the greater good of our communities. I'll call out 2 more recent examples. First is our support of the American Red Cross, and more specifically, their Sound the Alarm home fire and safety program. Our sponsorship helps the Red Cross install free smoke alarms and educate families on fire escape plans and home fire safety. Secondly, we continue to support local development and improvement of outdoor community spaces through our green spaces programming. This past spring, we funded 2 new brands: the PATCH Community Garden in Dania Beach, Florida, and the Wellspring Women's Center in Sacramento, California. As a long-term neighbor and a supporter of our communities, we take great pride in empowering our local associates to make an impact where they live and where they work. To wrap up, I'd like to thank our residents for their trust and their loyalty and thank all of our associates who work hard every day to earn that trust. We proudly stand behind the work that our company and our associates are doing to ensure our residents have a great experience with us. And we're honored to be a part of the solution to today's housing challenges. While just a fraction of 1% of the 14 million Americans who lease a home choose to do so with us, we believe we remain the premier choice where individuals and families can thrive. I'll now pass the call on to Charles Young, our President and Chief Operating Officer.
Charles Young: Thank you, Dallas. I'll begin by thanking our associates for another strong quarter. This has been the busiest time of the year for us, particularly for our leasing and maintenance teams, and I'm proud of the work they have done to provide exceptional service to our residents. I'll now walk you through our same-store operating results for the second quarter. Same-store NOI grew 3.8% year-over-year, led by an increase in same-store core revenues of 4.8%, an increase of same-store core expense of 7.1%. I'll discuss each of these a little further, starting with the 4.8% growth in core revenues. This is primarily driven by a 4.2% increase in average monthly rent, a 9.6% increase in other income and a 50 basis point year-over-year improvement in bad debt. The second quarter marks the fifth quarter in a row of sequential improvement in our same-store bad debt and we're pleased to see progress continuing across our markets. Next, I'll share more detail on our second quarter core expense growth of 7.1%. This was primarily due to a 10.3% increase in property tax expense, which Jon will discuss in more detail during his remarks as well as a significant year-over-year increase in repairs and maintenance expense due in part to weather conditions. These increases were partially offset by lower turnover, which drove a 10.8% decrease in turnover expense along with reductions in all of our other controllable expense line items, reflecting the hard work of our teams to control what we can control. I mentioned that weather impacted our R&M OpEx during the second quarter. It also had an outsized impact on R&M CapEx as well. As you probably heard and many of you felt, the summer season arrived early and hotter in most of our markets this year compared to last. We saw that come through during the second quarter with higher HVAC spend that impacted both R&M OpEx and R&M CapEx. Next, I'll review our same-store leasing results for the second quarter. Year-over-year renewal rent growth, which represents about 3/4 of our business, increased 5.6%, while new lease rates grew 3.6% year-over-year. Together, this brought blended rent growth to 5% year-over-year, which represents a healthy return to our historical pre-pandemic norm for the second quarter. What's notably different now compared to the pre-pandemic period is our same-store occupancy, which averaged 97.5% in the second quarter 2024 or approximately 140 basis points higher than our 3-year historical average for the second quarter prior to 2020. Looking ahead, as the summer leasing season comes to a close, we expect to see a normal degree of seasonality return to our portfolio. While we still have a week remaining here in July, we anticipate that new lease rate growth likely peaked in May and June, as it typically does, and that occupancy this month and next will reflect the usual summer move-outs and a normal seasonal curve. That being said, we expect to continue to lean in on occupancy, particularly as we move deeper into the second half of the year as occupancy is traditionally our most impactful core revenue growth driver. Once again, I'm really proud of our teams for the results they delivered. We've asked a lot of them this year as we've grown our third-party management business, elevated our high standards of genuine care and made additional improvements to the resident experience, and their performance has been outstanding. I'm especially grateful for their dedication to living our core values and doing what's right for our customers. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jon Olsen, our Chief Financial Officer.
Jon Olsen: Thanks, Charles. I'll begin by providing an update on our investment-grade rated balance sheet and the capital markets. At June 30, we had approximately $1.7 billion in available liquidity through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility. Unsecured debt comprised over 3/4 of our total indebtedness and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.3x at June 30. Virtually all of our debt was fixed rate or swapped to fixed rate and nearly 84% of our wholly owned homes were unencumbered at the end of the second quarter. As we previously announced on our last earnings call in April, Moody's upgraded our issuer and issue-level credit rating to BAA 2 from BAA 3 with a stable outlook. As we've discussed before, we have no debt reaching final maturity until 2026 when our IH 2018-4 securitization with a current balance of approximately $634 million reaches final maturity as does our 5-year credit facility, which is comprised of a $2.5 billion term loan along with an undrawn $1 billion revolver. While we have plenty of time remaining prior to 2026, we anticipate we'll address these maturities later this year. This is consistent with our historically proactive approach to managing our balance sheet and is also in consideration of various swap instruments that mature later this year and next. Specifically, we expect to repay the IH 2018-4 securitization later this year as planned, with cash that we had earmarked from our August 2023 bond issuance. We are also in discussions with our bank group regarding a recast of our 5-year credit facility, and we expect to be in a position to share further details on both prior to our next earnings call. Next, I'll review our second quarter and year-to-date financial results. For the second quarter, core FFO increased 7.3% to $0.47 per share, while AFFO increased 4.1% to $0.40 per share. Year-to-date, core FFO increased 6.5% to $0.94 per share and AFFO increased 5.4% to $0.81 per share. These year-to-date results mark a solid finish to the first half of the year, which included growing contributions from our third-party management business, a better than originally expected insurance renewal and some favorable early outcomes on property taxes in a few of our smaller tax markets. As outlined in last night's earnings release, we have maintained the midpoint of our full year same-store NOI growth guidance at 4.5% while moving the midpoint of our same-store revenue growth guidance down by 12.5 basis points, to 4.875%, and improving the midpoint of our same-store expense growth guidance by 50 basis points to 5.75%. In addition, we have raised the midpoint of our full year core FFO guidance by $0.01 to $1.87 per share. The full details of our updated [Technical Difficulty] are included in last night's earnings release. One area of our guidance where we think continued caution remains appropriate is property tax expense. As you know, property taxes represent our largest same-store expense line item by far with over half of the total being impacted by 2 states, Florida and Georgia. Georgia has provided us with limited information to date on assessed values while millage rates and final tax bills from both states aren't expected for a few more months. As we've previously discussed, we expect same-store property tax expense to remain elevated in the third quarter due to the under-accrual in the first 3 quarters of last year prior to a partial offset in the fourth quarter of this year. Our revised expectation for year-over-year property tax growth is 8% to 9.5%. As I mentioned earlier, we've received some favorable feedback from some of our smaller tax jurisdictions and in addition, some early signs from Georgia that are trending positively, but we believe it is prudent to remain cautious until better clarity exists later this year. In closing, we're pleased with what we've accomplished to date and are excited to maintain our momentum in the second half of the year. We remain committed to driving sustainable growth, serving as the premier choice in home leasing and continuing to create long-term value for our stockholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first questions comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS.
Michael Goldsmith: I believe in the prepared remarks, Charles, you said that you were leaning in on occupancy. Should we interpret that as you're being incrementally cautious on occupancy? Is that driving the reduction of the high end of the same-store revenue guidance and then along those lines, are you seeing or expecting potentially more move-outs from tenants looking to purchase homes?
Charles Young: Yes. This is Charles. Great question. If we kind of step back where we are, look at the quarter, Q2 was strong overall. 97.5% occupancy kind of reflects your question that we've been able to sustain occupancy throughout the year. You saw that early in the year as we were pushing. And as we got to occupancy, our blended rent growth rose every month for the last 5 months. So Q2 was strong overall. What we did see though was a little bit of moderation in a few markets that have been highflyers for us for the last several years in Phoenix, Tampa, a little bit of Orlando and Jacksonville. And as we saw that, I think that's what's reflecting in some of the guide that you're seeing. And those -- that kind of normal moderation is also a part of seasonality that's coming. So as we get into the summer here, you'll start to see that normal seasonality that happens where you'll get occupancy come down a little bit and then pop back up later in the year. And so as I talk about that, it's around trying to minimize how far it goes down and be ready for it to pop back up. In terms of the renewal side, look, there's a little bit more -- less loss to lease in the summer, and we have more going into the fall. And we went out in the mid-6s for the summer, and that's where you're seeing some of that moderation show up. But as you look forward into September and specifically October, we get back over 7 in our ask. And so we expect that the renewals will come back up and we'll get our occupancy back up. The business remains really strong. We're healthy overall. You look at the historical numbers, 97.5% at this time of year with a 5 blend is as strong as you've ever been outside of a pandemic season. So I'll turn it over to Jon to talk a little bit more about guidance.
Jon Olsen: Thanks, Charles. Look, we took what we thought was a conservative approach in reassessing guidance this quarter. In doing that, we fine-tuned both our revenue and expense guides. And we may have tried to put too fine a point on it, particularly with regard to the revenue revision. Ultimately, that was based on our desire to be as transparent as possible about what we're seeing in a couple of spots. So specifically, as Charles alluded to, Phoenix, Central Florida, where we've seen some moderation began around May and continued into June. So in particular, it seems as though there's a little bit of price fatigue setting in there and some supply sensitivities following what's been a fantastic run in those markets. We don't think there's anything to be alarmed about. The markets are still quite healthy, but maybe just not quite as strong as we had expected at the beginning of the year. All that said, the vast majority of our portfolio is firing on all cylinders. In particular, I'd call out Chicago, Southern California, Seattle, all of those had new lease rate growth above 5% in the second quarter. And on the renewal side, South Florida saw a 9.5% renewal growth. Atlanta was at 6.3% and over half of our other markets were in the 5%. So we feel really good about that. I think it's also worth noting that we do believe there's still some conservatism baked into the expense guide. In particular, we've talked about being cautious with respect to Florida and Georgia, Texas. And we'll know a lot more there in the next few months. So long story short, we're not seeing any kind of fundamental shift in the business, but we probably tried to be a bit too surgical in the revised revenue guide and we will own that.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein from Bank of America.
Josh Dennerlein: Maybe just a follow-up on some of the comments there. I appreciate the color on Phoenix and Jacksonville, maybe there's some price fatigue setting in there. Is there any kind of -- I think Phoenix has been a high supply market for SFR, just building in general. Is there any kind of like dynamic that's playing out from the supply front? Or is it just kind of like pricing has run and it's kind of at the upper limit of where people can afford it relative to incomes in those markets?
Charles Young: It's Charles again. Great question. Look, I think you hit on it in a few of these markets, specifically Phoenix, and we mentioned this in Vegas before, there is some build-to-rent coming on, which creates some short-term temporary supply shocks. And you couple that with the fatigue, I think that's what we're seeing here. Florida as well, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, these are markets where there's a lot of action happening on the build-to-rent side. And you couple that with the kind of moderation seasonality, a little bit of fatigue, we'll work through it. We've done that. We've seen these kind of ins and outs. And -- but we wanted to make sure that we were open and transparent about what we're seeing. So I think it's a little bit of both of that. And then as Jon mentioned, there's other markets that are really still humming along, not as much of that kind of fatigue. I think that's what happened in Chicago. Chicago never really had that run, and it's starting to catch up now. And then you also couple it, we're still pretty low on move out to purchase a home, but you can look across the markets and see that there's a little bit more inventory starting to come in some of the markets. And I think it creates a little bit more optionality. Again, where given the supply demand of single family in this country long term, we're in really great shape. You just get some of these kind of supply and fatigue items market by market, but that's why we're in multiple markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.
Steve Sakwa: I just wanted to maybe circle up with Dallas or Scott, just on the capital deployment, kind of what are your expectations going into the back half of the year? And where are you seeing more opportunities? And I know you talked about that 6% yield. How do you think that yield might trend kind of looking forward over the next 12 months?
Dallas Tanner: Steve, Dallas, I'll start, and then I'll hand it to Scott, who can add maybe a little bit more detail, real time. Look, we feel really good about our sort of guidance in terms of being in line with what we laid out at the beginning of the year, both from an acquisitions perspective and what we were generally seeing from a yield on cost point as well. I would say, and Scott can confirm this, that the majority of our relationships are expanding. We're seeing product in a lot of new areas. What's been sort of interesting has been maybe the regional operator wanting to lean in a little bit harder and figure out if there's ways to work together. It feels like yield on costs kind of on our numbers are in the 6 pluses. And we're looking at some creative ways to even maybe make that better over time. But it's -- we're certainly having more deal flow than I'd say we've seen even in the last couple of years, good opportunities.
Scott Eisen: And look, Steve, it's a good question. Thank you. We continue the same strategy that we started when I came on board about a year ago, which is to expand our relationships with both the national builders and the regional builders. They have been very open with us on their pipelines. We're obviously picking and choosing the locations and the communities that make the most sense for us. We're trying to find communities that are both proximate to where we have existing operations in existing homes and also communities that we think have the best in build demand. Look, we continue to underwrite new homes and communities every day in our dialogue with the builders. We've probably got another 1,000-plus homes in the backlog that we're trying to see whether they make sense for us and whether we can come close to getting those under contract or not. And we're looking within the same market that are the IH target markets, albeit maybe with also trying to see if we can do more in Nashville in particular, given the new presence we have there with the third-party management contracts. As far as yields and pricing, I'd say that they are consistent with sort of what the guidance is we've been giving to the Street for the last 6 months. And look, there were some markets where it's going to be a little lower, like a market like Denver where it's a higher price point and some markets where it's going to be a little higher on the cap rate and we're trying to get to the right blend across the company. But we continue to be pleased with the supply and dialogue we have with the builders. And again, it's we're picking and choosing what we like. Not everything we see from them makes sense. We pick the locations we like. We do a very detailed analysis on the demographics on the location, on the performance of our assets. We underwrite where competitive supply is, et cetera. We're trying to make the right decisions that are consistent with our operating strategy. But I'd say that the dialogue continues to be strong and significant, and we're trying to add more builders to our stable of partners every day.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe from Citigroup.
Eric Wolfe: I think at NAREIT, renewals were looking pretty strong for June and similar to May. I was just curious whether you saw any increased pushback from tenants in June, such that the take rate was maybe a little bit lower than normal versus where you're sending things out? And if you could also just share where you're achieving renewals for July and August versus where you're sending them, I think that would be a helpful context as well.
Charles Young: Yes. I'll start with July and August. We're not done. So we're not going to share the numbers in terms of July numbers. But going back to your original question, look, we were in the high 5s for all 5 months of the start of the year, 5.8, 5.7, 5.9. April actually came in at 6.0 and May was 5.9. What we did see, and this is part of what we're talking about here, there was a little bit of moderation in June. We ended up at 5.0 for a blend of 4.7. And so that's where that we just got cautious and we looked across the markets, and there were a few markets that, as we talked about, Phoenix in Central Florida that kind of dragged down a little bit. We do have some markets that are still high flying. We have South Florida, as Jon mentioned, is in the 9s and other markets are still there. So I think there's a couple of things. It's not always pushback. What -- I think we mentioned this at NAREIT as well, there's a bit of a thinner loss to lease in the summer because we've been pushing that time of year for years. And so as that portfolio turns over at that time of year, there's just not as much there. And as we're trying to stay focused on occupancy, we don't want to lean in too far. And -- but that loss to lease gets wider as we get into the end of the year. So you're going to see renewals start to come back up. And that's reflected in kind of what we went out for August in the mid-6s for renewal, September high 6s and October actually above 7. So you put all that together, you'll start to see the renewals come back. I think it's really more driven by loss of lease and seasonality of move-out season. And again, we're still going through some -- the lease compliance cleanup, and we're getting a little bit more move-outs now than we did in historical years, and we're trying to make sure we stay full. And so it's a balance as we optimize the revenue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc.
Austin Wurschmidt: I guess I'm still just trying to reconcile a few things a little bit of the why and the fact that turnover was down this quarter, occupancy was stable throughout the quarter. So what was it that you saw happening from a demand or notice to move-out perspective that led you to dial back the renewal rate growth 75 to 100 basis points in June relative to the increases achieved in April and May. And I'm also curious, do you think that the onboarding and sort of pricing strategy of the third-party management platform had any impact on the in-place portfolio?
Charles Young: This is Charles again. I'll take the last part again. There's -- really third parties had no impact here. This is really a kind of market situation. What we saw at NAREIT is May into June, we're still going strong. We saw some moderation in the second half of June. And as we looked at July, that seasonality started to show, we typically peak on blend in June, May. In July, August, you get the moderation that comes with the seasonality as people move out and you couple that with the markets and to the earlier question, there's a little bit more negotiation and we want to stay full, best we can. We are going to come down on occupancy for a few months and then pop back up. And as we do that, that's the balance that we saw. I just seen that in these few markets and at this time of the year, showed up a little earlier than we expected, and we wanted to make sure that we're being transparent on what we see.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern: I'm sure you're limited on what you can say, but can you give whatever color you can on this FTC inquiry. And then is this accrual, I guess, placeholder, or is this close to what you think the real liability might be?
Dallas Tanner: Thanks. This is Dallas. You hit it. I mean we can't say much because it's a pending legal matter. As we disclosed in the summer of '21, we received an inquiry from the FTC requesting information about how we conduct our business generally and specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, we've fully cooperated with the FTC. And as we've previously disclosed during the first quarter that we've begun some preliminary discussions with them about a potential resolution. Those discussions have continued since that time. They've been productive, and we certainly appreciate the dialogue with them to date. And as you know, GAAP requires a company to accrue for contingent liabilities when certain amounts or circumstances have been met, including consideration of a settlement offer that could be made in good faith. The amount we accrued as of the end of June reflects the amount that the company would consider paying to resolve the matter without any admission of liability and to avoid the inconvenience and expense of it continuing. And we do think a potential resolution of the matter will have -- the matter will have no material ongoing impact on our business. And that being said, presently, we can't say how it will proceed going forward or how it could ultimately be resolved.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo.
Jamie Feldman: Can you talk about the earnings impact from the incremental third-party homes added in the quarter? And what's in your guidance for the rest of the year?
Jon Olsen: Sure. Thanks. So recall at the outset of the year when we introduced guidance, we thought that there were about $0.02 of incremental AFFO contribution from the third-party business. The increase to the core FFO guide at the midpoint is sort of reflective of finding that there's a little bit more in it with the upcoming Upward America onboarding and a couple of other smaller things, but that's really what drove the midpoint increase on core FFO.
Operator: Our next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jefferies.
Linda Tsai: With your average stay at 3 years, do you think this is the peak given interest rates coming down? Or would you expect this to go higher by next year, given that John Burns comment about it being $1,200 more costly to buy versus rent?
Dallas Tanner: It's a great question. This is Dallas. Look, I think we've seen sequentially every quarter, our average length of stay continued to grow. And if you look at how the business was started, we started in the West Coast markets early on in 2012. Our West Coast markets are getting close to -- in some markets outside of California, almost 4 years. California is well into almost its fifth year of average length of stay. I wouldn't expect this to be a peak at all. As you look at the housing, call it, supply-demand imbalances, we would expect that as we bring on additional services, as we create the flexibility and efficiency of the scale of the platform that this leasing lifestyle outside of a cost differential is appealing to the masses in much greater scale. And I would just furthermore add that while this may be a tipping point or close to in terms of the bid-ask spread between ownership and cost of lease, we've operated in an environment where that differential was much less than it is today and continue to see that acceleration. So I think we think now it's sort of a minimum probably with the new customer that they're going to stay with us 3 years and well until fourth or fifth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets.
Juan Sanabria: Just a question. You mentioned higher R&M costs both on the OpEx and CapEx line. So just curious if you can give more details around that and how maybe your CapEx budget has changed. I noticed the AFFO or FAD guidance didn't change despite the change in core, so if you could remind us what we should be assuming for CapEx, that would be helpful.
Charles Young: Thank you. I'll start. This is Charles, and I'll give it to Jon. Look, as I mentioned, we saw the weather really heat up earlier than is typically seen for us and specifically relative to last year. The curve looks the same in terms of it gets hot in our markets around the start of the summer, but it started about a month early. And that curve of just how we budgeted comes due in the R&M line on both the OpEx and CapEx when you're dealing with HVACs, you can get into a little higher cost around repair and replacement and doing what's right by the resident, and make sure the house is cooled. So it's really just happening earlier and in many markets across the -- our portfolio from Florida to Phoenix, Texas, where we are today, it just got hotter earlier, and that's the impact there. I'll let Jon talk about how it impacts the guidance.
Jon Olsen: Thanks, Charles. Yes, Juan, I think you hit the nail on the head. So if you look at the revision to the core FFO guide and the fact that we did not move AFFO, it's sort of reflective of the fact that with the peak temperatures of summer kicking in a little bit earlier, CapEx has been running hot. So in terms of the year-over-year increases there, they're sizable on both the expense and capital side, and so given where we are relative to where we expected to be, we just weren't in a position yet to make a move on the AFFO front. The teams are very focused on cost controls. Typically, what we see is when HVAC season starts, is you see a big pickup in work order volume as people start turning those systems on and discovering what sort of repairs or other maintenance might be required. And then once we've gotten through that, you see the volume of work orders sort of dissipate on the back end. The shape of that curve this year looks really familiar and very comparable to last year. It's been just shifted forward a little bit. So we're going to continue to watch that with respect to CapEx and the AFFO guide and more to come on that probably next quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jesse Lederman of Zelman & Associates.
Jesse Lederman: Nice job in the quarter. A quick one on acquisition guidance. So if I take your current spending year-to-date and incorporate roughly 700 homes you expect to be delivered from homebuilders in the second half of the year and normalize for a consistent number of existing homes that you've acquired the last couple of quarters, it looks like you'd still need to purchase about 800 homes beyond that to get to the midpoint of the $800 million. So I just wanted to ask currently, what do you view as the most likely source of these additional homes between additional deliveries from homebuilders, the existing home market, which seems to maybe have loosened up or a portfolio acquisition.
Scott Eisen: Yes, great question. This is Scott. Thanks. Look, in terms of our acquisition backlog and where we're focused, we continue to negotiate directly with the national and regional builders on buying the partial and full communities from them. So part of the incremental acquisitions that we would expect to get under contract between now and year-end is just continuing buying directly from the homebuilders. We are also looking at some full community acquisitions. There are sponsors out there that have developed full communities and are ready to monetize and exit them that are either partially or fully stabilized. And there are -- we obviously look at various of these communities when they come to market. And there are a few of them out there that we're taking a hard look at. And to the extent we could find something that makes sense for us and is it the right yield, we could supplement buying directly from the homebuilders by buying some full communities from some specific BTR developers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: Charles, I want to go back to something you mentioned earlier about the expectation for renewal pricing to pick up into the fourth quarter, obviously, we're going through a bit of seasonality here, but an expectation for that to rebound. Just looking back the last couple of years, that hasn't really been the case. I know COVID, obviously, the last couple of years impacted the numbers but even before COVID. So I guess I'm curious your thoughts are what gives you the confidence that you will see that recovery indeed into the fourth quarter?
Charles Young: Thanks, Haendel. Yes, I think you called it out. Coming off of COVID, there was no seasonality. And the numbers, the supply/demand, what was going on with lease compliance and all that. The renewals were just high for a few years, and you didn't get the kind of up and down that we're talking or seeing in the normal seasonal curve that we're seeing this year. There's just not as much loss to lease in the summer because historically, that portfolio, we have a long length of stay, and we renew and we've been pushing and there's just not as much to capture and you balance that with trying to stay occupied, you don't see it. But what we do see is that you can look at the numbers, there's a lot more loss to lease as we go into the fall. And so -- I we're back to that normal seasonal curve. And we're past that the pandemic period that expect and already starting to see what the ask of October in the 7s coming up from the mid-6s that we're going to start to see that. So time will tell what it looks like, but this is kind of the normal historical that we've seen, and it's math in terms of the loss to lease and what we see in the portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Tricarico from Scotia Bank.
Daniel Tricarico: Charles or Jon, could you put some numbers around the change in growth expectations for those Florida, Phoenix and Vegas markets this year?
Charles Young: I don't know if we typically give specific by market. I'm speaking for Jon here a little bit. We typically are kind of give what we think our blend will be for the year. And we had -- I personally had expectations watching how Florida had performed late last year and early this year that we might keep some of that momentum going. The reality is, as we talked about, just a bit of a moderation in return to seasonality, and it happened a little earlier than we expected. And so I think that's what's reflecting in our adjustment to the guide and just being thoughtful around what we're seeing in those markets. Again, a little bit more negotiation, a little bit of short-term supply based on build-to-rent. Same thing with Phoenix. We've seen that for a little while. It's starting to come back. But this is some of the things that you see on markets that have been flying high for a while. There is a little bit of moderation here, and we'll get back to kind of equilibrium over time.
Jon Olsen: Yes. I think the only thing I would add to that is to reiterate that we probably tried to get a little bit too surgical in terms of referencing what we saw in Phoenix and some of the non -- the Florida markets other than South Florida. But I think the reality is we felt comfortable that overall growth remains robust. We feel really comfortable with where the business is. As Charles mentioned, we see that loss to lease opens back up for us here in the next couple of months. But we want to be really thoughtful about striking a balance between rate and occupancy because as Charles said, occupancy is much more impactful and ultimately, our guide is to core revenue growth. And that is what we want to optimize and the levers we have to pull are the trade-off between rate and occupancy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley.
Adam Kramer: Just on the property taxes. Wondering which kind of the markets that came in below expectations. I think you mentioned some of the kind of non-Florida, Georgia markets. Just wondering if you could call out the specific market that came in below expectations.
Jon Olsen: Yes, sure. Great question, Adam. In Washington State and Minnesota, we had good guides in the first quarter. So the revision to the top end of that property tax guidance range is entirely attributable to actual good guides that we recorded in the first half. So just to be crystal clear, our underlying assumptions for property tax expense growth outside of those markets are unchanged, right? So we haven't touched up our Florida or Georgia assumptions. As I've referenced in my prepared remarks, the Georgia values that we are getting back and have gotten back have shown that assessed values are coming in below what we've incorporated in our assumptions. Obviously, we don't have millage rates or final tax bills yet. So that's not something that we're going to take to the bank. But when I said that there were some signs that we thought supported cautious optimism, that's what they are.
Operator: Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya from Deutsche Bank.
Omotayo Okusanya: With some of the incremental supply you're highlighting in markets like Florida, could you just talk a little bit about who's doing that building? How much of it is -- how much is actually coming online and how quickly one can expect that to be absorbed in these markets?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. I think I can't give you exactly a Florida-specific answer on absorption and new home starts in a succinct answer. But I think Scott and I would both agree, we're out in the market. We are seeing both build-to-rent operators in regional, and I'd even add national homebuilders that are much more willing to deal on pending pipeline. And some of that comes from a natural slowdown of the homebuyers with mortgage rates in the 7s or in the low 7s. And also there are some BTR operators that are -- we've seen it, Scott, even in some of our conversations where they're thinking about where they are kind of midway through a project and/or call it, entitlements delivery and rethinking things. And so there's definitely some new supply where we've been able to sort of cherry pick. It's hard to tell you how much of that is absorption. But like to re-echo or to reemphasize what Charles and Jon has said, you've certainly seen some supply sensitivity in Phoenix, Tampa and Orlando. Some of that's driven by average listings, some of it's driven by new product coming into the marketplace.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anne Ken from Green Street.
Unidentified Analyst: Do you have any thoughts on whether the lower turnover recently is signifying a larger trend going forward? And if so, how should we look at quantifying the impact to OpEx and CapEx from the lower turn?
Charles Young: I can start on the turn kind of trends here. If I -- prior to last year as we were really going through the bad debt lease compliance cleanup, we've been lowering turnover year-over-year. It got kind of abnormally low during the pandemic, just given the dynamics. But last year, it went up. And a lot of that was as we were trying to work through the lease compliance. We're still working through some of that, especially in some of our bigger markets, Atlanta, SoCal's made some good moves. We're still dealing with Carolina, Chicago a bit. And so from a historical perspective, it's still a little higher than it might have been. But relative to last year, where we -- especially in the second half of the year, we talked about why we pushed so hard on occupancy because we had a big turnover spike as we were cleaning up there. And so what you're seeing this year is kind of returning back to that kind of normal trend as we work through a little bit of that cleanup. How it balances out? We still have some cleanup in markets like Atlanta and a few others. So time will tell. But so far, it's trended nicely. And we talked a little bit here about the R&M expense, again, driven by weather. But as you look at our turn costs and other parts, those have come in really well, and that's mostly because we are starting to see that trend down. Hard to predict kind of where -- predict where it ends up. But I like our trend and being in that low 20s is a really healthy place. And it's part of what's driving our occupancy as well as coupling it with good days to re-resident, the teams are really executing well. So the things that we're controlling that we can control. Proud of the teams and how they're behaving. You want to add something, Jon?
Jon Olsen: No, I think the only observation I would share, Anne, and I think it's a good question, is that the lease compliance move out that we continue to see while we're seeing some moderation in the quantum of those. It's still a pretty good number, right? So about 17.5% of move-outs in the second quarter were sort of lease compliance backlog cleanup. That was down about 200 basis points from the first quarter, and it's about 100 basis points lower than what our average has been over the last 5. So we're seeing very reasonable turnover inclusive of some ongoing cleanup of the COVID hangover. And I would say the turn cost being down year-over-year, taking into consideration that we did have still a relatively sizable number of those lease compliance move-outs and the fact that those are typically in the neighborhood of 50% more costly than a standard turn. If we put it all together, we feel quite good about controlling the things that are within our control, as Charles said.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jade Ramani from KBW.
Jason Sabshon: This is Jason Sabshon on for Jade. My question is, how much do rates need to come down for acquisitions to really accelerate?
Scott Eisen: I think from our -- this is Scott. Thanks, great question. I think from our perspective, look, we have a certain hurdle rate that we set for our acquisitions and what we're trying to achieve. And as we've said to the market, we're in the market today achieving, especially with our builder deals, deals in the 6-plus percent range. As markets move and as interest rates move, we will evaluate what we think our cost of capital is and what we think we're prepared to pay for transactions in the market. It's hard for me to sit here and tell you exactly how much we're going to move our acquisition cap rates for every basis point move in treasuries. But obviously, we look at our weighted average cost of capital, we look at where we see opportunity in the market, whether it's buying from builders, buying portfolios or buying stabilized assets, and we will pivot accordingly as the market moves. But can't sit here and tell you, prescriptively exactly how much cap rates are going to move based upon interest rates.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo.
Jamie Feldman: I just want to clarify because, Jon, you've now said a couple of times, you think you may have taken too surgical view of this in your revised guidance or too surgical a cut. Are you suggesting maybe you're better off not revising guidance? I just -- I've had a couple of people ping me on this, and I just want to -- I think everyone wants to understand exactly what you mean by that. I think you said too surgical and you'll have to own it.
Jon Olsen: Yes. Well, I think that we were a bit surprised by the reaction candidly. And I think we were maybe too mechanical in how we approached the puts and takes that we saw based on what we learned in the first half of the year. And so I think it's a little bit of a mea culpa because we weren't trying to launch 1,000 ships and give people the sense that we see underlying weakness in our business because we don't. What we were trying to do is sort of acknowledge that, hey, we sort of alluded to this at NAREIT over the course of the balance of June, we saw that, that was a trend that was continuing, and that was moderation in certain of the markets that Charles referenced based on maybe a little bit of price fatigue on the part of the customer and in the interest of trying to be transparent, that was what was reflected in the guide.
Operator: Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya from Deutsche Bank.
Omotayo Okusanya: The pipeline, you talked about the 2,700 homes, which I think includes the 1,000 homes you just announced, how quickly do you expect that to be delivered?
Scott Eisen: Great question. Thank you. The way that these builder pipelines work is when we get something under contract, let's say, we're buying 150 homes in a community from a builder. The builders deliver those homes to us, let's say, 10 homes a month within any given community. So when we talk about our backlog, we're obviously giving visibility to a pipeline that, frankly, could get -- is getting delivered over the next 8 quarters or so. And so in our supplemental, we obviously disclosed that we have a backlog here of, call it, 2,700 homes in the pipeline, we've been very specific that we expect 691 of those homes to be delivered in the second half of this year and then the balance is what gets delivered over time. But again, each time we get a community under contract, there is a forward delivery schedule and the builders on average tend to deliver somewhere between 8 and 10 homes a month. And so that's why when you look at that pipeline, that's why you see a certain percentage of it is second half and a certain half percentage of it is in 2015. So we don't get 150 homes delivered to us all at once, but it gets spread over time. And obviously, that from a leasing perspective, also makes it a little more efficient for us. So instead of having a community that's 100% vacant for 150 homes, we get 10 homes a month. And so we can sort of balance our leasing of those homes as they get delivered. And so that's the right way to think about that pipeline, and that's why we have that disclosure in our supplemental the way we do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe from Citigroup.
Eric Wolfe: Apologies, line dropped out for a second. So if you've already answered this, my apologies. But I was just curious what's sort of embedded in your guide for the back half of the year for blended spreads. You did, I think, 4.7% in the first half. So I was just curious what would be in the guide for the second half of the year and sort of if you could give a little bit of building blocks to how you're going to get there?
Jon Olsen: Yes. It's a good question, Eric. I mean, recall that our guidance is around core revenue growth, but we did articulate that we thought that blended rent growth would be high 4s, low 5s for the balance of the full year. As you know, we are 4.7 through the first half, the path forward from here is going to be a story of balancing rate and occupancy. And so we're going to take as much rate as we can when we can take it and where we can take it, but we're going to be conscious of wanting to stay full. So I think as I think about the leverage we have available to pull in order to maximize revenue and NOI, we react to the signals we see in the market. We try to lean in and be aggressive where we can. But at the same time, if we need to give a little bit to stay full and keep driving revenue and NOI contribution, that's what we'll do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc.
Austin Wurschmidt: I appreciate you taking the follow-up as well as just kind of the thought around being transparent and just confidence in the underlying business. I guess it's just not providing a July update maybe send a little bit of a different message and so trying to understand what gives you the confidence around renewal rate growth reaccelerating during what is the seasonally slower part of the year. You highlighted, I think, mid-6% to 7% plus from August to October. So maybe just help us understand what you expect to achieve relative to that asking rate because there has been some giveback on the ask versus what was achieved here within recent months.
Charles Young: Yes, this is Charles. Look, there's always a little bit of a spread between what we ask and what we pull in, and it can be 100 basis points, could be 200 basis points. It goes back and forth. We've never -- if we're in a month and we're only in the 25th, we've never given exact numbers on kind of where we are, there's still time left. But what I can say is, as we looked at kind of the June, May to June, we're seeing similar trends. We kind of peaked out, as I talked about on the new lease side in May and June at 3.8, 3.7. July is going to moderate slightly as we get into seasonality on the new lease side. Renewals aren't far off from -- from where we are in June, maybe down a little bit like we talked about because of the loss of lease and the spread, but we expect that those renewals will come up over time. So as we talked about, again, we went into ending the quarter at 97.5%, 5% blend. We're going in the seasonality, still seeing good demand. We have a few markets that are softening. We have some markets that are really strong. We talked about Chicago, we talked about SoCal, what we're seeing in Sou Flo. Even Atlanta has really strong kind of rate growth at this point in the kind of top half of where we are. So look, there is a -- we're in a position that we want to go into the summer like this. Coming in at 97.5%, we'll find that kind of normal moderation of occupancy over a couple of months, and everything will kind of pop back up and we think the renewals that are 2/3 of what we do will start to come back. So I like the position that we're in. We saw a little bit of moderation and seasonality show up a little earlier than we expected. And other than that, things are still robust. Demand is there. We're getting the leads, and we'll keep pushing and driving towards revenue.
Operator: This completes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: We appreciate all the support. Look forward to seeing people at the call conferences. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. You may disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Invitation Homes First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  
 At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Scott McLaughlin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Scott McLaughlin: Good morning and welcome. I'm here today from Invitation Homes with Dallas Tanner, Chief Executive Officer; Charles Young, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jon Olsen, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Eisen, Chief Investment Officer.  
 Following our prepared remarks, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session with our covering sell-side analysts. [Operator Instructions]
 During today's call, we may reference our First Quarter 2024 Earnings Release & Supplemental Information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com.  
 Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other nonhistorical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated. 
 We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Except to the extent otherwise required by law, Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.  
 We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, in yesterday's earnings release.  
 I'll now turn the call over to Dallas Tanner, our Chief Executive Officer. 
Dallas Tanner: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our teams kicked off 2024 with a great start to the year. In particular, our first quarter results reflect high same-store average occupancy, accelerating same-store rent growth and strong same-store core revenue and NOI growth. We believe this puts us in a great position as we begin our peak leasing season.  
 That being said, operating and leasing success is only one aspect of our anticipated growth this year. When we spoke to you in February, we told you that our 14,000-home property and asset management agreement with Starwood was just the beginning. Less than 3 months later, we've added over 7,000 more homes onto our management platform, including through last night's announcement of our joint venture with Quarterra, Centerbridge and other high-quality investors, as well as our agreement with Nuveen, that we signed in March. We are honored to work with each of these respective partners who highly value our coast-to-coast SFR management expertise and best-in-class operating and management capabilities.  
 We believe this is just the beginning of the journey to grow our professional management and services business, which, as a reminder, offers many benefits to Invitation Homes. 
 First, we earn attractive property and asset management fees that are commensurate with our unmatched expertise and scale. Second, we're able to grow earnings in a capital-light manner, including through the opportunity to potentially acquire these homes at a later date. Third, we develop deeper insight via the operational data we collect, which help us to better operate our own homes and markets. And fourth, we can further leverage the combined power of scale and density by spreading our costs across a larger number of homes, thereby improving our margins. 
 We believe our partners and residents also benefit from choosing Invitation Homes as their manager. In addition to getting direct access to our operating, leasing and asset management expertise, our partners can realize potential savings from utilizing our vast vendor network, our staffing optimization and our advantageous pricing agreements. 
 Residents in turn receive our signature Genuine Care and ProCare services, along with the value-add amenities we offer, including, for example, our Internet bundle that we buy in bulk in several of our markets and provide to residents at a discount to retail pricing. 
 Another area of growth for us remains our new product pipeline. We announced last month that we added several large homebuilders to our growing list of relationships, including D.R. Horton, Meritage Homes and Dream Finders Homes. We're under contract with them to build approximately 500 new homes primarily in Charlotte, Jacksonville and Nashville, with deliveries expected to start later this year. Underwritten cap rates on these acquisitions are in line with our previously stated targets of roughly a 6% yield on cost, which I will remind you is a return that's effectively free of any development risk to us today.  
 Given the dynamic environment we've seen in the last couple of years and the volatility in land pricing, cost of materials and interest and cap rates, our contracts are designed to protect us from the risks inherent with on-balance sheet development while achieving what we believe are a far superior risk-adjusted total return. We're proud of the growth we delivered through partnering with the best and largest homebuilders in the country, while also helping to create much needed new housing supply in the communities we serve.  
 To wrap up, we're pleased with how our teams have started off this year. I extend my thanks to all of our associates for their hard work in seamlessly bringing thousands of new homes onto our platform, while at the same time, continuing to deliver outstanding operating and leasing results. 
 As we look ahead, we're excited by our ability to sustain this momentum as we leverage our strategic approach and operational excellence to drive continued growth for our stakeholders through the remainder of the year.  
 With that, I'll pass the call onto Charles Young, our President and Chief Operating Officer. 
Charles Young: Thank you, Dallas. Our associates really shined during the first quarter, delivering great results and preparing the business for our peak leasing and maintenance season, all while bringing 14,000 third-party managed homes into our operations. 
 During the first quarter, we maintained high occupancy, accelerated lease rent growth and continue to see our customers stay longer with us. We believe this is all part of a simple formula to sustainable NOI growth throughout the year.  
 Now let's cover our first quarter same-store operating results in more detail. Fundamentals remain strong and thanks to the great performance of our teams, we grew same-store NOI by 4.7% in the first quarter. Same-store core revenues grew 5.6% year-over-year, driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 4.6%, an 80-basis point year-over-year improvement in bad debt and a 15.9% increase in other income, primarily related to our value-add offerings.  
 Same-store core operating expenses in the first quarter increased 7.4% year-over-year. This was the result of an 11.8% increase in fixed expenses and a 0.5% decrease in controllable costs. For fixed expenses, the largest driver of the increase was property taxes. As we anticipated and previously discussed, due to the under accrual of property taxes in the first 3 quarters of last year, we expect property tax expense growth to be higher during the first 3 quarters of this year before normalizing in the fourth quarter.  
 Meanwhile, on the controllable side of expenses, we're pleased to see cost of goods continue to moderate as well as a strong effort by our teams to control costs. This is reflected in our 0.5% reduction in controllable expenses year-over-year as well as our 4.6% reduction in controllable costs from the fourth quarter of 2023 to first quarter 2024. 
 Of particular note, the first quarter same-store turnover rate of 5.2% was flat with last year's first quarter results. Yet turnover expense was down 2.4% year-over-year. This is due in part to the progress we've made in working through our lease compliance backlog. 
 In that regard, it's great to see more of our markets returning to pre-pandemic normal levels of bad debt. As a reminder, normal for us is approximately 40 to 60 basis points of bad debt as a percentage of gross rental revenues, which has historically been industry-leading among our SFR peers. 
 Looking ahead, while we still have some work to do in a few of our markets, we remain encouraged by the continued high quality of our new residents, whose average household income over the last 12 months is now approximately $158,000 a year, bringing our average income-to-rent ratio to 5.6x.  
 Now let's cover our same-store leasing trends in the first quarter. Renewals grew 5.8% and new leases increased 0.8% year-over-year. This drove blended rent growth to 4.4%. Average occupancy in the first quarter remained strong at 97.6%. 
 Our preliminary April 2024 results show our peak leasing season has started off well. Renewal rent growth accelerated to 6%, while new lease rate growth accelerated to 3.1%, delivering blended rent growth of 5.2% in April. Average occupancy generally held steady at 97.5%. 
 With occupancy in a strong position and fundamentals remaining in our favor, we believe we're in great shape to capture the demand we're seeing in our markets and continue the great momentum our teams have built. I'd like to thank them again for their focus on resident service and operational excellence, along with their diligent efforts as we plan and prepare for future growth.  
 With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jon Olsen, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Jonathan Olsen: Thanks, Charles, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our financial results for the first quarter 2024, followed by an update on our investment-grade rated balance sheet before opening the line for questions.  
 I'll start with our first quarter 2024 financial results. Core FFO increased 5.7% year-over-year to $0.47 per share, primarily due to an increase in NOI. These results also reflect the first quarter of contribution from the 14,000 home portfolio we started managing in mid-January. 
 The fees we earned were partially offset by investments we made in resources and support to help prepare for anticipated future growth. These items are included on our income statement under management fee revenues and property management expense, respectively. 
 Meanwhile, higher core FFO drove our 6.8% year-over-year increase in AFFO to $0.41 per share. We're pleased with these results and appreciate the considerable efforts of our associates to help us begin the year strong.  
 Turning now to our investment-grade rated balance sheet. We had over $1.7 billion in available liquidity at the end of the first quarter through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.4x at March 31, 2024, down slightly from 5.5x as of December 31 and just below our 5.5x to 6x targeted range. 
 We have no debt reaching final maturity until 2026. In addition, 99.5% of our total debt is fixed rate or swapped to fixed rate and over 76% of our total debt is unsecured.  
 This week, we received further validation of the strength of our balance sheet. Specifically, I'm referring to our announcement that Moody's recently upgraded the company to Baa2 from Baa3, joining both S&P and Fitch with BBB flat investment-grade ratings. Looking forward, we believe this ratings upgrade further enhances our positioning for when compelling opportunities arise.  
 In summary, we believe Invitation Homes is at the beginning of a new phase of our business in which exciting opportunities could become more actionable and the quality of our balance sheet, systems and talent are the best they've ever been. All of this puts us on a path from which we believe we can continue to deliver outsized results for our stockholders and the best possible experience for our residents. 
 That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. 
Michael Goldsmith: In the past, you've talked about starting to push rate around the Super Bowl, so mid-February. So it seems like this year, it kind of maybe took a step back -- maybe these spreads kind of took a step back in March, before your recent comment that they accelerated in April. So just trying to get a sense of kind of the sequential trajectory of the new lease rent trends during the quarter and into April? And if there was any factors that was influencing maybe some of the choppiness, which has resulted in where it is, now it seems kind of on pace. 
Charles Young: Sure. This is Charles. Appreciate the question. Look, we've seen a really healthy acceleration through the quarter. As we talked about last quarter, we had solved for occupancy coming out of last year as we had some lease compliance turnover that spiked. We did exactly what we said we were going to do. We got occupancy up from 97.1% to 97.6% for the quarter, which is really healthy. And then we started pushing rates in January in anticipation, as you're talking about, for February to jump. So from January to February, we went up over 300 basis points, continued to push into March to the high 2s and looking at April here, in the high 3s. That's all new lease rent growth. The blend has also accelerated the last 3, 4 months as we anticipated. 
 What's really great though is we're still 97.5% occupied and we're seeing further acceleration into May. So we set ourselves up really nicely to capture the demand that comes this time of year in peak season. So really haven't seen any kind of dislocation from what is the typical seasonality that we expected. And if there was anything, it was just us setting ourself up to take advantage of the demand that's in front of us by getting occupied. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe from Citi. 
Eric Wolfe: I know you get asked this question a lot but The Wall Street Journal article the other day brought up regulatory risk again and then generated some more questions. So I was just curious from your perspective, what you're advocating for that you think would help the housing affordability issues. If it's not limits on ownership or rent control, what do you think would improve housing affordability and what role are you going to play in that? 
Dallas Tanner: Yes, really appreciate the question. Clearly, the cost of housing in the country is a bit high generally. And it keeps getting worse, particularly due to higher mortgage rates and lack of supply. Now what we can do is our best to encourage that new supply coming into the market, which is why we're working with so many of our homebuilder partners, helping them start large new communities that often include a mix of for sale and for lease housing. And you have to remember, there's 47 million households in the U.S. that rent something somewhere. It's about 1/3 of the country. And it's been that way really for decades. 
 And so it's also important to remember that -- we learn this from our residents, they tell us time and time again that they want choice and flexibility of leasing a home. And it's at a significantly lower cost than owning it. 
 If you look at our West Coast markets today, it's upwards of almost $2,000 a month cheaper to lease a home in markets like Seattle or in Southern California than it would be to own. So the -- John Burns covers a lot of this data really well. But attempts to restrict companies like ours for being a need or a desired option for consumers seems sort of to be misguided. It's also counterproductive. I think that's why, as noted in that article that you mentioned, none of the anti-leasing and anti-professional management bills actually get very far to date at both national and state levels. 
 So regardless of the narrative that kind of it's a populous thing to try to point fingers at companies that are providing housing solutions, we're going to continue to work with our trade associations. We work at the state and local levels very effectively. And then candidly, you've seen some really positive legislation go through in the states that are much more proactive in this housing debate and trying to create access for private capital to come into the housing market and to provide additional dwelling units. 
 So that's our goal, is to be part of that narrative, which would be to bring new supply into the market over and over and over. And we're not going to stop. And as we've announced in our script, we're working with some of the best and brightest in the country doing that. 
Operator: Our next question next comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. 
Brad Heffern: Jon, is there any context that you can give for the incremental contribution from the new third-party management agreements to earnings? I know you're obviously not changing the guidance but just some sort of scale on that would be great. 
Jonathan Olsen: Sure. So I think it's important to note that, as you point out, we had guided to $0.02 of earnings contribution from third-party management. Included in that guide were both the Starwood and the Nuveen agreements. The Upward America agreement that we announced yesterday is not in there. I think it's also important to note, however, that only 1 of those 3 portfolios has been onboarded at this stage, just the Starwood portfolio. The Nuveen portfolio is scheduled to be onboarded in mid-May and then Upward America, sometime in the third quarter. 
 So I think as we approach those onboarding dates, we get better and better visibility into the operating metrics specific to those portfolios of homes and we'll have better insight into what we think the potential is. So I think time will tell. We're still very early on. But as we approach those onboarding dates and we get more time under our belt actually managing those portfolios, we'll see if there's some upside to what we've guided thus far. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. 
Steve Sakwa: Charles, I don't know if you had touched on the renewal increases that had maybe gone out for kind of the April, May, June and maybe even July period. So any commentary around that would be great. 
Charles Young: Yes. I had mentioned it. We went out for May and June in the mid-7s, which was similar, maybe just slightly lower from what we did with April and we ended up April at 6.0%, which was accelerating from all of Q1. So still healthy as you look back on any historical means. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Just have a question related to transaction activity. And I was hoping you could provide some additional comments around the more significant entrance into Nashville; whether or not you're looking at other new markets to enter; and then just more broadly, about activity in the transaction market and whether you think there's enough in the pipeline to kind of hit that full year acquisition guidance? 
Dallas Tanner: Yes. I'll -- this is Dallas. I'll start and then I'll ask Scott to add anything that he'd like to it. But first and foremost, we went back into Nashville as part of a transaction last summer, that allowed us to get a significant amount of more scale in that marketplace. I think Scott can give you more color on the ground with what we're seeing real time in terms of the opportunities. I think we feel very good about our guidance ranges. No change there. 
 And remember, with the new construction that we're building, it's lumpy. It comes in at different times of the year. And we certainly are looking at some M&A and having discussions. And I think you've seen we've been extremely active in the last 6 months with the 20,000 units that we brought on. 
 One thing I just want to highlight and then I'll hand it over to Scott is, I think what's really exciting about the 3PM business for us, is that if you look at the first 3 transactions we've done, they've all been very different in nature. 
 One is a pure-play third-party management with maybe an option for a takeout down the road. The other was us actually acquiring management contracts and thinking about further expansion of that relationship with that particular capital partner. And then the last situation, we bought into a new home construction portfolio with both professional capital and a professional homebuilder. And so in participating in the equity stack, so to speak, it gives us obviously aligned incentives but also a clear view on how to grow that business and that particular portfolio over some period of time. 
 Scott, do you want to maybe give a little bit more color on what we're seeing and just sort of from a scale perspective? 
Scott Eisen: Sure. And just to address your questions about markets. I mean Nashville is a good example where we're adding new homes in that market, both through third-party management agreements and also some communities that we are buying as well. And so that's just an example of something that we're trying to take the market where we were undersized before but clearly, we're getting some good scale in the near run and we hope to grow there more over time. We have other markets that we're also eyeing that we're going to get exposed to through the third-party management contacts and -- contracts and we're hoping to see more like in Austin and San Antonio, for example, as markets. 
 In addition, one thing that I would add is that we continue to expand our dialogue with the homebuilders. Obviously, we've done a lot historically with Pulte and Lennar, but we're also adding more national and midsize builder relationships to the table here. We're doing some deals with Horton and we're doing some deals with Meritage. We've got some other midsize builders that we're adding to the stable. We continue to add more of the build-for-rent product where we're helping create supply, as Dallas talked about earlier, and working with the homebuilders to give them confidence to start new communities and know that we can buy some of the homes and have some of those homes be purchased by retail customers. So we continue to do our part to create more supply and obviously, it's adding to our acquisition backlog and pipeline. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. 
Juan Sanabria: Just sticking on the 3PM theme. Just curious about how you think about the overall size of the opportunity. Is there any basic math you could share on what the accretion would be if you add, let's say, 10,000 homes or just whatever metric or -- you'd like to talk to? 
 And just going back to the previous question about regulation, we've obviously seen some negative headlines for the industry about collusion or whatever on pricing. Is there any concern for you guys that as you take on more responsibility that -- and you manage third-party assets and it's all in 1 system, that you could be -- come under threats there or risks around pricing for the industry? 
Dallas Tanner: Juan, thanks for your questions. I'm going to try to hit on in a few different ways. And then I would say, Jon, feel free to add anything on the economics. Look, I think, and we talk about this over and over and over, you have to remember the size and scale of the U.S. housing footprint. We have about 147 million households that own or lease something in the U.S. today. I mentioned earlier, 47 million of those lease. 
 If you look at the single-family rental dynamic in the U.S., there's somewhere between, call it, 15 million-ish homes that are for lease. Roughly about 3% of those are probably operated by what we call professional capital that might total maybe 500,000 units. And those are spread amongst at least 60 different companies that I'm aware of. 
 So the data actually on the other 97% of single-family rentals that are out there, is sort of in a universe that nobody has access to that information. So no, I think it's actually the opposite one. 
 As a company, we have our own data. We look at all the public information on the listing data and that has informed our thinking around rents and pricing of homes and things like that for the last decade, just publicly available information. 
 Second, in terms of the sizing of what we're calling 3PM internally but really, it's the additional scale we can bring on to the platform by being a service provider for other owners of single-family rental. It's still early. And like I mentioned, there's about 500,000 units that we can identify as being sort of professionally owned, out of the 15 million. So it's about plus or minus 3% of that. 
 We would love to stay active and keep growing our business. I will tell you, you think about like the strength of the platform, adding 20,000 units over a 6- or 9-month period is going to give us tremendous amount of horsepower even in our own portfolio. You start to think about RFPs that we have out, where we're working on getting more efficient with our own costs and our spend. That's going to give us additional capacity there to lean in and to give our vendors more work but at the same time, try to get better pricing for our customers. And so we're really excited about what that means. 
 We see the landscape currently being tens of thousands or maybe 100,000-plus units. But we expect the SFR industry to keep growing. And we expect that over time and maybe the next decade, that 97% could come in a little bit at -- much like you've seen in multifamily over the last 30 years, where if you look at multifamily, the numbers are sort of similar. About 15% of the multifamily industry is owned by professional capital, where 85% is owned by small family office and people that have one-off investments. So we would expect SFR over the next couple of decades to hopefully grow in a much better professional manner. 
 Jon, do you want to add anything to that? 
Jonathan Olsen: Yes. I think the other part of your question is the right question. The answer is, at this stage of the game, we don't have a shorthand rubric that we can share in terms of how to think about every X thousand homes brought on the platform through third-party management. 
 I think over time, as we onboard the 2 portfolios that we're looking forward to, the law of large numbers suggests that we ought to be able to do that. But I think it's also important to remember that there are a lot of variables that make a simplification a little bit challenging, right? Market mixes vary, price points vary, sort of degree of up-front renovation done varies. And so I think as we, through our asset management exercises, help shape these portfolios to perform as best they can and as we get more homes on the platform and have more sort of actual operating and financial results we can look at, I think we'll be in a much better position to share what we think is a smart way to think about how much those opportunities can potentially add to the bottom line over time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski from Green Street. 
John Pawlowski: Charles or Dallas, do you have an internal view of -- I know you guys are prioritizing occupancy, but this is a question on market rents. And so do you have an internal view of why market rents aren't growing at a much, much faster clip than they are given the affordability gap you referenced in some of your markets, Dallas, is supplied more than we think? Or is migration into the Sunbelt slower than we think? Just curious what you think the culprit is? 
Charles Young: Yes. I think I wouldn't look at it as a culprit. If you go back outside of the COVID years, we're trending above where we've been historically on both new lease and renewals. So on a blended rate and we're more occupied than we've ever been. And people underestimate the value of that occupancy to our NOI growth. And so look, I think we're just seeing back to normal kind of seasonality. And coming off of COVID, it feels like it's a slowdown. But the reality is, it's still really healthy. To your point, though, there are certain markets that were really humming during the pandemic and they're coming back to earth a little bit, Phoenix and Vegas being a couple of those that we've talked about. 
 I expect that we'll start to see them move kind of more positive on the new lease rate side in the near future as we've gotten them occupied now and things are settling down. Florida has been humming for a long time. South Florida is still really strong right now, if you look at our rates. But Tampa and Orlando are seeing a little bit of a slowdown relative to what we saw over the last couple of years. 
 So generally, it's really strong. There's not a lot of demographic changes that are material but we saw a lot of people moving to Florida and Texas and other markets. That slowed down. And so that's taken away a little bit of the edge. But that, again, just takes us back to where we think we are, which is kind of a normal seasonality and normal kind of undersupply of homes. 
 If you look at us relative to multifamily, we know we're in a good position. Tailwinds are in our favor. We've been able to grow occupancy in a slow season, get occupied and now we're going to capture that demand going forward. So feel like we're in healthy shape. There's some dynamics in individual markets. We can get into it if you have more -- further questions. But generally, we're in good shape. 
Dallas Tanner: Yes. And John, this is Dallas. So I just want to add a couple of things that were just sort of anecdotal that I know you're aware of. With new home construction making up about 30% of the overall kind of home transaction market, people are just staying put a little bit longer, too. And I think you're seeing some of that even in our peers' information. And then we also -- I think Charles sort of mentioned this in a different way, but we just -- we also don't have as much loss to lease as some of the other books of business that might be out there. We had quite a bit of rate growth, which to Charles' point, puts us as at a much better denominator. 
 The other thing I would add is, in that denominator, our customer is now ticked over 3 years on average length of stay. So I think what Charles and I will kind of solve for with the teams from an optimization perspective will be making sure that on our renewal business, we're always capturing as much share of rate that's out there. We obviously want to get as much new lease growth as we can. But I think a bigger portion of our business is going to be renewals than we sort of ever historically thought of, from when we started the company 12 years ago. It just feels like the customer is going to stay longer and longer until we get into a cheaper rate environment where maybe there's more home transaction availability. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. 
James Feldman: So I just wanted to shift gears a little and just talk about the balance sheet and debt strategy. Can you just talk through your plans for the rest of the year? And then as you think about next year with the $3.5 billion of interest rate swaps coming due, just what are you thinking about planning for those? And just how should we think about potential earnings accretion, dilution, as we look through the rest of the year and into next year, just based on how you're currently thinking about your strategy and rates being higher for longer? 
Jonathan Olsen: Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, we have about $3.1 billion of debt maturing in 2026. That, as we talked about, I think, on the last call is comprised of 2 debt instruments. It's $610 million of our last remaining floating rate securitization IH 2018-4 and the $2.5 billion term loan component of our 5-year bank facility. 
 We are sitting on the remaining cash from our August 2023 bond deal. That cash is available to either grow the business or to pay off debt. Today, if we look at where that 2018-4 securitization is swapped to, that is swapped to a rate of about 4.15%, 4.2%. Compare that to what we're earning on the cash sitting on our balance sheet, which is around 5.5%, right? So we're not in a rush to pay that debt off despite the fact that we have ample unrestricted cash sitting on the balance sheet to do so. 
 With respect to the bank facility, we have begun dialogue with our lender partners. We are going to focus on a recast of that facility here over the coming months. We'll obviously keep you posted as that process progresses. But I would say that we feel very comfortable with our access to capital. We feel very comfortable with the balance sheet. And I think it's important to remember, we have plenty of time left. We've shown that we typically aren't going to wait 'til the last minute to do something. But I think we also have bought ourselves the ability to be patient, which is helpful. 
 With respect to the swap book, there are some swaps expiring in November of this year. I would point out that those correspond pretty well to that 2018-4 floating rate securitization. So if we assume that, that swap expiry potentially aligns with the debt repayment, that probably makes sense and I don't anticipate that we would replace that floating rate debt with anything other than fixed rate debt. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho Securities. 
Haendel St. Juste: So Dallas, sorry, one more on third-party management here. I guess I appreciate your comments earlier on the state of housing in the U.S. and the role that SFRs have historically played. But what's different in the latest article from The Wall Street Journal is that it's coming from the Republican governor of Texas, a large and deep red state calling for legislative -- some things to be added to the legislative agenda in Texas to protect families. So you guys are based in Texas. I'm curious what you're hearing and potentially expecting on that front and how it might impact your plans to potentially add to your portfolio in Texas, which is still only about 6% of your total revenue? 
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Haendel. You're right in that Texas doesn't represent a very big portion of our business. Look, I hate to speculate on any comment that I don't have sort of the full context of. We're active at both state and local levels in Texas and other markets. And everything we're hearing on the ground is pretty pro-housing and pretty friendly in terms of where state legislatures are and things that they want to focus on. 
 We've had a number of wins in Georgia and Florida, North Carolina over the last year. We've even seen some of the, what I would call, really crazy bills in California get shelved in the last little bit and it feels like there's sort of a little bit of a pendulum swing to moderation. 
 Look, the tricky part about housing generally in the country is going to be that it's a social issue over and over and over. And the affordability issues that have been in the country really for the last decade since the GFC, are largely supply-driven in nature. 
 I'm not an expert on political matters and/or where people are going to fall on any one particular issue. I have become well versed in that we see a lot of headlines all the time. And there's click bait and we live in a 24-hour news cycle where things can also get taken out of context very quickly. 
 And so our focus is, as a provider of housing, to be consistent, both in the things that Charles and Jon shared and Scott around deliveries, execution, how we view the customer experience and creating this kind of lifestyle flexibility for a massive subset of consumers that are nearly 47 million households deep. SFR represents about 10 bps of that, at the end of the day. And so those 10 bps in the way that we behave, I think, are the only things that we can control in the real time, which is just be a great business that offers flexibility and service. 
 And by the way, have the conversations at state and local levels as we continue to build out our thesis around housing to make sure that we're part of the solutions and that the facts are actually understood. And I think that particular article was disappointing. The headline reads one way and as you get into the article deeper, you realize that a lot of the facts in the subset suggests that a lot of this stuff isn't gaining traction because I think as you get into the data, you start to figure out that we need many different types of solutions to come out of this problem. 
 So we'll be one part of a subset of many, but the question makes sense, Haendel. Can't tell you what any particular politician is thinking at any given time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein from Bank of America. 
Joshua Dennerlein: Jon, just wanted to follow up on a comment you made on the fees you're receiving from the management contracts are being offset by some investment set -- investment spend. How should we think about the duration of that investment spend? And could you elaborate on maybe just what that investment spend entails? 
Jonathan Olsen: Yes. Look, I think as we onboard these portfolios, obviously, we need to add some heads in the field; we need to add some heads in the back office; and we need to make some technology investments. I don't anticipate that we're going to be perfect at this coming out of the gate. The good news is, as we've talked about, this is a really attractive, high-margin business for us. But just as we spent years optimizing our balance sheet, optimizing our operating platform, iterating towards a better outcome and sort of a better structure, we're going to be doing the same with respect to the third-party property management business. 
 So some of these incremental costs that show up in property management expense are upfront and onetime in nature and will spread across the majority of these new agreements. Some of them are more variable and are going to correlate more strongly to the number of homes that come online. But I think big picture, this is a really attractive business from an earnings contribution perspective. And our expectation is that we should be able to make those margins higher for us as we get more and more efficient in terms of how we manage. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley. 
Adam Kramer: It was asked a little bit earlier, let me try to ask in a different way. I just wanted to ask about maybe how your expectations for new and renewal growth for 2024 compared to your expectations the last time we chatted, roughly 3 months ago? I know you didn't provide specific numbers at that point. Can you maybe just walk us through, given you've now had 4 months, right, and I think additional visibility, [ you said ] renewals, for the next few months, how do your expectations for new and renewal growth stay compared to what you provided 3 months ago? 
Jonathan Olsen: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think, obviously, we have not revised guidance. We continue to feel very comfortable with our expectations for where blended rate growth will shake out over the course of the year. What we've said is, we expect the blend to be high 4s, low 5s. 
 Look, we're sitting here on May 1, we feel really good about the results we saw in the first quarter. We feel really good about the fact that it's aligning very, very closely with how we sort of shaped guidance and our view for how the year would likely progress. So I'm not sure that there's really much, if any, change. I think the May blend of 5.2% that Charles alluded to earlier is reflective of things kind of falling in line the way we expected them to. 
Charles Young: Sorry, the April blend of 5.2%, just to clarify. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Tricarico from Scotiabank. 
Daniel Tricarico: On the acquisitions in the quarter, you quoted a 6.1% cap rate in the sup. Curious if you could break down what percentage of those are from homebuilder pipeline versus the traditional MLS and what the spread on cap rates looks like today between those 2 channels? 
Scott Eisen: Yes. I would say that -- this is Scott Eisen. Great question. From our perspective, a majority of what we're doing right now is with the homebuilder direct purchasing. We're doing very little on the MLS right now. We focus most of our efforts on growing our third-party management business and also focusing on doing more deals with our homebuilder partners. 
 And look, we are still, as we've said before, targeting these homebuilder acquisitions in and around a 6% cap in terms of what our yield on cost expectation is for these transactions. And in terms of dispositions, I think we're still in the market disposing as we had said we would and it's still in that range of the 4-ish cap or so in terms of the dispo rate. And I don't think anything has changed materially in terms of what we're seeing in terms of that acquisition yield. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jesse Lederman from Zelman & Associates. 
Jesse Lederman: Nice job during the quarter. You noted at a recent conference, you expect new move-in rent growth to exceed renewal rent growth this summer consistent with your typical trajectory, maybe pre-COVID. Can you discuss what you're seeing in the market that gives you confidence new move-in rent growth will accelerate roughly 300 basis points from April and how that 300 basis points relates to the typical, call it, April to summer peak acceleration? 
Charles Young: Yes. We're seeing that typical kind of acceleration into -- on the new lease side into the summer. And we usually peak somewhere in June, maybe July. It varies year by year, whether new lease will overtake renewals. I can't predict that this year. I don't think I've said that, but we typically see that you're going to see new lease accelerate, peak in the summer and renewals will stay steady throughout the year. 
 I could see renewals moderating slightly in the summer, as Dallas mentioned. The loss to lease is a little lower over the summer, that cohort, we've kind of pushed on demand. So that might bring it down. So we'll see how it goes. I think as we've talked about, we're in a really kind of healthy and/or typical season and where it works out for the summer will be determined. 
 That said, we are seeing the acceleration that we expected to see from the start of the year. We started January as we're building up the occupancy, negative on new lease rent growth and now in April at 3.1% and accelerating into May, we'll see where it takes us for the summer. We're right where we want it to be. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Gorman from BTIG. 
Michael Gorman: Apologies if I missed this, but could you just spend a little bit of time talking about the insurance renewal that you mentioned in the sup. And maybe just talk about if there's any change in coverage levels or any other terms that allowed for the execution there on the pricing? 
 And then I guess just -- I know you left guidance unchanged but is there anything left that would potentially push insurance back up to the initial guidance range of mid- to high teens growth from the 7.5% that's implied? 
Jonathan Olsen: Yes. So great question. Thank you. There is nothing left that would cause insurance to come in higher. We, working with our insurance brokers, sort of formed an early view and that was reflected in our initial guidance over the course of kind of our annual trips to London and Bermuda to meet with underwriters and sort of help explain all the reasons why our business have a number of really attractive risk -- built-in risk mitigants, coupled with the fact that reinsurance treaties came in much more constructive than last year, we were really pleased with the outcome there. I think at the end of the day, however, insurance is a relatively small line item for us. So there's not a ton in it. 
 What's going to be much more impactful, obviously, is property tax. As we talked about, the fact that expenses were sort of as elevated as they were year-over-year here in the first quarter is largely attributable to the fact that we were under accrued on property tax in each of the first 3 quarters last year. So when people see the expense growth numbers, that is sort of to be expected and that was also baked into our guidance. 
 Specifically, what caused our insurance renewal to be so positive, I think a lot of it is driven by the market environment. But there are also some nice things about our business that benefit us. We're not coastal. We have the ability to asset manage on a house-by-house basis. And I think it's a nice reminder of the scale of our business. 
 On average, our insurance costs per home in the state of Florida, for example, are less than $1,000. For a homeowner, that's probably between $5,000 and $6,000 annually at the price points where we operate. So I think that's a really nice sort of testament to the benefits of scale. 
 And then to answer the first part of your question last, just to round it out, we made no changes to our policy structure or limits or anything of that nature. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. 
Linda Yu Tsai: If renewals are a bigger part of your business going forward, how much more does this expand your margins over time? And how do we quantify how much less turn each quarter reduces OpEx? 
Charles Young: I'll let Jon answer anything in terms of the kind of margin expansion. But for us, if you go back and look at our business pre-pandemic, we were moving turnover down year-over-year. It really kind of bottomed out during the pandemic. But we're back on that track where we're just really healthy turnover and a lot of that is driven by having high renewals. And it's a balance of some of the tailwinds that we've talked about in the industry, but also a big part of our Genuine Care and how we serve the resident and people want to stay with us longer, getting over 3 years now, with California getting closer to 5 years. It's a really healthy position. 
 And that's what shows up in our occupancy. You take that low turnover plus good days to re-resident that we've been operating at and keeps the occupancy high. And from there, I think given, as Dallas said, it's a really nice opportunity and lifestyle, yet we see that people for moving out, reasons to buy home is lower -- as low as it's ever been in the last few years. It's leading to really kind of strong -- low turnover and strong renewals. And as Dallas said, we expect it will be a strong part of our -- big part of our business going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Conor Peaks from Deutsche Bank. 
Conor Peaks: I think you touched on this a little bit earlier, but if we could discuss the economics around the homebuilders and maybe specifically why Invitation can get higher yields versus the homebuilder selling to individual buyers. 
Dallas Tanner: This is Dallas. And anything I don't cover, Scott, if you would like to add anything, please do. I think taking a step back, one thing that's come full circle and been evident to us as we've started growing a lot of these relationships over the last several years has been sort of the following. One, I think the homebuilder industry recognizes a need for for-lease product. They have a number of customers that come through that can't qualify for mortgage but they want to be in great communities with access to good schools, et cetera. 
 I think they view partners like us as a more fleet side of their business where we can do significant amounts of scales to get together at reduced costs and I would add, I believe, on their end, it's a much easier efficiency. We know exactly what we want to have inside our homes and we're happy to take multiple different elevations on the exterior, but they're building us the same product over and over and over. 
 Two, we can also help with the way that we structure those transactions to help alleviate burden of cost. And I think there is just a natural market that exists somewhere in the middle. 
 The second piece of it is, and I can't speak for homebuilders, I think they view the retail business as a terrific business for them and they've been able to kind of work through even a higher rate environment. But I also think that we help derisk a portion of their future thinking. And so I think there is a natural symmetry between professional capital that wants to operate in the for-lease business, much like you see in multifamily, versus maybe an owner operator or a just purely fee simple builder. 
 And then at the regional levels, we can actually, I think, help some of these smaller builders in ways that a lot of regional banks have not been able to facilitate over the last, say year or so, where we can also help derisk some of the costs there and create some certainty around the production of new housing units. 
 So there's just -- it makes sense. It's a lot like the car business, where you pick any big car manufacturer in the U.S., a massive portion of their business is retail and they have a system outline to be successful in that category. But then they also sell to the Hertz and the Progressives and the 24-hour rental companies that we all lease from at different airports around the country. 
 I think our business can evolve in a way with homebuilders, and I say that in the plural sense, in a way that it is a very commercial relationship over time and distance, where we are a small part of what they do but we do it in such a meaningful way and we try to be a great partner that it's a no-brainer, that we should try to do as much as we can together. 
Scott Eisen: Conor, it's Scott Eisen. The only other thing I would add here is, look, a builder, it gives them confidence to take on a larger project and create more homes when they know that Invitation Homes is going to be buying a portion of that project. And so as a result, maybe they might only start a 200-home community but with us as their partner, they might start a 300-home community. 
 Also, as you asked about the relative pricing, remember, they're saving on things like sales and marketing costs when they work with us because they're not actually having to go out in the market and market those homes themselves.
 And then lastly, I think I would add that in terms of when we get deliveries, we get deliveries on average between 8 and 10 homes a month from a builder, when normally they might only be selling 3 to 5 homes a month from the -- through the retail market. 
 So you put all these 3 things together, it's a reason why what we're doing is accretive to the builders and frankly, supplements what they try to do in terms of selling to individual retail customers. 
Operator: Our last question today will come from Buck Horne from Raymond James. 
Buck Horne: I just want to follow up on that a little bit here because I guess the question from my mind on this topic is that you're not the only one in the market trying to negotiate deals with builders and it's obviously a really hot topic. And so there's a lot of capital chasing deals with builders. But I guess you're talking about still being able to negotiate those 6% yield on cost numbers when everyone else is kind of saying maybe those numbers are in the 4s. 
 I guess what's the secret sauce or is there a secret sauce other than what you guys have described so far to achieving those kinds of numbers? 
Dallas Tanner: Really good question. And I appreciate you following up, Buck, because maybe I didn't answer this very well in the question before. It centers around predictability. We have predictability in our operating margins. We have predictability in showing up and closing. We have a really great track record in the market with M&A and with the ability to close when asked to. Our operating margins, which, by the way, I think would add to a lot of the inbound interest we've had in 3PM, are an attractive thing for investors and I think they're an attractive thing for operators in the marketplace. 
 We see very quickly in just some of the transactions we've looked at and are doing in 3PM, immediate margin pickup for our partners just by doing a couple of things differently. And so -- and a lot of that, as you know, Buck, it has to do with scale. When you have a business that's 97.5% occupied, growing revenue in the mid-5s and we're now in a decelerating cost environment as we view property tax and cost of goods sold and all these things, like we could not have better blue sky situation for our business as we think about the next couple of years. We're positioned very nicely. 
 We're just getting started in our access to these homebuilder relationships. Like anything professionally that we've done in the first 12 years, these things develop over time and as you build trust. And I think for us, it's the same way we approach our opportunities with the homebuilding industry. It's the same way we're going to approach risk in 3PM. We want to work with the best and the most professional capital that's out there because those expectations we have of each other matter and that we'll show up and do the things that we said we'll do equally matter. 
 I think that's going to lend itself to conditional outperformance as you look at that, Buck, to your question, specifically, relative to maybe other operators that are in the space that don't have the scale or the capacity or the ability to close on this kind of scale and to seamlessly integrate it. 
 So I give Charles in the field and Jon in the back office all the kudos, as Scott and his team are out there developing these relationships and trying to build what will be the next decade of growth for Invitation Homes. The SFR industry is going to be about bringing new housing supply into the marketplace. That is the narrative as I see it for the next several years. It's going to be about creating new product, bringing new product into these markets and doing it at yields, Buck, to your point, that make sense and on a risk-adjusted basis, a total return profile that makes sense for us and our shareholders. 
Operator: This completes our question-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks. 
Dallas Tanner: We thank everyone for attending our call. We're grateful for your participation. We look forward to seeing everybody at Nareit in June. Thank you for your time today. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-14 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Invitation Homes Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Scott McLaughlin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Scott McLaughlin: Good morning and welcome. I'm here today from Invitation Homes with Dallas Tanner, Chief Executive Officer; Charles Young, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jon Olsen, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Eisen, Chief Investment Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session with our covering sell-side analysts. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and then re-queue if you'd like to ask a follow-up question. During today's call, we may reference our fourth quarter 2023 earnings release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, in yesterday's earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Dallas Tanner, our Chief Executive Officer.
Dallas Tanner: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our customers' needs are straightforward. They want to lease a great home in a safe neighborhood with great schools and easy access to jobs. They want professional services and genuine care, and they want flexibility and convenience that allows them to live more freely. 12 years ago, a lot of these options either didn't exist or weren't readily available. Today, they all do, thanks to the hard work and the commitment of our associates, thanks to the mission of this company that together with you, we make a house a home, and thanks to the hundreds of thousands of residents who have put their trust in us to do exactly that. Last year marked many important milestones for Invitation Homes. We returned to a more sustainable growth profile, while continuing to expand and improve on the overall resident experience. It was a year in which we helped our homebuilder partners start construction on thousands of much needed new homes across the country. It was a year in which we recycled over $500 million of capital, selling nearly 1,500 homes on the MLS, predominantly to homeowners. And it was a year in which we executed one of the more significant portfolio acquisitions in our company's history. We are excited to continue this momentum into 2024, as we expand on what it means to live in an Invitation Home. By this, I'm referring to last month's announcement that our industry-leading operating platform is now available to not just our residents and joint venture partners, but also to large portfolio owners who are seeking the best in single-family property management for their residents and the best in single-family asset management for their investors. Let me be really clear here. We believe providing professional property and asset management services is both a logical next step for our business, as well as a strategic significant leap forward. It empowers us to accretively leverage our platform in a capital-light manner, while helping us to achieve further scale, increased efficiency and additional margin expansion for our company, and substantial savings and convenience for our residents. It all began with last month's inaugural agreement to become the property and asset manager on over 14,000 single-family homes. We expect this agreement to drive incremental AFFO of a couple of cents per share in 2024. This results from meaningful property management and asset management fees that we believe fairly compensate us for our unrivaled capability, scale and expertise. In addition to this, we'll also earn an outsized share of value-add service revenues such as from smart home, bundled Internet and other initiatives we may roll out in the future, along with potential future incentives, based on the operating and financial performance we're able to drive over time. We believe this inaugural agreement is the first of what could be many such arrangements. As we pursue additional opportunities, we expect professional management to help us build and grow strategic relationships, while we continue to become even more efficient through greater density, improved procurement, better resident engagement and thoughtful use of data and technology. Most importantly, as in other REIT subsectors, we expect professional management can help us create a pipeline of potential future acquisition opportunities for homes about which we'll have an information advantage. In the meantime, we believe the fundamental tailwinds for our business will continue to drive outsized NOI and earnings growth relative to other REIT property types. This includes a well-documented lack of new housing supply across our markets, as well as the strong demand from a surge of young adults who are just starting to reach our average new resident age in their late 30s. These younger generations often favor experiences over possessions and prefer convenience and flexibility over financial anchors and 30 year contracts. It's also important that we underscore the massive savings from leasing a home today versus owning. Using John Burns' fourth quarter data as weighted by our markets, it is $1,200 per month less expensive to lease a home than to own it. That's an average savings for our residents of over $14,000 a year. We see this reflected in our latest surveys, in which a substantial majority of our new residents say that our rents and services are affordably priced. One of these services, which we just started to provide last year completely free of charge, is Esusu's positive credit reporting program. Already, over half of our residents have improved their credit score since enrolling, with the average credit score improvement of about 35 points. This could help our residents achieve thousands of dollars in lifetime savings on their borrowing costs, further enhancing the value proposition for leasing a home with us. In summary, we're very proud of the choices we offer individuals and families to live in a great home without the high costs and burdens of home ownership. We remain committed to investing in our technology, systems, value-add services and other tools to help our residents thrive. And we're excited by how we can continue to grow our business, further enhance the resident experience and meaningfully broaden the professional services we offer. In this regard, we truly believe we are just getting started. With that, I'll pass the call on to Charles Young, our President and Chief Operating Officer.
Charles Young: Thanks, Dallas. Our fourth quarter operating results were a solid finish to close out the year. In particular, our teams worked hard to deliver strong same store NOI growth, occupancy and resident service. In 2023, we saw a return to more normal patterns of rent growth, seasonality and lease compliance. And as Dallas mentioned, it was a year of working towards several new milestones, including our large portfolio acquisition in July and getting prepared to provide professional third party management services. Our local market teams continue to take all of this in stride. It's what we do, they often tell me, and I'm very grateful for their attitudes and achievements. Thanks to these strong efforts, I am pleased to see how efficiently and effectively we have onboarded these new homes, engaged with our new residents and rolled out desirable new services. I'll now walk you through our operating results in more detail. Same store NOI growth of 5.6% in the fourth quarter brought our full-year 2023 same store NOI growth to 4.8%. Same store core revenues in the fourth quarter grew 5.9% year-over-year. This increase was driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 5.3%, an 11.2% increase in other income, and a 50 basis point year-over-year improvement in bad debt. That marks three consecutive quarters of improvement in bad debt. I'm pleased to see lease compliance continuing to move in the right direction, while at the same time, also seeing our new residents' household income reach its highest level to date, just shy of $150,000 a year on average during 2023. This represents an income-to-rent ratio of 5.4 times that is indicative of the high quality, location and desirability of our homes. Returning to same store growth results, full-year 2023 same store revenue growth was 6.5%, while full-year same store core expense growth was 10.3%. The main drivers of this expense growth included the temporary cost of working through our lease compliance backlog, which drove higher property administrative and turnover cost, as well as higher property tax and insurance expense. By contrast, repairs and maintenance expense came in flat for the full-year 2023, a testament to moderating inflation pressures and our team's ability to effectively control costs. Next, I'll cover leasing trends in the fourth quarter 2023. As we typically do in the slower winter leasing season, we prioritized higher occupancy in the fourth quarter to better position our portfolio as we head into our upcoming peak leasing season. As a result, same store average occupancy grew each month, averaging 97.1% in the fourth quarter. In addition, new lease rate growth was flat during the quarter, representing an expected return to more normal seasonal trends, while renewal lease growth of 6.8% was the highest we've seen in the fourth quarter other than during the pandemic. As renewals comprise a substantial majority of our leasing business, this strong result drove a fourth quarter blended rent growth of 4.6%. I'll now also share our January 2024 same store leasing results. We started the year off with an increase in average occupancy to 97.5%. In addition, January blended rent growth was 3.5%, comprised of renewal rent growth of 5.9% and a negative new lease growth of 1.5%. Early indications lead us to believe that new lease rates have already begun to turn positive again in February's activity to date. In combination with the favorable tailwinds that Dallas mentioned and the strong delivery by our teams, we believe we are well positioned to capture strong demand for our homes as we enter the traditional peak leasing season later this month and to continue to provide the best resident experience in the industry. I'll now turn the call over to Jon Olsen, our Chief Financial Officer.
Jonathan Olsen: Thanks Charles. Today, I'll cover the following topics: first, an update on our investment-grade rated balance sheet and the capital markets; second, financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023; and finally, 2024 full-year guidance. Leading off with the balance sheet, I'll start with several of our team's key accomplishments in 2023. These include $800 million of senior notes that we issued at approximately 5.5% in August, as well as outlook or ratings upgrades from all three of our corporate credit rating agencies during the year. We ended 2023 with $1.7 billion in available liquidity, which includes $700 million of unrestricted cash and $1 billion of capacity on our undrawn revolving credit facility. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio improved to 5.5 times as of December 31, 2023, down from 5.7 times as of the year prior. And 99.4% of our total debt was fixed rate or swapped to fixed rate as of year-end 2023, with over 75% of our total debt unsecured and no debt reaching final maturity prior to 2026. I'm really pleased by the meaningful execution our teams delivered last year and believe our balance sheet continues to offer us strong positioning to achieve our goals in 2024 and beyond. I'll now cover our recent financial results and year-over-year growth. Core FFO for the fourth quarter 2023 was $0.45 per share, an increase of 4.6%, while core FFO for the full-year 2023 was $1.77 per share, an increase of 6%. AFFO for the fourth quarter 2023 was $0.38 per share, an increase of 5.8%, and AFFO for the full-year 2023 was $1.50 per share, an increase of 6.3%. These strong results were primarily driven by higher same store NOI during the quarter and full year. The last thing I'll cover is 2024 guidance. This is led by our expectation for same store NOI growth in a range of 3.5% to 5.5%, resulting from expected same store core revenue growth in the range of 4.5% to 5.5% and same store core expense growth in the range of 5.5% to 7%. Our same store core revenue growth guidance assumes 2024 average occupancy will be similar to our full year 2023 result. In addition, guidance assumes same store blended rent growth in the high-4% to low-5% range and continued improvement in our bad debt as a percentage of rental revenue to an expected range of 65 basis points to 95 basis points. Our same store core expense growth guidance assumes higher fixed expense growth to continue in 2024, with property tax expense growth in a range of 8% to 10% and insurance expense growth in the mid-to-high teens. We expect this to be partially offset by moderating growth in our controllable expenses. From a timing perspective, we anticipate same store NOI growth will be higher in the second half of the year than in the first half. All of this brings our full-year 2024 core FFO guidance to a range of $1.82 to $1.90 per share. This guidance assumes as a base case that we will acquire between $600 million and $1 billion of homes on balance sheet in 2024, mostly from our homebuilder partners and via portfolio acquisitions. We expect to fund much of these home purchases by continuing to accretively recycle capital from wholly-owned dispositions in an expected range of between $400 million and $600 million. A detailed bridge of 2023 core FFO per share to the midpoint of our 2024 guidance is included within last night's earnings release. Lastly, we provided full-year 2024 AFFO guidance in a range of a $1.54 to $1.62 per share. As a result of our anticipated growth in AFFO per share in 2024, last month, we increased our quarterly dividend by nearly 8% to $0.28 per share. In closing, we plan to keep a close eye on the capital markets throughout the year and continue our long track record of being disciplined and proactive. We'll prudently pursue opportunities for meaningful growth and accretive capital recycling, and we'll continue to lead the industry in our quest to provide the best choices, convenience and overall resident experience for the millions of Americans who prefer to lease a single-family home. With that, we have now concluded our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. A question on the guidance, and what does the guidance assume in terms of new and renewal lease spreads as we move through 2024? And new lease spreads were flat in the fourth quarter. That's kind of below historical levels and was negative in January. What gives you confidence that you can kind of maintain your renewal spreads in this sort of environment?
Charles Young: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start off -- this is Charles -- and just talk a little bit around where we currently are in terms of rate and occupancy. As we signaled on the last call, we purposely pushed for occupancy in the fourth quarter to set us up for a peak leasing season. We looked at the landscape back in September and October and decided to get aggressive on occupancy. What we were seeing was return to normal seasonality, as I mentioned. We're also coming off a little bit of a spike in turnover in Q3 from the lease compliance cleanup, which is a good thing, and it's part of why we have confidence in where we're going on bad debt. We also saw some local supply pressures. And when we step back, we know that history tells us is best to be full going into peak leasing season, and that's exactly where we are. So today, we're sitting at 97.5% occupancy in January and a position of strength, and we're going to start to lean in on the rate side now. And what we're seeing already from January into February is an acceleration into February and into spring leasing season. As we lean in on that rate, you can also see that renewals have stayed steady. And as a reminder, that's the majority of our lease, as we pull through usually around 75%. Our blend in January is at 3.5%, which is really healthy. If you look back on historical rates pre-pandemic of 2018, 2019 or 2020, we're right in line where we want to be. And with acceleration into February, we feel really good. So what I'll leave at you is, we'll give an update in February on -- in March when -- at the Citi conference, but we like our positioning, and it has put us in a good place with our occupancy, and we'll go from there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
James Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess just a follow-up on the new lease rates. If you look at the weakness you had in 4Q, clearly, those are some of the markets that have a lot more supply in the build-to-rent business. What are the odds here that maybe you get caught off guard, surprise at downside, just how much supply pressure there really is in those markets, and it's just more than seasonal? Kind of what gives you comfort that the supply story won't be too bad? Or maybe just give us your thoughts on supply in those major markets where you did see the weakest new rents.
Charles Young: Yes. So you're probably calling out Phoenix, a little bit of Vegas. Two things I'd highlight. One, we -- some of that confidence comes from our current level of occupancy. We're in that position of strength, so we can kind of hold and know we're not trying to solve for the occupancy and we can lean in. We're also seeing that we've gotten occupied in those specific areas. So the demand is still there. That's what's great. We're still seeing strong demand. We wouldn't have been able to move occupancy from a low of 96.8% up to 97.5% if that demand wasn't there. So, as you go into spring -- and we're also -- when you bring up to build-to-rent relative to our infill portfolio, that puts us in a really strong position to think about the same store able to hold, given that we're in that position of strength. And we're already seeing some acceleration from January into February.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Eric Wolfe: Hi, thanks. For your bad debt guidance, can you talk about where you expect to start the year and how you get comfortable with that? So, do you start at over 100 basis points and then kind of end around 50 basis points? Or is just some point in the year where the bad debt should step down?
Jonathan Olsen: Yes, thanks. It's a good question. We made great strides in reducing bad debt in 2023. If you look back to the fourth quarter of 2022, same store bad debt was 170 basis points. So we improved 50 basis points year-over-year to the 120 basis points we saw in Q4 of last year. That improvement came against a backdrop in which rental assistance decreased by $57 million year-over-year. And between the first quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2023, we had four markets that improved bad debt by between 100 basis points and 265 basis points. We continue to see a healthy percentage of lease compliance move-outs, which allows us to keep increasing the proportion of residents who are making timely payments. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Atlanta and Southern California were two of our markets with the highest levels of bad debt, but they are also two of the highest markets in terms of lease compliance move-outs. So, that's really part of the continued progress we're making with respect to bad debt. I think it's also important to point out that comparing our 2024 bad debt guidance with our 2023 actual result has a few challenges. Bad debt in the first quarter of 2023 was 180 basis points, which was one of our worst results since the start of the pandemic. That Q1 result caused an outsized impact on our overall 2023 full year bad debt results. Our quarter-over-quarter improvements in bad debt really began in the second quarter of 2023, and that improvement has continued every quarter since then. I think it's also important to note that the reasons for that outsized bad debt result in the first quarter of 2023 don't really exist any longer. We had restrictions -- at the first part of last year, there were restrictions in place in Southern California that prevented us from beginning to work through our delinquency backlog. It's not like it was a January 1 kickoff. And so, over time, I think the moratorium is burning off and improvement in the significant court backlogs we saw in the first half of last year have really eased for us. Bad debt in the second half of 2023 was significantly better than in the first half, despite the fact that rent assistance was less than half it was -- half of what it was in the first half. I would also point out that we are not assuming any rental assistance in our 2024 guidance. So I think if you put it all together, having the ability to enforce the terms of our leases from the start of the year in 2024 will allow us to continue to make steady improvements over the course of this year. But obviously, it's going to continue to be a major area of focus for us, and we're prepared to go out and execute.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Spector: Great. Thank you. Can you talk more about the new customer demand? I believe you mentioned in January, new rate was minus 1.5%. I guess, can you talk about that strength in demand and then put into context how that number compares to prior years when you talk about normal seasonality, and then, maybe what you would expect as we move into peak leasing, which I believe you said should start at the end of this month? Thank you.
Charles Young: Yes. No, great question. This is Charles. As we mentioned, seasonality has returned. During the pandemic, it was really high occupancy, high demand. It was abnormal. And if you go back and think about our pre-pandemic years, 2018, 2019, 2020, when we were full like we are now, we're really seeing that similar type of demand. That's seasonal. That slows down typically in and into Q1 and picks up right after the Super Bowl, which just happened. So we're in a place now where we're looking across the portfolio. We're seeing that we're occupied. We did what we wanted to there. And we see the demand. It's not the same exact levels that we saw during the pandemic, but those are artificially high. When you go back and you compare it to our 2018, 2019, early 2020, we're right in line with what we've seen historical, and we're in really good shape in terms of our occupancy and our blended rent growth going into now accelerating spring leasing season.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Charles, how have you been -- have you been offering any concessions to drive some of the traffic and build occupancy here during the softer part of the season? And maybe just to push back a little bit on your comment on renewal rates remaining steady, if I recall, you were sending out renewal notices in the 9%-plus arena and ended up kind of below 7% for the quarter. So how is that dynamic also playing out early in the year as to where you're sending out increases and what you're achieving? Thanks.
Charles Young: Yes, a couple of thoughts there. One, as we said, we pivoted to occupancy. That's on new lease and on renewals. And so, while we went out in 8s and low-9s in Q4, we told the teams, negotiate. We wanted to try to make sure that we're keeping occupancy high. So we've done that. As you look forward now, we went out in February in the low-8s and April and May in the high-7s. Again, if you look back historically, these are really great rates. And we'll see where that all kind of settles out. But when you think about we're looking at the combination of accelerating new lease and holding steady on renewals, we look at that blend and say, we're in really healthy shape relative to any historical period outside of the pandemic. Going back to your original question around concessions, we are running no concessions on any of the same store portfolio right now. We really -- we talked about this on the last call. We pushed hard prior to the holidays. So we ran some concessions in November prior to Thanksgiving, and then we took them off. And that was all around just trying to accelerate demand while it was still there, knowing that things slow down come December, January. And today, if there's any concessions out there, it might be one-off on some of our smaller build-to-rent areas where we talked about where there may be some more competition in Phoenix or Vegas, but outside of that, minimal concessions and not in the same store portfolio at all.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go head. Your line is open.
Stephen Sakwa: Yes, thanks. Good morning. I guess I wanted to pivot a little bit to expenses and just get your thoughts around the real estate taxes and insurance commentary that you put in the release. And if you do the math, I guess, on those numbers, against your overall expense growth, it sort of implies something in the 1% to 2% range for the rest of the expense line item. So, just some comments around kind of that low growth rate on the other items would be great. Thanks.
Jonathan Olsen: Yes. Thanks, Steve. It's Jon. Good question. I think you're right. If you look at it, our expectation is that we will see some moderation in controllable expense growth. Last year was a very heavy year in terms of turnover, in terms of all the things that we're doing in the background to work through our lease compliance backlog. And so, from a comparability standpoint, year-over-year, we don't anticipate seeing sizable increases in those line items. I would also note that the operations team has done a fantastic job over time of continuing to make the R&M portion of our business more and more efficient. And I think as we look at the controllable side of the house, we feel really good about where we are. I think a big part of what makes our platform so powerful is the ability to continue to drive more efficiency. And I would also note that our entree into third-party management will, over time and distance, have benefits for the operating efficiency of our owned portfolio. But I would also point out that, that is not factored into our guidance for 2024.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski from Green Street. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Hi. Thanks for the time. I want to talk through the guidance for it sounded like blended rent spreads of high-4% to low-5% expected for this year. But then, you marry that with, Dallas, your opening remarks, and the massive affordability gap between the cost to own versus cost of rent, so I guess, why aren't we seeing larger rent spikes or the ability to push rents in a much higher clip? Is there true price sensitivity among tenants? Or is there any self-governing of rent increases going on in the platform?
Dallas Tanner: Hi, John, Dallas. Really good question. I think by and large, and I believe Charles would echo the same here, we're not seeing any degradation necessarily in demand. When you have vacant product on the market, especially at year-end, Charles, I think, summed it up really well, where you do have to compete a little bit more like we did traditionally in 2017, 2018 and 2019. It feels to us, based on what we're seeing with the customer, our average rent to income ratios right now are 5.4 times, so we're qualifying a much more qualified customer at about an average household income of $150,000. We don't necessarily disagree, John, that there could be some upside to those numbers throughout the year. We're certainly not baking that into our guidance. I think we've had the luxury in the last few years of thinking about massive tailwinds, putting pressure on rate. We are going to view 2024, at least sitting here in early February, to be more in line with traditional years pre-pandemic. We're going to see seasonality in the curve. I think the positives, though, to necessarily call out your question, are we have a more full portfolio as we go into 2024. We have a customer that's more qualified, and we're far more sophisticated in the way that we capture that demand. So I like our chances as we head into the year. All things being equal, we do also want to be sensitive to the fact that we are in sort of a slowing growth environment macro-wise for the country, and just be sort of modestly aggressive in our approach. And so, I like where we're sitting with the year. I think Charles summed it up well from an occupancy perspective. Our goal is to go out and execute, manage cost controls and make sure that we deliver. And I think you're right to sort of point out that there could be more demand in the market throughout the year. It's just too early to tell. We'll have a better sense as we get through peak and into the summer.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Haendel St. Juste: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Dallas, I guess, my question is on the property management platform. So the guide for this year includes $0.02 from Starwood that many of us weren't expecting. But I'm more curious about the opportunity -- the fees you're charging -- are able to charge this business. How we should think about the sizing of the opportunity, the ability to scale it over the near term? And how you might be thinking about the risk and maybe perception for this in what is clearly a very sensitive political sector? The apartment REITs are facing class action lawsuit over revenue management sharing or allegedly sharing of information. So with political season ahead of us, I'm sure this subsector will face incremental scrutiny. So maybe, again, just the high-level opportunity, the pricing, the opportunity scale it up and how you're thinking about some of the risks. Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Haendel. So first, I think what I'd sort of take a step back and if you look at multi-family, professional management has been in place for decades. There are wonderful companies, both in the public and private sector, that do a really good job managing scale and creating services and predictability of experience that I think the single-family rental space has yet to achieve, except for a couple of us larger operators. I think our goal has been over time to be methodical in our approach to would we do this and what would be the reason for doing so. One, you called out appropriately, which is I think there is an adverse ability to drive efficiencies for other professional owners of single-family rental, but to do it in a very deliberate and purposeful way on our behalf. So I think we've been pretty clear from the outset, as we've talked about this over the last couple of quarters and conferences, that we believe the size and scale of our platform is meaningful. We believe as the sector starts to develop professional services and ancillary opportunities for our customers that you can provide that at a much better cost and help drive down the cost of living for people, but you need scale. And so, for us, I think we want to work with professional capital, professional size, and create those efficiencies that we already enjoy in our portfolio for our customers. But by and large, over time, that will also have a compounding effect for us that we can go out and price and procure opportunities that will be beneficial to our residents as well. In terms of kind of what that scale could be over time and those factors, look, we wouldn't do it if it wasn't an effective way to create shareholder earnings for our company and for our shareholders. But we're not in the business of looking at doing this in small scale. We want to work with professional capital of scale. And it ultimately becomes, I believe, a good opportunity for us as the manager of those assets to be -- obviously have better market intel on what those portfolios are doing. It can inform us of better opportunities of how we can actually enhance our own businesses, and we can certainly drive efficiencies in our future pipelines for growth. The last comment I would make is, as you look at our platform today, we now have two markets that are well into the tens of thousands of units. That in itself will allow us to get creative on services we provide residents, efficiencies and economies of scale, and how we deliver those services. And I think ultimately, we're going to learn a whole heck of a lot more about how our platform gets more and more efficient over time to drive further margin expansion.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. Just a question on the acquisitions. You previously talked about maybe some freeing up of portfolios with some of the debt maturity issues, so for caps kind of wearing down or running out. Just curious on what you're seeing on the portfolio acquisition opportunity set to start the year. Thanks.
Scott Eisen: Hi. It's Scott Eisen. Thanks for the question. Look, we are in the market right now, obviously, in dialogue with various people about opportunities. I think clearly, we are seeing some owners of portfolios where what was very cheap debt a few years ago is now breakeven to negative on cash flow. And I think there are people out there that are looking to explore their opportunities, and we're looking at options on acquisitions that is accretive to us, we think could be interesting growth opportunities for us. It is clear that there are some people out there that never fixed and were floating on it, and those opportunities, I think, could potentially come our way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Adam Kramer: Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Just wanted to ask about the $0.02 kind of benefit or tailwind to the midpoint of the guidance that you included in the bridge from the third-party management. It seems like that's only from kind of the -- kind of formal managing of the 14,000 homes and from any kind of expense savings or other synergies back to the owned portfolio. So I just wanted to ask about maybe kind of what exactly is in that $0.02. And then, again, maybe a little bit bigger picture, taking a step back, what is the opportunity for maybe kind of the rest of this year in terms of adding additional homes to the each of the managed portfolio?
Jonathan Olsen: Thanks, Adam. It's Jon. That's a great question. I think firstly, the $0.02 that we outlined in the bridge, just to be clear, that is the net contribution based on the property management and asset management fees that we will earn net of the incremental cost that we expect to incur to manage those additional 14,000 homes. As far as what the opportunity could be over time and distance, yes, as we talked about, we believe that this will allow us to enhance the efficiency with which we manage our owned portfolio. I would say that those efficiency gains are not factored into our guidance. I think the reality is that we are going to, over time and distance, figure out how do we adjust our gearing model, how do we take advantage of the opportunities to scale, which are going to vary by market, and how do we think about ways to drive incremental opportunity both for us and for those third-party portfolio owners. As far as what it could be down the line, I think time will tell. I would say since we announced this transaction, there have been a number of inbounds from sizable owners of portfolios interested in exploring ways to achieve better operational and financial performance. And that's what we're here for. We're here to drive value for our stakeholders and for our customers by doing what we do, which is leverage the best platform in the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Tricarico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Daniel Tricarico: Hi, good morning. Another guidance question, a few quick related ones. I don't believe you've given this detail so far, but what was the revenue earn-in at the beginning of the year? Where is the loss to lease in the portfolio today? And if you have it, what is the embedded market rent growth for the year?
Jonathan Olsen: Yes. So the earn-in is about 2.5%, 3%. And then, loss to lease, I would say, is high-single digits.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Bradley Heffern: Yes, thank you. Can you talk about how you approach the property tax guide for the year? Obviously, in the past few years, you've been surprised on the millage rate. So does this guide reflect any offset there? Is this purely where you would expect valuations to go?
Jonathan Olsen: Yes, great question. I would say that as we talked about on past calls, we have made some adjustments in terms of how we think about property tax. And I think ultimately, as we've talked about, we are not assuming any improvement in millage rates. I think we are taking a somewhat more conservative approach as I think our experience over the last couple of years warrant. And as we sort of work our way through the year, we'll be able to report back on what we're seeing in a variety of markets. I do think it's important to remember that two of our three biggest markets, we don't actually learn the final answer until fairly late in the year. So I think we want to be mindful of what our experience has been in the last couple of years. And I think that's reflected in our current guide, and that's going to be reflected in how we may or may not adjust that over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keegan Carl from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Keegan Carl: Yes, guys, thanks for the time. So I noticed Pathway sold a home in the quarter, which I believe gives you three total homes sold in the program. Just curious if you could give an update on progress in general, how you see it scaling over time, and what sort of expectations are baked in for more residents potentially buying that home.
Dallas Tanner: It's a great question. Pathways -- and again, we're a minority partner in the platform, so I want to be careful to speak on their behalf. But they're basically taking a cautious approach kind of in the interest rate mortgage cycle that they've been in and have been selectively deploying capital and sort of fine-tuning their business model when and where it matters. They've certainly continue to add homes, a lot in the new construction side of the world as well. But I think that that's a program that we'll continue to develop and get smarter over time. I know they're exploring some opportunities in shared ownership programming and things like that. So we view them as a terrific partner in terms of how we sort of probe the market and understand where the puck is going. And I think as they have more to report on the early wins in terms of the categories and also the products that will lend themselves to kind of the greatest upside, we're certainly keen on getting a little bit smarter and deciding when and where we might want to lean in.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Paolone from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Anthony Paolone: Yes, thanks. I guess, just wanted to understand, you mentioned a high-single-digit loss to lease, but your new lease spreads are kind of flat to down a bit, it seems. So I'm just wondering like how that works. And also, just your thought as the year progresses, like this new renewal spread, the spread between those two numbers, just kind of abnormally wide for, I guess, you guys and multi-family. I'm just trying to think like is there a rent fatigue, like which side kind of goes either up or down, or does that converge?
Charles Young: So, this is Charles. As we talked about, we set ourselves up here at the start of the year with occupancy at 97.5% that we can start to capture that new lease demand that shows up here in February. And so, when you go back, yes, this is in January, a little lower than we've been, but we explained why we did that. That was a conscious effort. But we're set now to start to capture the demand that we expect will historically always shows up in the summer. We'll see where that goes to. But right now, we're already seeing the acceleration. And I think we're in good shape, given our occupancy now, to capture that. That being said, we've also been really holding steady on the renewal side at pretty healthy rates. Again, came down slightly as we were following for occupancy, but we're still seeing steady renewal rates when you go back to anything that's pre-pandemic. And with that loss to lease, that's what gives us the confidence with our current occupancy to try to capture what's in the market. We'll see where it ends up, but we're seeing acceleration from January to February, and we expect that will continue into spring and summer demand.
Operator: Our next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Linda Tsai: Yes, hi. What is the breakdown in the guide between new and renewal?
Jonathan Olsen: Hi, Linda. It's Jon. We actually haven't talked about that, and I think we're going to stick with what we did include in the guide, which is a blend for the year, high-4s, low-5s.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Powell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Anthony Powell: A question on, I guess, the cap rates in the MLS market. Are you seeing any change there? And also, your disposition cap rates still remain pretty low at 1.9%. What's the outlook for that this year?
Dallas Tanner: It certainly feels -- and I'll let Scott add any commentary to this. It certainly feels like we can continue to sell our dispositions back into the MLS kind of in the mid-to-high 3s, low-4s, depending on the marketplace. Again, we have a much -- typically, a much more expensive home than most of our peers. So when we go to market with some of that product, there's massive demand from home buyers. And I think that's a little bit subject to where mortgage rates are at any given time. But that feels like a very accretive way for us to recycle capital. Scott, anything you'd add to that?
Scott Eisen: No, I would just add that we are continuing our dialogue with the national and regional builders, and we just have a growing backlog of opportunities to work with them on buying partial and full community deals. And I think we feel good about where the spread is on potential cap rates for us. And I think it's in a consistent way -- it's clearly, call it, in the high-5s, low-6s in terms of where we think there are opportunities for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jesse Lederman from Zelman. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jesse Lederman: Hi, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong results. Just looking at your estimate for new home deliveries, it looks like 760, 150 more than in 2023, but this becoming more of a focus for you. What's preventing this from being even higher? Is it interest rates? Or are you finding it more challenging to compete with primary home buyers, given the for-sale market is heating back up? In other words, are homebuilders kind of shifting away from selling to rental operators at all because of how strong the for-sale market has been? Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: Good question. I think between me and Scott, we can give a little bit more color on what we're seeing there. I think Scott summed it up nicely, which is our homebuilder pipeline is continuing to grow. Now, we've talked about this over the last couple of years. I think a year or so ago, our deliveries were like 350, 400. This past year, it was 700-plus. We -- the number that you just quoted in the mid-700s is what we have currently on schedule to deliver. We'll certainly see other opportunities in closeouts with some of our current partners and new partners that will happen throughout the year that aren't on schedule would be our best estimate. Those cap rates are typically 6-plus in today's environment. Now, Scott can talk and give a little bit more color, but strategically speaking, we're on the record that we have a terrific partnership with Pulte Homes. We continue to evaluate opportunities. Scott, you're talking to a number of other builders about some other pipeline additions. And I think I mentioned earlier in the call or yesterday with some media, we've got about 1,800 homes under contract, plus or minus another 1,000 that we're close to putting in our pipeline.
Scott Eisen: Yes. And the only thing -- this is Scott. The only thing I would add here is that it's clear in our dialogue with the builders that they are recognizing that this is an important business line for them. And they clearly have their regular way sales that they're doing to individual consumers. But at the same time, they look at having an institutional partner like us across the table for them, gives them the ability to just continue to grow. Think of it like fleet sales that somebody does with an auto company. And we are just another opportunity for them to continue to provide housing to America and for us to be an incremental buyer to give that incremental demand and for them to continue to grow their deliveries and for us to have opportunities to grow our platform as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Stephen Sakwa: Yes, excuse me, thanks. Jon, I just wanted to maybe circle back on some of those controllable expenses and just see if you could provide a little bit more color. Maybe within the 2023 results, what sort of elevated costs did you incur for all this extra move-out and the delinquencies? And trying to just get a feel for the quantification of that savings maybe moving into and how that might keep those controllable expenses down at that low single-digit growth rate.
Jonathan Olsen: Yes, Steve, it's -- I think the main drivers, when you think about how the delinquency backlog flows through the P&L, there's obviously a bit of an impact at the occupancy line. We talked about that last year. I think the other primary areas are things like property admin expense, which is really the property-level legal cost to sort of manage through the process of enforcing the terms of our lease. You've seen substantial growth in 2023 over 2022 in that area. And the other area is sort of turn OpEx. As we've talked about, when we get some of these turns back from homes that had delinquency move-outs, those turns can be 50% more expensive and they can take some number of days longer to work our way through. I think when you look at 2024 versus 2023, I think the important thing is that it's not that those costs are going down, but that we don't anticipate substantial year-over-year increases. Really, the costs are stabilizing. We're going to work to try to improve upon what our experience was last year, but we still got some wood to chop.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. It's [Nick] (ph) here with Eric. Just a quick question on the balance sheet. Was hoping to get your early thoughts on the plans for the $2.5 billion term loan maturing early next year. Will you extend it for another year into 2026? Or would you look to put new swaps in place to refinance with longer-term debt?
Jonathan Olsen: Yes, great question. I would start off by pointing out that, that term loan final maturity is in January of 2026. So it's not a next year event. We don't have any debt reaching final maturity prior to 2026. With respect to the term loan, we are going to be having dialogue. We're already in dialogue with our bank group. And our goal is going to be to recast that facility sometime between now and summer 2025. We'll continue to monitor the rates market as we contemplate the timing of that recast. And at the appropriate time, we'll also look at our swap book to adjust it based on what our pro forma debt maturity schedule might look like. But I will say that in the grand scheme, we feel very comfortable with both our relationship with our bank group. We feel very comfortable with our access to capital. We may not love our current price -- cost of capital on new debt today. But we're going to do what we've always done, which is to be patient, be opportunistic, watch the market, stay in constant dialogue, and when the appropriate time comes, we'll work our way through that term loan, and we'll move on from there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
James Feldman: Great, thanks. Sticking with the balance sheet and a debt question, what are you assuming in guidance in terms of debt paydown this year? I know you can pay down the secured loan early. And I think you have some swaps expiring at the end of this year as well. Can you just talk about exactly what's in guidance?
Jonathan Olsen: Sure. So, in guidance, you have $800 million of bonds outstanding for seven months of 2024 that weren't in place in 2023. So we did that deal in August of last year. That would, on its own, represent about $0.04. And then you're absolutely right, the $640 million 2018-4 securitization is freely pre-payable at any time. We have held off on paying off that debt even following that bond deal because we like having excess cash on hand. It gives us flexibility to use that cash either to retire debt or for growth opportunities. In the current market, I think it's important to point out that we're earning on average about 5.3% on those excess cash balances. And you can compare that to the rate at which we've swapped that 2018-4 securitization, which is around 4.20%. So in our guidance is the assumption based on the forward curve and sort of extrapolating what we think our money market yields could be for timing of when we would pivot to potentially paying off that debt. Now, I think the reality is, we're going to do exactly what I just said in response to the prior question, which is we're going to watch the market and we're going to take what the market gives. So I don't want to give a sense that a specific path forward is prescriptive, but that's how we got to the $0.03 in the bridge.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski from Green Street. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. I'm sorry to belabor this rent growth question, revenue growth guidance, but I'm still confused. Jon, I want to make sure I understand you guys' math on loss to lease and earn-in. So if you just take the midpoint of revenue guidance, 5%, you strip out the benefit of bad debt, you get to low-4%. Then you say lost to lease is high-single digits. I know you only capture a portion of that. And the earn-in is 2.5% to 3%. So how do you not get well above 4% kind of organic revenue growth for this year? Am I misunderstanding you guys' lost to lease and earn-in definition?
Jonathan Olsen: No, I don't think you're misunderstanding, John. I think what it reflects is the fact that we're here in early February. It's early in the year. There's a reason that we present guidance in a range because there are a variety of potential outcomes, both positive and negative, right? And so, I think we are cognizant of the fact that we are entering into what feels like a more normal kind of market rent growth environment between new and renewal rent. We are looking at the pre-pandemic experience as sort of our model for how we think the curve is going to develop over time. But I think, as Dallas said earlier, there is certainly the potential for a little bit of upside there, but we're going to wait and see how the year develops.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Juan Sanabria: All right. Thanks for the time. Just a couple of follow-up questions on guidance. One would be, how do you expect churn or turnover to trend this year relative to last year maybe relative to pre-pandemic? And then, secondly would be just CapEx guidance, what are you assuming in terms of growth rate on a per home basis? Thank you.
Jonathan Olsen: Thanks, Juan. It's Jon. I think from a turnover perspective, similar to our occupancy guide, when we articulated that we expect it to be generally similar to what we saw in 2023, I think the same holds true for turnover in 2024. The reality is, we've still got sort of the tail of the lease compliance backlog to work through. But I think in the grand scheme, we feel very comfortable with the fact that turnover is trending much lower than it was pre-pandemic, and we think that's emblematic of a really strong demand backdrop, a favorable sort of affordability picture relative to homeownership. That should benefit propensity to rent, duration of stay and likelihood of renewal. With respect to CapEx, I think that, that is going to continue to grow at sort of an inflationary rate. I think we have done a particularly good job in making smart asset management decisions about where and when it does make sense to reinvest capital into our portfolio and in places where it does not pencil. What we found is, we can sell those homes into an incredibly liquid end-user market at cap rates inside 4% and then recycle that capital into newer assets that are going to have less of a CapEx demand over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keegan Carl from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Keegan Carl: Yes, guys, thanks for the follow-up. Just curious, did you have any material impact in your Greater Los Angeles area assets from the recent flooding? And if so, was that embedded in your guidance at all?
Charles Young: Yes. This is Charles. You're referring to the atmospheric river event that hit California. Look, we're still in the process of fully assessing, but early indications is that the vast majority of our portfolio really was not impacted. We have some work orders. There are not that many of them. We're getting through them. As you can imagine, it's around landscaping with trees and some roof stuff, but nothing really major, and our teams are great at responding to stuff like this. So we're assessing, but we don't see it as being a major issue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Goldsmith: Hi, guys. Earlier in the call, you made the point that you're seeing more competition in the build-to-rent type product versus the infill. Are you expecting a difference in performance in between your build-to-rent and your infill product? And then, separately, you've talked a little bit about pushing occupancy through the winter months. Is that dissimilar to what you have done in prior years? Thanks.
Charles Young: Yes. I'll take the second question first. The pushing of occupancy is what we've typically done, especially as we've had more experience in the portfolio on what's the best way to operate in a seasonal business, where in the winter and early spring, the demand is lower as you go into the winter and then it picks up going into the spring and summer. Getting full in that period is important because it gives us that position of strength to capture the demand of new lease rent growth. And what's great about renewals, which is the majority of what we do is pretty steady throughout the year. So this is in line with what we've done historically during the pandemic. We did not see that seasonal pattern. And what we're recognizing now is we're back to that seasonal pattern. Going to your first question, look, build-to-rent portfolios, when you take down 100, 200 homes at once, it's like a lease-up, and there's going to be a -- kind of an aggressive stance to get momentum to get that project going. It's a moment in time for that project or those that are within kind of driving distance that you may be competing. My point is the majority of our portfolio that we've acquired over the 10 years is really more infill, closer into job centers. And the majority of the build-to-rent are typically further out. Now we're really smart around what projects we take and how they balance to us. But you have to recognize that when there are a number of build-to-rent projects that are hitting a community or MSA at one time, and we may have other homes there, it has an effect, especially when we're pushing on occupancy. And we wanted to make sure that we got to a place where we could get -- to the second part of this question -- we can get occupied and make sure that we're capturing the best rent growth out there. So it's something that we're going to pay attention to. Scott knows, and team, they are understanding what these build-to-run projects are. But long term, they're fantastic because it's a great experience for the resident, the amenities that come with it. For us, it's going to be less capital on repair and maintenance over the short period of time. So this is a balance that you get with the opportunities to take on build-to-rent projects like this.
Operator: This completes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you. We look forward to seeing many of you in South Florida in a couple of weeks. Please reach out to Scott or Jon with any questions if we can help. Thank you very much. We hope everyone has a great day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-26 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Invitation Homes Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Scott McLaughlin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Scott McLaughlin: Good morning, and welcome. I'm here today from Invitation Homes with Dallas Tanner, Chief Executive Officer; Charles Young, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jon Olsen, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Eisen, Chief Investment Officer.  Following our prepared remarks, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session with our covering sell-side analysts. [Operator Instructions]. During today's call, we may reference our third quarter 2023 earnings release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com.  Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other nonhistorical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those identified. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so.  We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this call. You could find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures in yesterday's earnings release.  I'll now turn the call over to Dallas Tanner, our Chief Executive Officer.
Dallas Tanner: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. At Invitation Homes, we've worked hard to build and enhance our platform over the last dozen years, the foundation of which is our people, our systems and our unmatched scale.  We believe our platform is industry-leading and difficult to replicate and, as a result, offers significant value for our stakeholders, residents and partners. It allows us to drive strong performance across diverse, geographically dispersed assets while delivering meaningful returns. We've invested heavily in our platform to provide the highest level of professional service, flexibility and convenience to our residents, helping them to live in the home, neighborhood and school system of their choice. We're proud of what we have achieved in this regard.  And in addition to the power of our platform, favorable fundamentals have continued to drive strong tailwinds for our business. In particular, these include the continuing supply and demand imbalance we frequently mention. By most estimates, the United States continues to face a housing shortage of several million units. At the same time, the demand for single-family homes for lease continues to remain robust due to favorable demographics, a growing desire for flexibility and convenience and soaring mortgage rates that make leasing one of our homes much more attractive and affordable than owning a similar home.  According to John Burns, it's now over $1,100 a month cheaper to lease than to own on average in our markets. That's over $13,000 a year in savings that our residents can use to help their families thrive while at the same time benefiting from the choice and flexibility of leasing a home. We believe we remain well positioned to meet this growing demand for single-family homes for lease.  In addition, we remain committed to bringing new supply to the marketplace through our extensive homebuilding relationships. Our multichannel growth strategy allows us to nimbly deploy capital across a variety of acquisition channels, which allows us to be opportunistic, depending on the channel that's most attractive in the various real estate cycles.  During the third quarter of 2023, we took advantage of several unique external growth opportunities. This included our previously announced portfolio acquisition of 1,870 wholly owned homes for a contract price of $650 million in July. As we disclosed, we acquired the portfolio at a year 1 yield in the mid-5s. And we anticipate this to grow into the 6s within the next year. Progress to date on marking the portfolio's rents to market, increasing occupancy and selling non-core homes has been right in line with our expectations.  In addition to the large portfolio transaction, we also acquired another 387 wholly owned homes during the third quarter through those various channels at an average cap rate of 6%. We effectively funded these acquisitions through the sale of 397 wholly owned homes at an average disposition cap rate of approximately 4%.  The 200 basis point spread between acquisitions and dispositions once again illustrates our unique ability to accretively recycle capital out of older, higher-dollar value homes and into newer, higher-quality product. We believe our portfolio makeup affords us this opportunity to accretively recycle capital in this way for some time to come.  In closing, I'd like to express my thanks to our dedicated associates. Through their hard work, Invitation Homes has continued to achieve significant milestones and deliver strong financial performance. As we move forward, we remain confident in our ability to navigate these challenges, capitalize on opportunities and leverage our platform in order to drive sustainable growth and value for our stockholders. Thank you for your continued trust and support.  With that, I'll pass the call on to Charles Young, our President and Chief Operating Officer.
Charles Young: Thanks, Dallas. To start, I'd like to echo your comments and thank our associates for delivering another great quarter. This includes the hard work by our teams to smoothly onboard the nearly 1,900 homes we acquired in July. Our premier size and scale help make acquiring large portfolios like this one relatively programmatic while it is our amazing associates who ensure the transition is seamless and the ongoing resident experience is worry-free.  I'll now walk you through our third quarter operating results. Favorable fundamentals and strong execution led to same-store NOI growth of 4% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2023, in line with expectations. Same-store core revenues in the third quarter grew 6% year-over-year. This increase was driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 6.2% as well as a 20 basis point improvement in bad debt.  We're pleased to see progress here for the second consecutive quarter, including within Southern California, where court times have meaningfully improved since the first part of the year. In the meantime, we continue to attract high-quality residents with our great homes and professional service. For the trailing 12 months, our new residents earned a combined household income of over $142,000 a year, representing an average income-to-rent ratio of 5.2x.  The financial strength of our customer is also evidenced by our industry-leading partnership with Esusu that we announced in July. In just a short time, we've helped enroll over 160,000 of our residents onto Esusu's free credit reporting program. About half of these residents have already seen an improvement in their credit score with an average increase of over 20 points.  In addition to attracting high-quality residents, they continue to stay longer with us. Length of stay is an indicator of overall resident satisfaction, which we're pleased to see has increased again this past quarter to an average of 36 months. We believe our premier ProCare service, along with the many convenient and value-add services we offer, help contribute to this longevity.  The newest offering that we have just started to roll out is bundled Internet. We're excited to partner with one of the nation's largest providers to offer high-speed Internet and digital media to over 1/3 of our residents across the country. Once again, our scale allows us to provide this essential service at a substantial discount to what our residents might otherwise pay on their own.  Turning back to our same-store results. Third quarter 2023 core expenses increased 10.2% year-over-year. This included year-over-year increases of 11.7% in fixed expenses and 8% in controllable expenses, the latter of which was primarily driven by an increase in turnover compared to the historic lows of last year, along with the cost related to the progress we're making on our lease compliance backlog.  Next, I'll cover same-store leasing trends in the third quarter. Demand in our markets remained strong through the end of peak leasing season. As we've noted previously, we are seeing a return to more normal seasonality, which we believe represents a much healthier and sustainable footing following the extraordinary market rent growth we saw in the past 2 years.  Nevertheless, our third quarter 2023 same-store leasing results are still well above pre-pandemic norms. This includes average occupancy in the third quarter of 96.9%, or 120 basis points higher than our 2018 and 2019 third quarter averages. In addition, blended rent growth in the third quarter of 2023 was 6.2%, or 170 basis points higher than our 2018/2019 third quarter averages.  Third quarter 2023 blended rent growth of 6.2% was comprised of renewal rent growth of 6.6% and new lease rent growth of 5.2%. We're pleased to have seen an acceleration in renewal rent growth each month in the third quarter of 2023. Renewal rent growth is further accelerating with October's preliminary results. This represents a strong performance for the third quarter that is once again attributable to our outstanding associates.  As we approach the end of the year, we remain focused on continuing this momentum and finish the year strong. I'm proud of our teams for their tremendous contributions this past quarter and the great effort I know they will deliver during the remainder of the year.  I'll now turn the call over to Jon Olsen, our Chief Financial Officer.
Jonathan Olsen: Thanks, Charles. Today, I'll cover the following topics: first, an update on our investment-grade rated balance sheet; second, financial results for the third quarter; and finally, updated 2023 full year guidance.  I'll begin with our balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.8 billion in available liquidity through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.5x as of the end of the third quarter, at the low end of our targeted 5.5x to 6x range.  Our outstanding borrowings carried a weighted average interest rate of 3.8%. And we have no debt reaching final maturity until 2026. Over 75% of our total debt is unsecured and over 99% of our debt is fixed rate or swapped to fixed rate.  In August, we closed on an $800 million dual-tranche public bond offering comprised of $450 million of 7-year notes at a 5.45% coupon and $350 million of 10-year notes at a 5.5% coupon. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the $150 million we drew on our revolver in July with the remaining net proceeds serving as additional dry powder for growth or future debt repayment while earning an attractive deposit yield from our banks in the meantime.  In August, as a result of our strong balance sheet and continued access to capital, we were pleased to see Fitch upgrade its ratings outlook for the company from stable to positive and affirm our BBB flat rating.  Next, I'll briefly touch on our financial results. Third quarter core FFO per share increased 4.7% year-over-year to $0.44, primarily due to an increase in NOI. Third quarter AFFO per share increased 3.7% year-over-year to $0.36.  The last thing I'll cover is our updated 2023 full year guidance. Our third quarter year-to-date results have generally been in line with our expectations. With a little over 2 months remaining in the year, last night's release included a tightening of most of our guidance expectations.  This includes a narrowed range for full year 2023 same-store NOI growth of 4.5% to 5%, which is based on a narrowed range for same-store core revenue growth of 6.25% to 6.75% and revised same-store core expense growth of 10.25% to 10.75%. The expected increase in same-store core expense growth guidance is based primarily on a higher same-store property tax expense expectations in Florida and Georgia.  While the fundamentals that have favored housing are well known to us, we originally anticipated property tax millage rates in both Florida and Georgia would decline to at least partially offset some of the unprecedented home price appreciation that's occurred there. Based on the property tax bills we've received or expect to receive during the fourth quarter, that's not been the case and causes us to now expect full year same-store property tax expense growth of approximately 10% to 10.5%.  Our updated guidance also tightens the ranges of expected core FFO per share and AFFO per share. We now expect full year 2023 core FFO per share in a range of $1.75 to $1.79, or 6% growth year-over-year at the midpoint, and full year 2023 AFFO per share in a range of $1.46 to $1.50.  With that, we have now concluded our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.
Michael Goldsmith: My question seeks to frame the factors that caused the deceleration in occupancy and the slowdown in lease rent. So how much is attributable to normal seasonality, a return to more long-term pre-COVID averages, lease compliance and moderating underlying demand? I guess, where is the business structurally better now? And where is it reverting back to pre-COVID averages?
Charles Young: Yes, thanks for the question. This is Charles here. Now look, I think as you laid out, we're seeing seasonality that we expected. I think we've signaled this all year. Coming off of the pandemic times, which are kind of heady in terms of rent growth and occupancy, we expected that the end of the year, we'd see this more typical seasonality. And let's level set a little bit on what that means.  What that means is new lease kind of goes a bell curve throughout the year with peak being around June or July. And so historically, we've always seen kind of going down that bell curve in August and September as the end of the move-in season happens. Because typically, your summer is when you're getting the turnover and people are moving in. And that's why you get the real pop in the new lease rent growth.  And the peak may vary. But at the end of the day, that downturn, if you will, on the bell curve is August and September. So if you look back pre COVID, and I went back to prior to the pandemic times, that new lease range was around 1.5% to 3.5%. And for our September, we're right around 3% or just below. So this is normal. What's not normal is renewals, on the other hand, historically stayed steady throughout the year.  And so we've been there, but we're running a little warmer than we've seen historically. If you look back pre COVID, renewal rate was around 3% to 5%. Now our September renewal rate is 6.9%. What that tells you is we still are in this really strong fundamentals of the business, where there's high demand, an undersupply of homes, we're leasing well.  And I would add to it that we have, as we expected, a little higher turnover this year, given our lease compliance backlog work. You put all that together, we're in really normal seasonality that we would expect. And Q3 being at 96.9% occupancy, if you go back to those years I was talking about, we weren't this high.  So we're combining really nice blended overall rent growth for this time of the year, really high occupancy and kind of a return to normal seasonality with strong fundamentals kind of driving the business. So I feel good where we are. And I understand how it may seem like it's different. But at the end of the day, we had 2 years that were just abnormal, and we're going back to more typical season.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi.
Eric Wolfe: So I appreciate that visibility on 2024 taxes is probably really low at this point. But just trying to understand whether you think it's going to be sort of another year of very aggressive tax increases or if the moderation that you've seen in home prices this year will result in a similar moderation of taxes. And just historically, if you look at in a given year, the degree of change in home prices, is that a good predictor of what next year should look like in terms of tax increases?
Jonathan Olsen: Thanks for the question. It's Jon. While we're not prepared to talk about 2024 at this time, I think you really hit the nail on the head when you tied together what's been happening with asset appreciation, what's been happening with home values and what the outsized year-over-year property tax expense growth has been for the last 2 years.  I think it's interesting, if you look over a trailing 5-year period, our annual same-store property tax growth averaged around 5.5%. But within that time period, 2021 was sort of an outlier to the low side. So I think we've seen a bit of a catch-up factor. As we look and think about property tax, we've always been pretty good at predicting where values were going to come in. Values haven't been the problem for us.  The challenge for us is that we have assumed that as values increase, and those increases have been substantial, that we would see some degree of relief on millage rates. That was our experience over much of our history. That is what we expected last year. Obviously, it didn't come to pass. This year, we did not expect that same pattern to unfold.  So as it turned out, I think the revenue need in municipal budgets was greater than we anticipated, probably based on inflation. And we saw little to no relief on millage rates in Georgia and Florida. So as we look to 2024, we're going to be reassessing how we think about property tax. I think we'll be less reliant on what our historical experience has been, at least for the intervening period. But as I said, we're not prepared to give a sense for 2024. We'll talk about '24 in February.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.
Jeffrey Spector: I just want to, I guess, clarify the comments on seasonality and how we should think about that heading into the fourth quarter, what that may mean for new lease rate growth. And maybe you could talk about historically what you would normally now see, let's say, from September to October, from 3Q into 4Q. Like what should we be expecting?
Charles Young: Yes. As I described, the new lease kind of bell curve goes up and down through the year and goes into Q4 and will kind of bottom out and then go into Q1 and build up later on. Where we will kind of low point will be, it's hard to predict. But we're still seeing good demand. We have high occupancy. As you look at that, some of that is we are trying to drive towards what we know are kind of the healthy occupancy, given our low turnover at this point.  And so that will be kind of the balance there. But I don't expect it will go much lower than we are right now. And we'll see where it goes. I think the strength is on our renewals, as I talked about. Again, we're seeing acceleration from September into October, as I mentioned. And keep in mind that given our low turnover, 75% of our newly -- of our leasing business is renewals. And so that really does drive our overall results. So seasonality is -- on the new lease side is a part of the business.  It actually -- we look at it and welcome it because it brings us to a more normal period that we're used to. And we understand how that works. And when you look at the blend throughout the year, we're really strong. And our blend is much higher than we've been historically pre COVID as well. So business is in good stead. And I expect we'll -- Q4 is where new leases kind of bottom. And then we go into Q1, we'll start to bounce out of there and go while I'm feeling good around our renewals, given our loss to lease and overall low turnover.
Operator: The next question comes from James Feldman with Wells Fargo.
James Feldman: So if I could just grab a quick rebound off of Jeff's question, which is can you talk about new lease rates in October? But my question is actually, you had talked about 4% yields on your cap rates on your asset sales versus 6% on acquisitions. I mean, how sustainable is it? We've got the 10-year treasury at 5%, mortgage rate is high. I mean, how sustainable is it to keep that 4% sales yield or cap rate or even your 200 basis point spread, given how much rates have moved and just where the market looks today?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. This is Dallas. And look, as we look at the overall landscape of the marketplace, there's no doubt that the elevated mortgage rate and mortgage rate environment is certainly shifting behaviors in the home buying and selling arena. Now our view of that landscape currently is, as Charles pointed out, it's probably going to impact to the positive our renewals business because there is less transaction availability in the marketplace overall.  The lock-in effect and things that we're hearing as we talk with economists out there and homebuilders, and we obviously have a lot of great relationships there, is very real. And I think the resale environment is evidenced by, I think, NAR's number on annualized sales are predicting somewhere around 4 million, which is off by like 30% in terms of how you think of normal transaction volumes.  What does that mean for the rental business? And I think, by and large, if you look at all the data, there are less single-family homes for rent on market today than there were 2 or 3 years ago. Many homes get sold back in as MLS inventory. And candidly, it's not enough. And I think what we've experienced, we see it on both sides of the transaction, right? We are active in the MLS market as a buyer trying to buy assets at what we think are clearing price of capital is at any given point.  We are not finding a lot of transactions in that environment because we get outbid. And so there is ample demand for homes in the marketplace on a resale basis as evidenced in the data that we have around selling. And that's been really consistent. So we feel really comfortable. As Jon talked about before, our values are up dramatically over the last several years.  As we go to sell homes in the market, we're having little to no problem selling a home for any particular reason that we deem from an asset management perspective. And we're selling those at really great marks. And then being able to accretively invest that capital back into homes at much higher cap rates, as we talked about in the release, we view as a very good capital allocation strategy for our business going forward.  We're selling older homes, maybe they have some form of CapEx risk and generally recycling those into newer homes with very little CapEx long-term risk at much better yields on cost. So I don't know the answer as to how long that can -- that market can be out there. But it feels like there is a homebuyer market even at today's mortgage rates, albeit it's much more muted. However, the absolute lack of supply in the marketplace is a very real factor. And we don't see that changing anytime soon.
Operator: The next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Austin Wurschmidt: You guys have highlighted some of the unique challenges this year from kind of normalizing conditions. And you've had tough year-over-year comps in lease rate growth. You've had the lease compliance backlog to work through and just higher turnover. I guess, are those challenges behind us? And when you referenced occupancy and lease rate growth above the 2018 and 2019 period, do you expect you can sustain occupancy above those periods as well as lease rate growth, given some of the tailwinds to the business?
Jonathan Olsen: Yes, I'll let Charles speak to the occupancy piece. But I think as far as your question, if I heard you right, are we through this transitional period? I think the short answer is not yet. Charles and his team have been doing yeoman's work on the ground. We're really pleased with the progress we've made working through our delinquency backlog. Quarter-over-quarter, bad debt was down 20 basis -- sorry, year-over-year, bad debt was down 20 basis points, but rental assistance was down 80%.  So the health of our customer as we get those homes released is quite strong if you look at our income-to-rent ratio. So I think we've still got a little bit of wood to chop. Certain of our markets have been able to move more quickly than others. But we're certainly heartened by the fact that it seems as though court systems are now moving a little bit more quickly. California, in particular, is becoming a little bit easier to navigate.  But it's going to take us a little bit of time yet before we truly can say we've returned to normal. But I think the results that we've posted and what we're seeing in our portfolio in light of that transitional experience we've been going through all year, I think, really underscores what a great business we have and how strong the underlying fundamentals are.
Charles Young: Yes, this is Charles. I'll just add a couple of thoughts. You're asking around some of the tailwinds. Look, there's more positive that we're seeing. We knew for this year, we had the least compliance backlog to go through and it was going to elevate turnover temporarily. Given that backdrop though, we've had tremendous new lease rent growth all year long. We're just returning to normal seasonality, as I discussed.  We've been in occupied north of 97% all year long. Q3, normal seasonality, 96.9%. As I look at the portfolio going forward, this is what typically happens, Q4 will bottom out on occupancy and start to rise back up. And we are doing this in a backdrop where we've had higher turnover that will ultimately start to -- we see it as transitory and start to normalize as we go into next year.  So there's a lot of really good things going on. And we're seeing good -- still seeing really good demand across the way. Again, it's around the balance of new lease and renewals. And just to highlight the renewals, for November, we went out at over 9% for November and December on new lease -- renewal asks. So ultimately, I think that leads to the steadiness of the business, the demand that we have.  And ultimately, I think it puts us in a more kind of stable footing that we know what to expect, especially as we work through this lease compliance backlog. And as Jon said, many of our markets are back to normal. We're still working through it in a few markets like Atlanta and California and a couple of others. And once we do that, then those tailwinds will get even better as easier comps for next year.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore.
Stephen Sakwa: I guess, I've got a -- just a follow-up because I'm getting hit by a few people on this number and just trying to nail this down. You've been very clear about where, I guess, renewals are coming in and where they're going out. But it seems like there's a little bit more opaqueness on the new leasing. So Charles, I think you said that historically this time of year, the range would normally be in kind of the 1.5% to maybe 3% range. So are you in that range for, say, October? And are you kind of towards the higher end of the range or the lower end of the range? Because I think folks are just trying to get their arms around where new leasing is today.
Charles Young: All right. Very good. This is Charles. Look, we are -- the month is not over for October. So this is all preliminary on both numbers. We are comfortably in that range. And it will be what we expect to be, above 2%, for October. We'll see where it settles out. But that again is normal in terms of the seasonality and also given a little bit of elevated turnover, given the seasonality and what we're doing on the lease compliance backlog.  So I like where we are. And I think if you're looking ahead, it's the renewals that should give a lot more optimism. Given that the new lease is only 25% of what we do on our leases, the renewals is what's going to drive the blend as we go forward and keep our occupancy steady and high.
Operator: The next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.
Juan Sanabria: Just on the lease compliance or COVID era issues, when do you think we'll work through that? And do you have a sense of what the expense profile would be if those items -- if those homes that churn over is kind of stripped out, just to think about what the cost growth would normalize to once that debt is cleared out?
Jonathan Olsen: Juan, it's Jon. That's a good question. I think a couple of things to bear in mind. Historically, bad debt for us has run, give or take, 50 basis points if you go back to the pre-COVID period. For the third quarter, we came in at 133 basis points, which was down materially from what our experience has been over the last several quarters. So we're absolutely heartened by that.  We do believe that over time and distance, we can get back to those pre-pandemic levels. That said, it's hard to predict the timing. There are a lot of factors that come into play. Certain of those factors are out of our control in terms of how quickly courts can work through their backlogs. The various steps in the process of resolving those delinquency issues can sometimes take longer than we would hope. That said, I think we do see a path to a return to normalcy.  I think the other thing I would note is turnover has been elevated for all the reasons Charles talked about. I think roughly 19% of our move-outs in the third quarter were related to skips or eviction move-outs. That's up, I think, 400 basis points year-over-year. And those skip and evict turns can cost 50% more than a regular way turn.  So if you adjust for sort of the -- both the elevated turnover, the higher cost of a larger subset of those turns, the fact that those skip and evict turns on average are going to take a few days longer, which has an additional impact on occupancy beyond the impact of turnover already, I think when you put it all together, we feel really good that as we continue this march towards a return to normal, if you will, that we see a path to getting back to a portfolio that operates in a manner very similar to what we experienced before the sort of anomalous last few years of COVID.
Operator: The next question comes from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.
Adam Kramer: Just wanted to kind of talk about the -- kind of the cash on the balance sheet. I know you did the debt offering in the quarter. I think cash is kind of sitting higher than it has historically as a result. You took up the kind of the acquisition guidance by a little bit.  I think it only kind of implies maybe, I think, $100 million or so of acquisitions from here on the wholly owned side. So maybe just walk us through kind of what the opportunity set is like in terms of acquisitions now. And just in terms of the capital deployment, anything else that we're maybe not thinking about that some of that cash can be used for?
Dallas Tanner: This is Dallas. Great question on the environment. I think we're -- and I'll let Jon speak a little bit around how we're thinking about cash as I finish. I think we want to stay in a position of strength. And the goal would be to make sure that we have as much flexibility between cash, our JV businesses, our pipeline with new construction, which continues to be an interesting area for us as we continue to evaluate better opportunities and then ultimately also being ready for some additional hopeful M&A over the next couple of years as smaller portfolios sort of get in a position where they have a decision tree moment and have to make a decision based on the capital markets, maybe in availability that's out there.  And so look, while we don't have anything pressing or current and we just digested 1,800 homes that we did last quarter, we certainly want to be ready if or when the opportunities come in front of us. We are still seeing opportunities out there with significant embedded loss to lease from some of the other smaller portfolios. We're having sort of the inbounds that I've talked about at Nareit in June. And we still continue to see sort of what-if type of moments. I think people are still trying to get their heads around where those opportunities are if you're a seller.  As I mentioned earlier on the call, we do not see the MLS as a big source of opportunistic external growth for our business. We prefer to continue to stack a bunch of this newer product at pretty meaningful discounts to where kind of they're selling in neighborhoods and being able to sort of insulate our balance sheet, so to speak, with newer product, less CapEx risk while we sell older assets at really updated marks.  So I think from an external growth perspective, just keeping our options open, making sure that we have plenty of cash available, Jon can talk more about what we're doing with that cash, and then also just making sure that we're keeping our eyes out on just any and all kind of balance sheet activity that could be available to us.
Jonathan Olsen: Yes, Adam. With respect to cash, I mean, the thing that feels really good at the moment is the fact that we can sell assets at a 4% cap, put the cash in the bank and earn 5.35%, right? So we don't need to have an immediate sort of capital redeployment opportunity. We can basically park the cash, and it is still accretive, up until such a point that we find something that is interesting to go after on the acquisition side. So in this moment in time, being liquid, having a lot of capital just makes sense to us, right? So a portion of that cash on the balance sheet is, if not directly earmarked, it's certainly, in our minds, circled to take care of one of our 2026 maturities, which is the $615 million 2018 for securitization. But I think all things considered, right now, we want to maximize flexibility. We want to maximize optionality. And that means sort of having as much dry powder on hand, particularly if holding that cash is accretive. It just makes sense.
Operator: The next question comes from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research.
Keegan Carl: Just wondering if you could provide any color on recent news that you're entering property management, given the articles that came out.
Dallas Tanner: We appreciate the question. We have nothing to report. By nature, we don't comment on speculation. We've said in the past that with the strength of our platform, we're going to continue to look for opportunities, find ways to grow that can both be capital-light and accretive and also look for areas where we can actually leverage the platform to enhance our own operating margins. But as of today, we have nothing to report.
Operator: The next question comes from Buck Horne with Raymond James.
Buck Horne: Following up on that, I was just wondering if you could maybe comment on your thoughts on expanding joint venture relationships or any partnerships there. And also, your thoughts on working with homebuilders, if there's any interest or you're finding any availability with builders to do more build-for-rent communities.
Dallas Tanner: Buck, thanks for the question. On the second one around builders, yes, I mean, we are definitely -- we have existing relationships already with some of the bigger builders in the country that I think everybody on this call is aware of. Those relationships have been excellent for us. I hope they've been equally as excellent for them. We are all looking to expand those pipelines and create additional, what we would call, deal flow through the channel of partnering with our homebuilder partners. And just by sort of a way of kind of reminding everyone, one of the things we love about that, just call it C of O, C of O-plus-type relationship is we get meaningful discounts. We can put sort of limited deposits out there. And we manage that business in that pipeline, which today sits at roughly $1 billion or more, in a way that is very effective and efficient for us. As we look for other opportunities, I think one of the areas that we've been pretty vocal on, especially in light of where the capital markets are treating equity prices for REITs, is doing more in and around ventures with partners that are sophisticated and also have sort of the same ambition around the single-family space that we do. And so we don't -- while we don't have anything sort of new to announce on that front, we are always having inbounds and active dialogues with potential partners. One of the areas of which that seems to be the most appealing is around our new construction business.  And that, to me, feels like a natural fit for us as we continue to build out our JV businesses over time that we could bring on strategic capital and still be a partner with them with our balance sheet capital, to Jon's point, and put meaningful opportunities to work over time. And I think that business will continue to develop and evolve for us. And we'll obviously keep everybody posted if or when there's anything to talk about there as well.
Operator: The next question comes from Daniel Tricarico with Scotiabank.
Daniel Tricarico: Question on the JV acquisition guidance coming down, Dallas, can you talk to what you're hearing from your partners and how their outlooks or expectations have changed over the last 90 days?
Dallas Tanner: I just think there's been honest conversations around where the clearing price of capital is. And I think that has more to do with where the debt capital markets are or aren't as they've shifted. It feels like it's sort of a new conversation every 30 or 40 days in terms around where debt facilities are. I mean, if you look at the deal Jon and the team did in August in the bond market, we had basically a blended cost on that $800 million of around 5.5%. And I think that market is far different today, being 60 days later.  And so as we think about where we would need to be as a partnership either with our own capital being partnered with theirs or if we were to just do things on-balance sheet, like where is sort of our strike price? And it definitely feels like it's in today's world in the 6s. We've talked about that in the last earnings calls. We're looking for accretive opportunities that are sort of in the 6s on a yield on cost for us today. And being outside of that, I think capital is willing and able. I think capital market is less so willing at times. And that's what we're trying to sort of navigate through right now.
Operator: The next question comes from Alan Peterson with Green Street.
Alan Peterson: Charles, I was just wondering, what markets are you seeing the most concession usage across the portfolio today? And what's the average concession being offered? As you kind of stare out to the end of the year, are you anticipating needing to dial up concessions to build back occupancy into year-end?
Charles Young: Yes. So we ran no concessions through Q3. But as we're looking at the landscape now, and to your point, thinking about occupancy and trying to go into 2024 on a solid footing, we're looking to go selectively while the market is still kind of pumping. We feel the demand is here. But things slow down typically on the holidays. And so I would expect that we'll run some select concessions in markets that have been a little softer.  As I look around Vegas, I've talked about this before, it softened a little bit. We're seeing a little bit of softness in Phoenix lately. Those two markets sometimes run similarly. But a lot of it will be around thinking about homes that may be on the market a little longer. And so we'll try to move that product. So it's a balance.  And it's really, just to your point, around trying to make sure that we are in good footing going into the start of the year. At 96.9% occupancy, I expect October to kind of be at that same level, plus/minus, and then will rise from here. That's what typically happens in the seasonality. And we want to push to get that back over 97% as fast as we can. And that's how we'll use concessions as need be.
Operator: The next question comes from Tyler Batory with Oppenheimer.
Tyler Batory: A follow-up question on your builder relationships. Can you remind us what your underwriting for cap rates in that channel? And then when you look at some of the homes that you've taken down already, especially from Pulte, with that relationship, can you talk a little bit about lease-up trends, maybe you're getting better unit economics on those assets and comparable homes?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. On your latter point, and while we don't have any specifics we're releasing, I'd just tell you that we are -- we've generally really outperformed underwritten rents on the communities as we've taken them in. I think Scott shared that on some of our Investor Days and things that he's held out at some of the different communities as they've onboarded. And I just mentioned before, it sort of feels like the market today needs to be somewhere in the 6s to have it really want to make sense as you start to measure absorption risk and new construction pricing and the like.  But to be fair, that shift mix can vary by market-to-market. And we're total return investors at the end of the day. So we're looking for, one part, asset appreciation going-in basis on cost or how we think about replacement costs in a way that feels like measured risk. And then we need to have convictions around where we see demographic trends going because we believe that's ultimately a proxy for where rents go.  And I think as you look at our business, the one thing that we have fundamentally more and more conviction around, the customer today with us this quarter is staying almost 36 years as you average that across the portfolio. That is a much stronger -- did I say 36 years? 36 months, excuse me. I wish it was 36 years. But 36 months is meaningful.  As Jon talked about turnover and the costs that are associated with it. And as you look at our business in that demographic window, the average customer between 38 and 39 years old, we have a massive pipeline of customers potentially coming into our business. And many of them want to live in a new community with brand-new schools. And that to us is a winning value proposition for our business.
Operator: The next question comes from Jesse Lederman with Zelman & Associates.
Jesse Lederman: Are you hearing or seeing any impacts from rising apartment availability across any of your markets that might be keeping renters in the multifamily asset class for longer than they otherwise would be, recognizing that the new multifamily supply is largely catered toward luxury products and any concessions offered by apartment operators might make the value proposition for apartments versus single-family rentals more attractive?
Charles Young: Yes, it's a good question. I think I'd start with the majority of our renters come from single family. So there's not a lot of overlap. It's somewhere around -- the number that are coming from historically that have been coming from multifamily is 10% or less. And so it will vary market-by-market in terms of the size of the market. But generally, we'll not see that have a direct impact on us and -- but we'll pay attention to it.  I think a couple of years ago, we felt it a bit in South Florida, when there was a bunch of condo product out there. And so I think again, each market will have its own nuances. But given that most of our folks are families, pets, looking for school districts, having a backyard and having extra space for a Zoom call, all of these things drive people that are looking for single-family homes, as Dallas said, moving their kids for the good schools. That's the driver.  And so the multifamily isn't a direct competitor most of the time. And that's not in all the cases. But generally, we're looking at kind of the mom-and-pops that are out there that are offering homes. And that's been our main competitor throughout. And what we know is, given our marketing kind of platform and universe, we do well against that, given our professional ProCare service and all that we provide.
Operator: The next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
Bradley Heffern: Jon, I was wondering if you could give the size of the true-up for the under-accrued property taxes that fell into the fourth quarter. I think the implied growth guidance for the fourth quarter is roughly 6.5% for OpEx. Just wondering what that figure would have been without the out-of-period taxes.
Jonathan Olsen: Well, I think -- for the fourth quarter, I think the reasonable expectation is that year-over-year Q4 property taxes will be up between 6.5% and maybe 7.25%. I think that's the right way to think about it.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.
Anthony Paolone: I guess, along the same lines, if -- given what's happened on the property tax side and just insurance this year, if we're thinking about the full year impact and starting to think about '24, can you maybe just help us with any brackets? Like are there enough levers to even bring expenses down into a more normalized growth range next year? Or does the full year impact really just keep these up such that your OpEx is going to run high again for another year?
Jonathan Olsen: Thanks for the question, Tony. As I said, we're not in a position where we're going to start talking about '24 yet. I think we are going to evaluate everything in totality. I think when we are prepared to talk about 2024 in February, we will give you a sense for what our expectations are around both of those line items. Because look, we certainly understand that we have seen outsized growth in both of those over the last few years.  And I think as we take a step back and think about where we are, we are in the midst of a return to "normalcy." I think there have been a lot of factors in our business and other businesses that have had some temporary structural impacts that are going to take some time to resolve. How long that is, I think, remains to be seen. And we'll be happy to chat about that a little bit more when we release our '24 guidance.
Operator: The next question comes from Jade Rahmani with KBW.
Jason Sabshon: This is actually Jason Sabshon on for Jade. So at current cap rates, what do you think the IRR is on single-family rental acquisitions over a 5- to 7-year hold? And do you view that as attractive? And separately, what's your outlook for home prices over the next year?
Dallas Tanner: I think as you look at going-in cap rates, reasonable assumptions around home price appreciation, in our markets, it feels like on an unlevered basis, you could certainly be in the high single digits, low double digits based on sort of the returns that we're seeing out there. I think that, obviously, that equation sort of depends on your inputs around leverage over time.
Operator: The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: Dallas, you mentioned earlier the portfolio still has, I guess, more of an opportunity to generate accretion from asset recycling, selling older assets to buy new ones. Could you maybe put some broad brackets around that opportunity? Do you see that as perhaps 10%, 20%, 30% of the portfolio? And how much large of a role should we expect for disposition to play in funding your business near term?
Dallas Tanner: Haendel, good question. One of the things, and Jon mentioned it, is we have sort of a high-class problem right now. And it's that we have assets that have really good valuations to them, a market that is starved for product if you're selling a home. But we also have a business that's got really amazing growth fundamentals behind it. And so anytime homes come up for a renewal where we reprice, we call it, a rebuy analysis and we look at the portfolio as a whole, and there's a lot of different reasons for holding an asset, and there's a lot -- there can be several different factors to why you may consider selling an asset.  I think in today's environment, with equity being so precious, I think if there are opportunities to recycle capital, expect us to be probably a little bit more aggressive there. And we've certainly shown that the last couple of years. I think the company itself generally has gotten really good high marks for being good capital allocators. We've sold probably 13,000, 14,000 homes back into the market over the last decade. And we look at the U.S. single-family housing market as the most liquid asset class in the world. And there -- our homes are generally located in areas where if we want to sell that home, there are a lot of buyers as well as there normally would be a lot of renters for that home.  And so that's a high-class problem. I think we'll evaluate our capital opportunities over time. If we think that, that makes sense to keep recycling because of sort of the spreads between where values are and where we can reinvest accretively, expect us, as I mentioned before, to be a little bit more aggressive there. But in terms of issuing like a guidance on that, we'll update our thinking in February again. We did that at the beginning of this year. We've been a little bit more of a seller relative to what we laid out at the beginning of the year. And that's been based on the market opportunity.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays.
Anthony Powell: Could you update us on your views on the risk of shadow supply and mortgage rate lock-in? I think this comes up from time-to-time, question to us. With mortgage rate at 8%, people may want to hold on to their current mortgage for longer. Do you expect to see more supply from, I guess, accidental landlords going forward? And is that something that you underwrite when you buy properties or when you look for developments?
Dallas Tanner: My own view is that, just based on conversations we're having with both economists and homebuilders, it certainly feels like mortgage rate sensitivity has been more of a factor for people. Builders have had, obviously, tremendous success in buying down mortgage rate. And they've been able to do that for the better part of the last year, 1.5 years.  As these rates get more and more elevated based on where the 10-year and sort of treasuries are, I would expect that, that probably increases people's willingness to stay locked in, in a home that they currently own. I was looking at this the other day, and I think it's still somewhere around 80% of the country is still at a sub-5% mortgage rate. And we talk about this in our earnings release. It's about $13,000 a year cheaper to rent a home right now, an Invitation home, than it is to go out and buy.  And I don't see that changing in the near term. If anything, I think, with this higher-for-longer period that people keep referring to, it sort of seems like the new reality right now. And I think it's probably a really good thing for those in our business in terms of the inherent demand that Charles talked about. And I think we're probably seeing some of that in the elevated renewal rates that are still sticking around through Q3 and likely into Q4.
Operator: Our final question comes from James Feldman with Wells Fargo.
James Feldman: I just wanted to go back to your comments on JV opportunities and fee opportunities. So if you were to expand the JV platform meaningfully, would you think about entering new markets, maybe new home types? Or do you think you kind of stick with the exact same strategy you have and types of markets you have? And then similarly, if you think about the -- if you do more kind of fee management, is that purely just a fee collection business? Or do you take equity stakes in those types of portfolios as well?
Dallas Tanner: To your question on markets -- this is Dallas. To your question on markets, we love the markets we're in. I think one of the reasons that we've had the sort of performance that we've had historically, and we've been one of the top 5 -- we've had probably the best numbers in the residential space the last 5 years running, is in large part because we've been very deliberate about where we invest capital and why. And if you look at our concentrations, we've been in some of the highest-growth parts of the country, and I wouldn't expect us to change that philosophy.  In addition, I think one of the reasons we get the operating margins that we do, and right now we're in the high 60s and we have markets that are well into the 70s, is because of our focus on scale, density and being able to lay out services that people are going to want for longer periods of time. And so as we continue to focus on being in not just the right states but the right markets within those states and then building out scale and product density that allows you to meaningfully impact your service model, that is a winning proposition for Invitation Homes over the long term. And don't expect us to change from that. Now to your question around product type, we've certainly experimented a little bit as we've done more and more infill with some townhome-type product and some product that was a little bit higher density. One of the purchases we made in Q3 was a community like that in Arizona. That was a little bit higher-density product, really good location, right off a meaningful transportation quarter in the west side of Phoenix.  I think you could see us continue to try to experiment a little bit on townhome-type product. But remember, square footage matters and amenities matter in those situations. We certainly aren't an apartment investment -- an apartment investor today doing 800 to 1,000 square foot units. That's not our business. We want to be 1,500, 1,600, 1,700 square feet minimum and preferably a little bit bigger than that. That lends to the demographic that we think we cater to the best. In terms of your question around fee management, look, I think you've seen us as a company over the first decade prove out a couple of things. One, we have an ability to take on scale in a meaningful way time and time again and integrate that into our platform and see margin expansion in our numbers. We've done that last quarter with the 2,000 units we added with that trade meaningfully. It will add to additional scale and density and what we believe will be margin expansion over time. I think as we start to consider things around -- we get the question around property management and as we've expanded our JV businesses, we want to look for things that are accretive, that are going to give us scale but that won't take away from the disciplined approach we already have to our business. And so if it has scale, if it's meaningful and if it can actually lend to our own operating margins in a way that we think that our business becomes more profitable, especially in a capital-light way, those are things we're going to look at in the future and continue to evaluate. So focused on controlling the controllables right now within our business. I feel like Charles talked about this. Our business from a controllable perspective is running really, really well. I think as we get through some of this near-term noise and what we call kind of the pandemic transitory winds of property tax and bad debt, our business is set up for success for the future. And we feel really good about where we are.
Operator: This completes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: We want to thank everyone again for joining us today. And we're going to look forward to seeing many of you again in a couple of weeks at Nareit. Thanks again.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Invitation Homes Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Scott McLaughlin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Scott McLaughlin: Good morning, and welcome. I'm here today from Invitation Homes with Dallas Tanner, Chief Executive Officer; Charles Young, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jon Olsen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with our covering sell-side analysts. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and then re-queue if you'd like to ask a follow-up question. During today's call, we may reference our second quarter 2023 earnings release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures in yesterday's earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Dallas, our Chief Executive Officer.
Dallas Tanner: Good morning. And thanks for joining us. These continue to be exciting times with Invitation Homes once again demonstrating our ability to deliver strong results. Fundamentals remain very favorable for our industry and in particular for our markets product and price points. Our teams are providing a great resident experience every day and we continue to seek and find fantastic value creation opportunities through our sound capital allocation strategy. I'd like to discuss a few of these in more detail during my prepared remarks with you today. First, let's begin with value creation and our recent purchase of nearly 1,900 single family rental homes for approximately $650 million. As we've demonstrated over the last 11 years, we approached external growth opportunities with a strategic, disciplined and accretive focus. And I'm pleased to share with you why we believe this transaction continues in that approach. Essentially, this is a high growth portfolio of exceptionally well-located homes that we bought at a pretty attractive price. We believe our purchase price represents a meaningful discount to end-user market values, giving us immediate benefits of scale, a value that would have been impossible to replicate through one-off buying in today's environment. Further, we expect our best in class platform to help us achieve enhanced returns. Starting with the year one yield in the mid-5s that we anticipate will grow quickly thereafter. In addition, the quality and location of the homes we acquired are right in line with the type of product we'd like to own more of. In particular, these are great homes within desirable infill neighborhoods that we believe will provide strong rent growth and value appreciation. Over 90% of these homes we purchased overlap with our existing Sunbelt footprint, including within our Florida and Texas markets along with Las Vegas, Phoenix, Atlanta and the Carolinas. Outside of this transaction, we continue to work with our outstanding homebuilder partners across the country. During the second quarter, we took delivery on a 157 of these brand new homes and added an additional 173 homes to our new product pipeline. Our expected future deliveries remained at just under $900 million at the end of the second quarter. Moving forward, we remain focused on smart external growth through our multi-channel acquisition strategy. And as we previously announced, Scott Eisen joins us next week as our Chief Investment Officer, and we're excited to add his insight as we further explore disciplined growth opportunities, including additional bulk, purchasing from smaller operators and an expansion of our homebuilder pipeline At the same time, we will continue to keep our heads down and create more meaningful experiences for our residents. So just growing our ancillary services business and developing new ways for us to engage with our customers. The second topic I want to discuss is the ongoing fundamental tailwinds for our business. We expect these to continue to support our growth objectives for many years to come. Nearly one-fifth of the U.S. population or almost 60 million people are between the ages of 23 and 35 years old. We believe this to be a strong indicator of the future demand for our business as they form families and approach our average new resident age of 38.5 years old. Demand for single family homes for lease has been further enhanced by the rising cost and the burden of homeownership. According to the latest data from John Burns, leasing a home is nearly $1,000 cheaper per month on average than buying a home in one of our markets. This is a reflection of not only an increase in mortgage rates, but also the overall lack of new housing supply. In addition, for-sale inventory remains well below demand, which continued to help support home prices. This in turn aids our ability to sell non-core or underperforming assets at attractive cap rates, and use those proceeds for accretive capital recycling. Moving on now to my third topic, which is how we continue to improve the resident experience and reinforce our commitment to resident choice and flexibility. The most recent example of this is our partnership with Esusu. We're proud to help our residents build good credit by offering positive credit reporting to all our residents using Esusu's platform at no cost to our residents. This partnership helps to remove barriers to housing choice, allows our residents to improve their credit profile in order to achieve their financial goals faster. In closing, I'm excited by how we are executing and driving growth today. I would like to express my thanks to our dedicated associates for the hard work and commitment, which have been instrumental to our successes. We believe the increasing demand for single-family rentals, favorable demographic trends and the flexibility and choice that we provide our residents position us well for both sustained growth and value creation, which we will continue to relentlessly pursue. With that, I'll pass it on to Charles, our President and Chief Operating Officer.
Charles Young: Thanks, Dallas. Once again, we were able to build on positive momentum to drive another great quarter. I'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work through this point in peak season, including all of our outstanding leasing, maintenance and service teams and for providing the best resident experience within the industry. We still have work to do to close out the busy summer season and to stay diligent about controlling what we can control to finish the year strong. But I'm very proud of the results we're putting up and the great execution that teams have delivered. This includes the strong effort we've made to bring on board the nearly 1,900 homes from our recent portfolio acquisition. Through our existing scale, the dedication and professionalism of our teams and our established playbook for buying larger portfolios, we expect this to be a smooth transition. In accordance with our mission, we're making a house a home for thousands of new residents who have just joined our Invitation Homes family. We're pleased to offer them the very best genuine care and outstanding service that all of our residents have come to expect from us. Moving on to our second quarter operating results, same-store NOI grew by 3.6% year-over-year. This was driven by same-store core revenue growth of 5.9% and same-store core expense growth of 11.2% The main drivers of our second quarter same-store core revenue growth were 7.4% increase in average monthly rental rate and a 7.3% increase in other income. Notably, we continue to make great progress on working through our lease compliance backlog this year. Same-store bad debt in the second quarter was 150 basis points of gross rental revenue, making us a sequential improvement of about 50 basis points since the first quarter 2023. We believe this improvement should continue as more of our markets return to pre-COVID performance. Returning to our year-over-year results, same-store core expense growth in the second quarter was primarily the result of expected increase in property taxes, along with higher turnover and property administration cost, mostly driven by progress we're making in our lease compliance backlog. Our expense growth was partially offset during the second quarter by a favorable 6% decrease in R&M expenses on greater cost controls and lower inflation. Next, I'll cover same-store leasing trends in the second quarter. Lease rates on renewals grew 6.9% year-over-year, while new lease rates grew 7.3% year-over-year. This drove second quarter blended rent growth of 7% year-over-year. In addition, average occupancy remained strong in the second quarter at 97.6%, during which is traditionally the biggest move-out season for our business. We're pleased with the balance we struck so far this year between rate and occupancy. This includes optimizing for the healthy demand we're seeing at this point in our peak leasing and move-out season, especially considering the progress I mentioned earlier on our lease compliance backlog. While, this is creating additional pressure on turnover, along with some expected moderation in occupancy through the back end of peak season. We believe we're well positioned for the future with demand for our homes and the quality of our new applicants remaining strong. In particular, the average household income for new residents who have moved in with us over the past 12 months now exceed to $138,000 a year, resulting in an average income-to-rent ratio of 5.1x. In summary, following a great first half of 2023, we're focused on maintaining our momentum going into the second half of the year. Our teams are working hard to ensure we control costs where we can and continue to provide the best leasing lifestyle in the industry for our residents. We remain focused on delivering outstanding service and strong results. I'll now turn the call over to Jon Olsen, our Chief Financial Officer.
Jon Olsen: Thanks, Charles. Today, I'll cover the following topics. First, an update on our investment grade-rated balance sheet, along with a few additional details regarding our recent portfolio acquisition. Second, financial results for the second quarter. And lastly, updated 2023 full year guidance. I'll start with our balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had over $1.4 billion in available liquidity through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our net debt to EBITDAre ratio was 5.3x as of the end of the second quarter, down from 5.7x at the end of 2022. Just under three quarters of our total debt is unsecured and over 99% of our debt is fixed rate or swapped to fixed rate. We've often emphasized how we believe our strong balance sheet positions us well for desirable growth opportunities, should they arise. Our acquisition last week of nearly 1900 homes for approximately $650 million offers an example. With an average cost per home of $346,000, the acquisition reflects a meaningful discount to market value. This attractive entry point is underscored by the portfolio's outstanding quality and location, which are typically the two best indicators of potential future growth. In addition, the acquisition further enhances our significant scale in many of our premier Sunbelt locations, which we believe has the potential to drive even greater efficiencies and higher margins over time. We funded the acquisition primarily using cash on hand, including dry powder we accumulated through outsized dispositions in the first half of this year at an average stabilized cap rate of 3.8%. The remainder was funded by our revolver. Pro forma for the acquisition, our net debt to EBITDAre ratio at June 30 remains comfortably within our targeted 5.5x to 6x range. We expect this portfolio acquisition to have an immaterial effect on AFFO per share for the remainder of this year and to be accretive to AFFO per share in 2024 and beyond. Next, I'll touch briefly on our second quarter 2023 financial results. Second quarter core FFO increased 5.3% year-over-year to $0.44 per share, primarily due to an increase in NOI. Second quarter AFFO increased 6.8% year-over-year to $0.38 per share. The last thing I'll cover is our updated 2023 full year guidance. After maintaining strong execution through much of our peak season, and with favorable fundamentals expected to remain in place, we are increasing our full year 2023 same-store NOI growth guidance to a range of 4.5% to 5.5% or an increase of 25 basis points versus the midpoint of our prior guidance. This is driven by increased same-store core revenue growth guidance of 5.75% to 6.75%, an increased same-store core expense growth guidance of 8.5% to 9.5%, both of which are up 50 basis points at the midpoint from our prior guidance. The increase to core revenue guidance is primarily due to outperformance in rent growth and occupancy in the first half of this year, balanced against our expectation that turnover will trend higher in the second half, resulting in some moderation to occupancy. As a reminder, this is primarily the result of us continuing to make good progress in working through our lease compliance backlog, which has the near-term impact of higher expected turnover and property administrative expenses, but also the longer-term benefits of releasing the homes to stronger credit residents and improving revenue over time. We're pleased with the progress we've made so far this year and as a result, our expectations for full-year bad debt have improved by 50 basis points at the midpoint to a new full year range of between 125 and 175 basis points. Our updated guidance also narrows the range and increases the midpoints of our ranges of expected core FFO and AFFO per share. We now expect full-year 2023 core FFO in a range of $1.75 to $1.81 per share, which is an increase of $0.01 per share at the midpoint. AFFO was also increased by $0.01 per share at the midpoint to a revised range of $1.45 to $1.51 per share. Updated assumptions regarding full year acquisitions and dispositions are included in the guidance section of last night's earnings release. I'll wrap up by restating our excitement for what lies ahead in the second half of this year and beyond. We will continue to focus on our strategic priorities, deliver exceptional service to our residents and drive sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Dennerlein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Josh Dennerlein: Yes. Hi guys. Thanks for the time. Just wanted to touch base on the portfolio of acquired, I guess how long will it take to kind of integrated into your portfolio. And is there any capital recycling that you're planning off the bat?
Dallas Tanner: Hi, this is Dallas. Thanks for the question. As far as integrating the portfolio our yield to Charles here on the operational side, it's typically pretty easy. We don't have any market that has saved more than 350 units and we have pretty good history of doing that. I think on the capital recycling piece. Look, we've been active on the disposition side in trying to do accretive capital recycling. And I think the market not having enough overall supply in the resale space has allowed us to when we decided to sell homes get really good what I would call kind of end-user sales prices and to be able to recycle into a high quality portfolio in the mid-5s is something that we did pretty bullishly. I'll hand it over to Charles, you can speak. And then just on how we integrate any new product when it comes to scale into a market.
Charles Young: Dallas said it well. We've been through this before, just want have to see a little bigger and across multiple markets. But on an individual basis, we've been able to take in portfolios like this and Vegas and Phoenix and other market and it's just more of the same for us. We have a great team essentially that manages how we roll it into our systems, we get eyes on assets, we make sure that we're providing genuine care to the residents. As it - as it turns out now we just - we roll them in on kind of a media basis and we're getting out there and we're working with them where they are in their process and some of them are in lease. Some of them are moving in soon, we just pick it up from there and then we communicate with them well. So it's kind of an ongoing process, there's no real timeline because their homes are in different positions, but I am proud of how the teams are taking it on and it's - we're in the middle of it right now. Its exciting.
Operator: From Eric Wolfe from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Eric Wolfe: Thanks. Just to follow up on Josh's question there. If I look at as Streets website it looks like the occupancy of their SFR portfolios are in sort of the 92% to 93% range on average. I'm just curious, what sort of occupancy is the portfolio you bought, if there's an opportunity to get that higher expand margins. Where the yield on acquisition go and then - I know that's a long question but is this sort of representative of the type of opportunities that you're looking at across other portfolios?
Dallas Tanner: I'll start with what you mentioned last. We met - we talked about this at NAREIT. We've talked about this in some of the NDRs we've done through the spring and kind of early summer. And look, there's sort of this moment in the marketplace right now where smaller kind of mid-scale operators I think are sort of having the high class debate with themselves about what do they do going forward. There's not a lot of visibility, obviously for some folks in terms of what the capital markets are going to allow for. And I think as you look at our business and scale and platform, and the operating efficiencies that we run with, we have a pretty good history of creating a really efficient margin profile in the markets where we have scale. And so I think that there is going to be some compelling opportunities for companies like ours, as we've sort of exhibited in this trade that we did this month to create additional margin expansion. With this particular portfolio, look, we think there is upside in terms of how we can operate it, that we can add to, call it, the existing margin profile in our markets. And there is reasons for doing these, right? One example is Texas is a market that we want to grow in, we've got - call it plus or minus close to 500 homes that are going to go into our Dallas and Houston portfolios here. While we think we can operate these with greater, call it efficiencies and some embedded growth there, it actually helps our existing portfolios. Because as we scale up relative to the things that we own, we should see additional opportunities for margin enhancement. So, look, it's not one-size-fits-all out there in terms of where and what portfolio opportunities may be available from professional management companies, but we certainly want to be ready. And I think in this situation, we are ready, we really like the real estate, real estate that we are familiar with over time and it's going to make a lot of sense for our business over the long haul.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jamie Feldman: Thank you. In last quarter's call, you talked a lot about the lease compliance backlog. Can you just give us an update in terms of how large it is, what the major markets are, where it's still having an impact in. I guess even more importantly, what's the upside to kind of normalized occupancy and a regular turnover rate as you work through and kind of complete that backlog?
Charles Young: Hi, this is Charles. Thanks for the question. Yes, as we said, we thought that we were going to see a little heavier work in the first part of the year in regards to the lease compliance backlog. I think, as we look back at Q1, it was a little quieter and things started to pick up in Q2. We've made good progress and you can see it in our numbers going down 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter. The major markets are where we wanted to see the movement. And so we see this as a positive sign that's SoCal, Atlanta, Vegas has made some nice progress and so as NorCal. And the flip side of that is that we're getting a little bit of a spike in turnover, and that's expected, we do - it's hard to know when it was going to come through, but the good news is the backlog is breaking with the courts and all that. And so that allows us to kind of move these homes through and you'll see some pressure as I mentioned in my comments on occupancy, towards the back half of peak season. But the good news is, demand is still really strong. And so we are able to release quickly, teams are executing well. So we're turning homes quickly, [Phase 3] residents are in a healthy place. So all that is good. This is - signs are positive, we still have things to work through, we're not there all the way yet, but we like where we're going. And ultimately, we ended Q2 here at mid 97s. I expect that will come down to the low 97s in Q3, we'll see where we end up. But with this demand I think we're going to roll back up and we're going to be in the mid 97s overall for the year, we started the year strong, we'll work-through this backlog. The one thing I will mention is, I think we worked through most of the markets this year. That's the goal and hope. But there could be some bleed into next year markets like Southern California, and we'll see how we do in the others. Atlanta has a lot of work to do. Those are our two biggest markets, if you - to your question, the biggest markets that have the largest impact on our portfolio due to size and due to the backlog are Atlanta and Southern California.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Steve Sakwa: Yes, great. Thanks. Charles, I was just wondering if you could talk about kind of where the leasing spreads are in the third quarter, where did renewals go out, say, for July and August and I guess, what are your expectations for third quarter and for the back half of the year.
Charles Young: Yes, thanks for the question. In terms of - we know we're out on our most recent renewal requests go out to September and October, and we're actually in the low 80s to mid-80s, so we see a really as being healthy. We're not done with July yet. So, can get final numbers, but we're seeing more of the same healthy performance where new leases are in the low sevens, renewals in the high 8s, high 6s, if you will. We'll see where the blend settles out. But this is typical of what we expected for the summer. New lease above renewals. And we'll see how it moderates and when it does but right now, we're still seeing good demand and we like that given my quest - the answer to the question earlier, we're getting a little bit more turnover and we get a chance to release these homes and what I failed to mention before is we're putting really good healthy residents in there with an average household income of 138,000. So we're in a good shape, we've tightened up our screening criteria, we're still seeing good demand across the board. So we expect that we'll see more of the same in Q3, but we'll see how it moderates as we get towards the back half of peak season here.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski from Green Street. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Hi. Thanks for the time. I just have a follow up question on the portfolio acquisition. Dallas, you just - I like to hear how you weighed purchasing this portfolio versus deploying capital you’re your own stock which at least earlier this year was felt like it was an even larger discount to private market values?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, hi, John, thanks for the question. It's certainly something we think about and what would move the needle over time and distance. And while we have events and things that happened inside of the quarter, we really do try to have a long view in terms of how we want to create meaningful external growth and also what I would say is better-quality cash flows for the company over time, which we would view as, call it, have far more of an impact in the things we want to do strategically with the business and maybe some near-term stock buybacks, which we've never done as an organization, we've certainly talked about it. With this particular portfolio look we think what's inside of a year-ish kind of time period, we're going to be in the 6's in terms of call it yield on cost that doesn't take into consideration things like ancillary and some of the other things that we can do and then it also is part of our consistent process around capital recycling and you look at these things that we're selling kind of call it a four-ish cap rate on average, you'd be able to recycle them to something that's pretty high-quality getting us to a six pretty quick. It's an area where we want to continue to probably lean in if anything, try to find ways to create better, kind of long-term growth for our current shareholders. So we'll consider everything, but we're managing with a long view here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks. On the portfolio acquisition what rent growth did you underwrite in year one to achieve that mid-5% cap rate that you quoted and I know you have the revolver availability to fund a portion of that deal, but what are sort of the plans to permanently finance the transaction?
Jon Olsen: Hi, Austin it's Jon. It's good question . So, we funded this acquisition primarily with cash on hand. So it's about $495 million of cash and a $150 million draw on our revolver. Of that $495 million of cash, $30 million of that was funded in upfront deposits prior to the end of the second quarter. So, I think from our perspective, the actual revolver draw is fairly small. I think as we consider permanent capital, what I'll tell you is sort of what we always say because it's how we always approach things. One, we're very fortunate that we don't have any near-term maturities. So there's no sort of ticking clock that would force us to do something at a disadvantageous time. But secondly, we are constantly monitoring the market and we're always working in the background to be prepared, so that we can take advantage of opportunities if circumstances and market conditions warrant it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Brad Heffern: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Can you talk about property taxes and how the information you have now compares with the original guide? And if you could comment on the impact of the Texas legislation as well that would be great.
Jon Olsen: Sure, so in the second quarter, property tax was up a little over 11% year-over-year. This was expected and we talked about this on the last call, primarily because we recorded a large catch-up entry in the fourth quarter of last year due to the fact that we've been under-accrued in the first three quarters. So as a result, we'll see elevated year-over-year property tax increases again in the third quarter and then we'll see some moderation in the fourth quarter. I would remind you that our three largest contributors to our total tax bill are California, Georgia and Florida, which represent about 70% of the total. While California is largely known. For Florida and Georgia, we won't know how millage rates change until we start receiving those tax bills in the fourth quarter. So I would say, big picture at this point, we haven't yet seen anything that would cause us to revise our full-year property tax guidance up or down. With respect to Texas, a couple of things there. Thus far, the legislation calls for a $0.107 decrease in tax bill per $100 of assessed value and then there is some additional compression available that's going to fluctuate by jurisdiction, based on how the redistribution under the Robin Hood laws worked for a school tax funding, but I would also point out that Texas isn't a big state for us and so I would expect that while this is certainly beneficial, I don't think in the grand scheme it's going to move the needle too much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Tricarico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Daniel Tricarico: Thanks. Jon or Charles, can you break down the components of the 50 basis-point increase in same-store revenue, rents, occupancy and bad debt. And maybe how that bad debt in 2Q compares to expectations for the rest of the year.
Charles Young: Sure. So, I think it's - we've seen maybe some marginal improvement from our mid-single-digit rate growth assumption that we talked about on the last call, as well as sort of a faster pace of improvement with respect to our bad debt experience which is absolutely something that we're very encouraged to see. As we look at the back part of the year though, we do have to balance those positive trends against the fact that we're anticipating continued higher turnover here for the next few months and that is going to have an impact on occupancy over time and as Charles has talked about in the past, we're also very cognizant of the fact that there is a balance to be struck between rate and occupancy. And so we want to make sure that we're being mindful of all of those facts when we think about guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Haendel St. Juste: Hi, good morning out there. Just a couple more on the portfolio. So what does that mid-5s cap rate translate into on an IRR basis. And then curious, just more broadly what you're seeing out there, portfolio-wise, pricing is getting more in line with the mid-5% that you targeted in your capacity or perhaps interest in doing more portfolio deals? Thanks.
Jon Olsen: Hi, Haendel. On the last question, I would say, look, I think there's going to be opportunities to talk to other operators in this space over the next year and I think a lot of those conversations will be dependent on what kind of the capital markets is allowing for. In terms of how we view, obviously, the return profile of any trade that we make, it's two-part, right? It's one part, call it going in yield on cost. The second piece on a risk-adjusted basis would take into considerations our expectations around HPA and things like that. This was obviously so far an unlevered transaction if you look at it in a binary way. We would expect healthy home price appreciation, so I call it on an unlevered basis, we'd probably see this in like the high-single digits, but it just depends and it's a mixture of markets and things like that, so yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keegan Carl from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Keegan Carl: Yes, thanks for the time guys . So both in the press release, the commentary you called out increased turnover expense, a pretty big driver of your same-store OpEx going higher on a year-over-year basis. I'm just curious, one, how this is trending versus your initial expectations and then what your outlook is for the rest of the year on turnover and then do you think we're '23 end to be a good run-rate going forward on turnover?
Charles Young: This is Charles. I'll start and see if Jon wants to add anything. Look, we knew we're going to have a little higher turnover this year given the lease compliance backlog. We're still running historically really low on turnover, which is great. It was really difficult to as we kind of look forward through the year to predict when it was going to happen. It was a little slower than expected in Q1 and really picked up here in the second half of Q2. And we think that will maintain into Q3. The thought here is that it will start to moderate towards the back end of the year. Hard to say exactly if that's going to be our run rate, just given what I talked about earlier around some of the markets and how quickly we're going to get to the end of this in like, say, Southern California or Atlanta where we have the biggest impact. The thing to think about with that turnover is it has two impacts. Some of this on the lease compliance, these turns take a little longer, costs a little bit more and that's some of the impact you're seeing in our expenses. But we're - the good news is we're able to work through this and we see this as transitory. And it's not going to - we'll work through it as much as we can, as fast as we can this year. And that's what's in our numbers and I think that gives us some optimism as we think and look forward to next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dennis McGill: Hi, thank you. I guess my question, Dallas, would be on, just thinking about home price appreciation and where we're sitting here a year ago, I think everyone would have expected there to be more pressure on the market than maybe there's been and that's obviously impacting the ability to buy on the MLS. Just wanted to hear how you're thinking about that. And to the degree there remains a disconnect between what you can sell at and where these portfolios are trading, is there a reason why the portfolio dollars wouldn't just go to the MLS and sell at a much more attractive yield and does that impact the ability to do some of these in the future?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, good question, Dennis. Look, on the last part of your question, I think it's fair to assume that the frictional costs when you're doing anything in scale is really hard. And I think we're as good as anyone in this - in terms of selling one-off in the end-user market. Even when we sell those kind of high 3s, low 4s, we have some frictional costs that are associated with those sales. If you're not doing it all the time, I think it can be a little bit more difficult to just say, hey, could I sell 1,000 homes tomorrow and what would - how would I think about that cost structure. Look, I think the home prices have largely been buoyed up because of the lock-in effect that there is a lot of really attractive mortgages in place that I think both homes - current homeowners or people that are owning real estate in the single family space, it's actually an asset, it's a liability on the balance sheet of the home. But the reality is, it's an asset, and there's a lot of - and we've talked about in some of our other calls, mortgage rates, call it inside of 80% of U.S. mortgages are inside of 5% which is really I think what's keeping the market supported. And that lack of volume is creating really still a feeding frenzy sort of mentality when somebody is selling a home. And we view that as an asset for our business when we want to call. And so homes - and we've talked about that, that you might see us be a little bit more aggressive selling some homes this year. But by and large, the market feels really healthy. I agree with you, we have not seen the degradation in home prices within our portfolio, but I think when we have these opportunities where we can take advantage of that sort of bid-ask spread being a buyer. We have a long view on owning great single-family residential and we want to own it with scale in the markets we operate in. So when those opportunities show themselves like this one, expect us try to figure out how to do that transaction, if it makes sense.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Derrick Metzler: Hi, this is Derrick Metzler on for Adam Kramer. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about market rent trends across your portfolio and do an update on loss to lease today. Thanks.
Charles Young: Yes, this is Charles. We're seeing what's historically been really strong new lease and renewal rates through the summer, take out the COVID kind of anomaly. When we're in that blend of a 7 in Q2 that's really strong. That's maintaining here as we get into Q3, new lease side, the markets that are leading have been kind of markets that have been out in front for the last year or so. It's our Florida markets with Orlando Q2 north of 9% and we have five, six markets in a mid to high 8s Tampa, South Florida, Southern California, Atlanta, Carolina. Good news is as we talked about earlier, as we're cleaning up the backlog that we were able to release new homes because of the demand, and that's been great. Renewals are holding steady. We're kind of stabilizing here and they're kind of high 6s and we think that'll be steady through the year. If not, we'll see where we end, you saw, I mentioned earlier that we went out in September and October in the low 8s. So I think that's real positive as we think through on that side. And some of this will be a balance between occupancy and rate as John talked about when we're talking - working through this backlog, but that turnover impact isn't in all markets, it's in certain markets where we have a backlog, highlighted by Atlanta, Vegas and SoCal. All the markets in Q2 actually turnover went down year-over-year. So it really is market specific. And we're seeing kind of good demand across the board, the only softness that we're seeing is a little bit in Vegas. Some of it is because of the lease compliance backlog, some of it is, there is some competition in the market and a little bit of slowdown in that market in general. So we're paying attention to it. So overall, we're seeing really good healthy positive trends. And we're excited about trying to finish off peak season strong and finish off the year really strong.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Powell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Anthony Powell: Hi, good morning. Question on the builder pipeline, we've seen homebuilders have good success in selling new homes to - and new homeowners. Are they showing less interest in selling homes to you and others? And as a SFR space, do they continue to see you guys get partners good outlets for certain other homes?
Charles Young: Well, I think we mentioned on the script that we're continually adding to our pipeline. I'd say, sort of the opposite, I think most companies would envy the position the public builders are in, they're lowly levered, they are taking a much larger share of overall home sales as it relates to call it U.S. housing stock. And it's because they're one of the few groups out there that can go out and build and create. Now that being said I think the playbook that we've built with Pulte is sort of our beginning sponsored partner is now actually starting to work its way through with several different relationships for us. I actually think it's sort of caught on that this is a really nice way for an operator of for-sale homebuilding business to be able to align some interest with professional management companies that want to be a natural buyer of some of this product over long periods of time. And so I actually expect that side of our business to grow, think our teams, largely led by Peter DiLello and now Scott Eisen coming in, have done a really nice job of starting to build up a frequency there. And I think the nice part about it is we were able to get under the hood early and really talk about our strategy as a company with these partners and helping them understand where we want to grow our footprint. And then I think over time, it also allows us to get under the hood and have an influence on things like portfolio composition and design and neighborhood fit and feel, which is an important part of our overall value factor for the customer is, they're thinking about choice. And I think what and it's still too early for us to really have a strong view on this, but I think the customer coming in to brand new product really does view that that move-in experiences their home. And my instincts, I can't prove this yet with any data, but I think they'll prove an even stickier customer over time as we bring out some of these newer product that has a little bit more of a focus. And lastly, the thing we love about it, which I can't emphasize enough is we are very G&A light in this program. So we don't have a lot of our balance sheet tied up in dirt or other kind of potential riskier parts of that business. We'd rather just continue to partner with proven operators in this space and be a good playing partner for them. That strategy is really working for us at this point in time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. A couple of questions. I'm assuming we're towards the end. I guess, I apologize if I missed it on the same-store expense guide, the increase what drove that? I mean it seems like the bad debt is lower, the churn has picked up but albeit temporarily and set to decrease in to year end and taxes. It's too early to tell and no change in expectations. Just curious on what drove the expense increase in guide. And then the second part is just on the renewals, why is that decelerated or the pace of increase has slowed and as the September, October numbers that you put out there, in the 8s, does that imply a reacceleration, or is there some get-back that would kind of keep that number steady for September and October expected.
Jon Olsen: Hi, Juan. It's Jon. I'll take the first part of your question and hand it off to Charles for the second part. I think it's a couple of things. On the expense side, what we're seeing as Charles noted is that the turnover has come, there was a little bit of a delay in terms of when it really started to show up in the portfolio. I would also say that turnover increased each month since the end of the first quarter. So it is more concentrated. And as we started to see kind of the flow through impacts on a whole variety of different line items in the P&L. What we're seeing sort of suggested that moving the goalposts on the expense guide did make sense. Now to be clear, I want to remind everyone that we think working through this backlog is just fundamentally healthy for our business long-term, right? It's something that is going to allow us to put stronger credit tenants back into those homes, get them back in service, get them back cash flowing, but there is short-term pressure on expenses. And I think it's important that we acknowledge that. And that's what we've done here.
Charles Young: This is Charles. I'll just add on the renewal side. As you think through kind of portfolio mix and kind of the cohorts that come through for renewal in the summer or in the peak season if you will or off-season in Q1 or Q4, we've historically really been strong at pushing out trying to capture as much of that market that's out there and you think about the last couple of years on the new lease side, we've been in that high mid-teens, also on the renewal side. So when the summer renewals come through, they're coming off a pretty high base. So we're just realistic on kind of what we can do. And if you get into the back half while we still have good demand, there is an opportunity to capture where market is, and we didn't go out as high in those shoulder seasons, if you will. So that's some of what you're seeing, I think we can see how it all plays out and what it implies, but implies that generally we're still seeing good strong demand and we're going to do what we can to kind of capture where market is for these homes and that portfolio when it comes through of homes at that time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tyler Batory from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Tyler Batory: Good morning. Thank you. Few follow-ups on the acquisition conversation here. What do cap rates look like on the MLS channel? Where are you bidding? Where are deals clearly in the market? And Dallas, just given some of the commentary on portfolio deals, some of the scale, you can build pretty quickly on those, plus some of the attractive pricing with your builder relationships, does it make more sense to hold off on the MLS as an acquisition channel, perhaps conserve some of your capital for some of these other opportunities and traditionally channel-agnostic, location-specific has been a big part of the strategy, but wondering if maybe that might change, just given some of the opportunities that are out there?
Dallas Tanner: It's a great question, so I think you're basically just looking for color in that question of what we're seeing real-time MLS and how we view that relative to some of these things. So look, painting a broad stroke on kind of the market, we've hit this in a couple different ways. In our markets, in the 16 markets that we operate, if we were active in the MLS today and really buying some scale, it would be in the low-5s, if not close to probably, maybe a couple of markets might touch mid-5 once in a while, but not really. So for us, we haven't been very active, to be clear. Really the last four quarters, we've not bought very much if any MLS property in the resale space, we've been really just taking deliveries through our new product pipeline and our merchant build program and then spending time talking to other operators around some of these kind of bigger opportunities where we can integrate scale much quicker. I do think that there is a bid-ask spread between where portfolios need to trade today and where the scale one-off sense would occur, and I think that's kind of below-5s as I mentioned before, if not inside of a 5 in some of these. And Las Vegas, for example, you can't buy a home at a 5-cap, it's just next to impossible. It's all sub-5. So, look, I don't view the MLS as a channel for us, it will be one thing we always looking at. We write hundreds of offers every week at price points that we'd be willing to transact at and we're striking out quite a bit because that spread so wide. I love the entry point that we're seeing in kind of the new builder stuff. Most of our pipeline that we're reviewing and putting in play right now is a little bit closer to a 6-cap, albeit the deliveries are expected, call it a year to 18 months out on any new product that we're putting in contract. So, yes it just feels like there's some dislocation. This should be what is beneficial to be a REIT. We're lowly levered. We have access to capital, we still feel really good about our access to capital, from a liquidity perspective. And we've got a platform that can handle chunks of growth like this and digested very easily and build it right into our normal operating procedure where we can bring in the ancillary services and everything else. So, it's a good moment, a good chapter for us to see this kind of growth in today's market, but - and I expect that we'll keep our nose down and keep trying to find other ways to create additional scale in the markets we operate.
Operator: Our next question is from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Linda Tsai: Hi, thanks for taking my question. For your new portfolio, what's the average rent you charge for these homes and how does that compare to the current rent of your existing portfolio? And then just in terms of margin enhancement from integrating, can you give us a little more color on what initiatives you're thinking about?
Charles Young: So on your first question, basically in-place rents, as we took these homes all around $2,200, which for the markets that these are comprised of is about 10% greater than where our current average rents in these markets are. So all accretive in terms of that, but we do see the same embedded loss to lease in this opportunity as we do in our own portfolio, somewhere between call it 8% and 10% upside in our books, so and I'm sorry, I didn't get the last question, the last question, third part of your question.
Linda Tsai: In terms of margin enhancement from integrating into your existing portfolio, just a little more color on what initiatives you're thinking about?
Charles Young: It's too early to tell, but like our Texas markets, we would basically grow the portfolio by 10%, and we would need to bring on really any headcount there. So we will see additional expansion kind of in those two markets, but in terms of like ancillary, that'll be a slow process because what we typically do is bring some of those services into play as leases revolve and renew. And so, as Charles mentioned earlier on the call, as we get into the book and as we're actually operating it and updating leases and lease agreements and updating our renewal pricing, that's when those ancillary services will be able to come in. And so that will integrate in over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski from Green Street. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Thanks for taking the follow-up. Charles, I was hoping you could expand on the weakness in pricing power and the new lease growth rates in Vegas you alluded to. What do you think is driving that specifically? And then maybe on a somewhat related topic, are you seeing notable increase in shadow supply from conversions of short-term rentals, Airbnbs to traditional rentals in Las Vegas or other vacation-heavy destinations?
Charles Young: Yes, I'll take your last question - your last question first. Not really much impact on the shadow piece, it's out there. Frankly, it's always been there. I think it's a fair question, given the low-interest rates and how homeowners may be approaching whether they want to sell or lease a home, but we've always been competing against the market and that's mostly driven by mom-and-pops. Again, we're just kind of operating within the dynamic. Going back to Vegas, each market has its own dynamics. There is a couple of things going on. One, we've had a real spike in turnover as I talked about trying to get through the lease compliance. The good news is the courts have really come, started to open up and move faster. And so we're competing against some of our own supply, to be honest with you. So that's put some pressure, but we're not the only ones operating in that market. So there's other supply that are going through the same backlog and so that puts some extra supply in the market temporarily. We saw some of this in Phoenix last year and worked through it pretty quickly in a month or two. What we will see over time is trying to figure out what, if there is any kind of demographic change with Vegas in terms of people moving out of the market. It's hard for us to get a good vision of that right now. But right now it's more around the supply that exists in our own book and with others. But we don't see it as right now a long-term trend. We'll work through this and we'll see how it plays out over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jason Sabshon: Hi, this is Jason Sabshon on for Jade. Can you please comment on the outlook for property insurance and do you see a captive insurer as a potential solution for some of the rate increases that we've been seeing?
Charles Young: Hi, thanks for the question. I will say that similar to what we talked about on our last call, while we don't love the extent to which our property tax - sorry, our insurance bill went up year-over-year. I think we were very fortunate, relative to what we've heard from some of the other REITs and I think that's down to a couple of things. One, we have a very favorable loss history. Our insurers have never lost money on Invitation Homes, the worst year they ever had with last year when they broke even. Secondly, I would say that the geographic dispersion and the granularity of the assets compared to traditional commercial real estate which are big and chunky, certainly is a benefit in terms of risk mitigation. And lastly, I would say we're not coastal. So, I think if you put all that together, we feel really good about where we landed. I think for the third and fourth quarter, as we talked about on the last call, you should expect to see quarterly year-over-year increases in the neighborhood of 20% with the full-year insurance expense line item being up a little over 16%. As far as captives and other things of that nature, look we are going into next year's renewal, we're going to be evaluating a whole host of different alternatives, because I think this is not a - a one-and-done type of situation. We've seen a lot of capacity leave the market. And I think we've seen a lot of carriers who are trying to recoup fairly painful loss histories over the last several years, so I think it's something to stay tuned to, but I can't give you any particular insight into what our strategy is going to be for next year just yet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Tricarico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Daniel Tricarico: Thank you. Sorry, going back to Austin's question earlier and Jon, what do you think you could raise unsecured debt today? And you know, credit spreads have come in recently and you talked about your leverage being lower than your longer term targets. So, do you view this as a good time to raise that kind of capital or are dispositions going to stay the preference?
Jon Olsen: Well, a couple of observations. Thanks for the question. Dispositions have been our most attractive cost of capital thus far this year. We have sold homes year-to-date an average stabilized cap rate of under 4% and then we've been able to put that cash in the bank and earn 5% plus. And then in the case of this portfolio trade, redeploy that capital into something with an even higher yield. So we think that the prospects for accretive capital recycling driven by strategic dispositions that - that has worked out pretty well for us. With respect to the unsecured markets, yes, it certainly does seem as though credit spreads have ground a little bit tighter with the GDP report this morning. I think the tenors is probably gapping out as we speak a little bit. But we're going to continue to monitor the market We are constantly sort of keeping track of where we think a new deal might go off at a variety of different tenors. It's just part of how we run the business regular way is we want to keep a very close eye on what the opportunity set looks like. So, we're always doing the work in the background to be in a position to move quickly if we think it makes sense to do so and I don't think our approach is going to change.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jamie Feldman: Great, thanks. Just two quick follow-ups. One, Dallas, you had mentioned, it's a great time to be a REIT - part of being a REIT issue equity. I just wanted to get your thoughts on equity as a source of capital today. And then secondly as you're - it seems like the winds are kind of shifting and where the opportunities are. What are your latest thoughts on expanding outside the U.S., whether Canada or anywhere else in the world. Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Hi. Great question. I think in terms of expansion, and we were pretty consistent was saying this like we run 12,000 units or 13,000 units in Atlanta as easy as we run 3800 in Seattle. And so I think we'd love to see all of our markets get closer to 8000 units and 10,000 units. We see margin expansion, we see ability to offer different services, we can be pro care systems can all run a heck of a lot more efficient and we get better granularity and efficiency with scale in those markets. So I would expect - our first choice would be subject to an opportunity set, I guess, would be to just continue to build scale and density in the markets we operate. We've also been on the record that we would like to own and some other markets over time. And we see that there is a little bit of Nashville in this trade. And there are markets like Austin and San Antonio and Salt Lake City that we all find very appealing for variety of reasons. I think internationally it's a fun question to speculate on. But the reality is, most of these countries probably have more restrictive housing policies. And unless there were a real strategic opportunity or a reason to get it, I don't know why we would just stay in, this great country that we have an amazing space for housing and we can build it, we can buy it, we can improve it. It's just - it's a very good place to operate and be a REIT. In terms of equity, and Jon just answered this is how we think about the capital markets. Look, we think about our cost to capital daily in this business. And we try to hold ourselves accountable to being smart stewards of capital. I think we've gotten fairly good marks over time of being smart capital allocators. I like that we're disposing of homes that are non-core or in parts of the country, there may be a little harder operate and kind of a four or sub-four cap reinvesting that capital in the mid-5s pushing to a 6 on the new construction. That's a winning strategy right now, all the world sort of funky. It's been nice to see that our - call it our share price has gotten a little bit better, but it's not in the zip code that we're really thrilled about. And for kind of a variety of reasons, when we look at where kind of home prices are actually trading. And so, I think, to Jon's point you will probably watch the capital markets over time, see how those evolve, we'd certainly love to see good performance buoy up our stock price even further, but we're comfortable recycling capital and being smart and as I've said before, we're not going to be afraid to do this stuff off balance sheet with partners that want access to SFR. And so we have current availability in our second Rockpoint venture of about $700 million. I'd expect we'll start to deploy some of that over the coming year. We have an untapped revolver and we're going to still continue to generate good free cash flow in this business. So between dispositions and all that, I just remind I think we've got ample dry powder to go look at some of these opportunities to continue to try to grow the business.
Operator: This completes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: We appreciate everyone's support, everyone being on the call. We hope everyone has a safe rest of summer and look forward to seeing some of you in the fall.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-02 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings. And welcome to the Invitation Homes First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Scott McLaughlin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Scott McLaughlin: Good morning and welcome. I am here today from Invitation Homes with Dallas Tanner, Chief Executive Officer; Charles Young, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; and Jon Olsen, EVP of Corporate Strategy and Finance and as previously announced, the company’s CFO beginning June 1st. Following our prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with our covering sell-side analysts. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and then re-queue if you would like to ask a follow-up question. During today’s call, we may reference our first quarter 2023 earnings release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures in yesterday’s earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Dallas, our Chief Executive Officer.
Dallas Tanner: Good morning and thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report a strong first quarter result yesterday afternoon, reflecting a great start for a year. Average same-store occupancy improved 50 basis points over the fourth quarter to 97.8% and new lease rent growth has accelerated sequentially every month so far this year. We have encouraged by the execution of our teams and remain bullish on our industry and our business. As long-term fundamentals continue to be favorable, bolstered by our superior balance sheet and liquidity and backed by our best-in-class platform, we will seek to continue to deliver sector-leading NOI growth as we have done for the past five years. Since our inception, we have matured and performed through a variety of operating and macroeconomic environments, including a global pandemic and record high inflation. Throughout this time, we have witnessed the resilience and the relative strength of our business. This is illustrated by a great chart from John Burns Research and Consulting that we included in our March Investor deck. This data shows that over the past 40 years, national SFR rent growth has historically stayed positive even during recessions. In addition, in a recessionary period, we would expect that our business could see a reduction in move-outs and a benefit to occupancy and that external growth opportunities can become more attractive. For these reasons and more, we believe single-family leasing is one of the most stable property types in real estate. The Invitation Homes offers one of the best risk-adjusted return propositions compared to other commercial real estate sectors. To start, supply and demand fundamentals continue to favor our business. On the demand side, this includes the demographic surge of the millennial generation who have begun reaching our average resident age of 39 years old. But it also includes individuals and families of all agents who desire the flexibility and convenience of leasing a single-family home. Like all of us on the call today, our residents value great schools, proximity to growing job centers, access to transportation corridors in desirable neighborhoods for their families. They usually need or want more space with a garage and a yard to better fit their growing household and to have more room for a home office, a kids play room and their pets. And more importantly, today’s residents are requesting flexibility and choice along with the appeal of a down payment light lifestyle. Further driving the demand for single-family home leasing is the rising cost of homeownership, as well as the lack of inventory of for-sale housing. According to John Burns March data, and weighted by our markets, the monthly cost of owning a single-family home remain on average over $900 more expensive than leasing that same home. Others have calculated an even higher cost of average for ownership versus leasing. On the supply side, the U.S. continues to suffer from a shortage of housing. With the shortfall in supply relative to demand estimated to be in the millions of units. Like most economists, we think the best way to improve housing affordability is to grow the U.S. housing stock, and more specifically, by encouraging development of new housing supply. This important work really needs to begin at the state and local levels, including planning and zoning boards, and we stand at a strong support of those who want to bring positive change in this regard. In fact, we see ourselves as part of the solution to increasing housing supply through our new product pipeline that is now approaching $1 billion. We will continue to seek out responsible opportunities to add supply and as a result, help improve housing availability and affordability. In consideration of these fundamentals, we believe leasing a home is a great option for anyone who wants all the benefits of living in a home without the hassle or expensive homeownership. And we believe Invitation Homes offers the best service platform and locations for residents to choose from. One reason for this relates to core belief we have held since the early days of our business that we could revolutionalize the single-family resident experience by professionalizing resident service. In short, we took a decades old antiquated mom-and-pop model and transformed that based on the needs and desires of a 21st century resident. As part of that approach, we continue to expand our service offerings and look for new and better ways to enhance the simplicity and convenience of the leasing lifestyle. At the same time, we continue to explore ways to improve efficiency through size and scale. We also remain focused on growing our portfolio accretively over the long-term, and more importantly, in locations where we would expect the most favorable long-term fundamentals. With regards to growth, we have committed to being prudent capital allocators through all real estate cycles. For the first quarter of 2023, this meant being a net seller of homes disposing of 284 wholly-owned homes for gross proceeds of $95 million and buying 181 wholly-owned homes for $62 million. For the most part, we have recycled capital out of less desirable homes and into brand new well-located homes as part of our new product pipeline. We believe our strategy of partnering with the best homebuilders is a superior approach to investing on a risk-adjusted basis as it keeps development and its associated risk, including an expensive land bank and high G&A load off of our balance sheet. At the same time, our strong balance sheet and current liquidity, including JV capital allows us to remain nimble and as opportunities arise, we will be ready. Before I close, I want to speak to the continued dislocation between the retail pricing of single-family homes and public market valuations. Strong demand for housing continues to support home prices in our markets and at our price points. While the lock-in effect, which existing homeowners are discouraged from giving up their lower mortgage rates is keeping resale supply relatively low. We have seeing evidence of this supply and demand imbalance when we list our homes for sale and received multiple competing offers at great prices. We believe the resilience of the U.S. housing market in the current cycle has been underestimated over the past year and that the protracted supply and demand imbalance for single-family housing continues to provide good structural support for home prices just as it does for rent growth. Lastly, on the topic of sustainability. I hope you have taken a moment to read our new progress overview, which we published last month. It’s available on our sustainability webpage and includes information about our efforts to increase the quantity and the quality of our ESG disclosures. This includes new greenhouse gas emission disclosures and an opportunity for engage stakeholders to participate in an online survey to share their thoughts and their ideas with us. We welcome this feedback. My thanks again to all of our teams for their hard work, dedication and commitment this past quarter and for the remainder of the year ahead. Our associates are the heart and soul of Invitation Homes and we appreciate how they embrace the responsibility to deliver the highest level of service to our residents and strong results for our shareholders. Our plan is to keep pushing to be great here. With that, I will pass it on to Charles, our President and Chief Operating Officer.
Charles Young: Thanks, Dallas, and good morning, everyone. I’d like to begin by thanking our associates for starting off the year strong. I am really proud of the efforts you display every single day to ensure that our residents feel heard, served and appreciated. I will now review the details of our first quarter operating results. I will start with same-store core revenues, which grew 7.7% year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by an 8.5% increase in average monthly rent and a 7.3% increase in other income. These results include some encouraging signs, over half of our markets are now operating in a more normal course of business in terms of timely rent payments and resolution processes. For our other markets, progress continues to move in the right direction as we work through these lease compliance backlogs. These improvements were reflected in our first quarter bad debt, which beat our expectations by holding flat with our fourth quarter reported results even as rent assistance declined by over half during the same period. This indicates to us that residents are returning to a more normal payment pattern post-COVID. We have also seeing stronger demand return following the winter leasing season, with new lease rent growth accelerating sequentially each month during the first quarter. Overall, for the first quarter, same-store new lease rent growth came in at 5.7% and same-store renewal growth was 8%, resulting in blended rent growth of 7.3%. Our preliminary April results show further acceleration in the new lease side to 7.5% with renewals at 7.2% and blended 7.3%. Preliminary average occupancy in April was 97.8%. Turning back to our first quarter same-store results. Core operating expenses increased 14% year-over-year, representing a favorable result compared to our initial guidance expectations for the first quarter expense growth in the mid-teens. The year-over-year increase was driven by an expected year-over-year increase in property taxes due to robust home price appreciation. In addition to the under accrual of property taxes expenses in the first three quarters of 2022, as we have previously discussed. Expense growth was also impacted by progress we have made in working through more of the lease compliance backlog compared with last year, as well as higher vacant utility costs and rates and continued inflationary pressures. Taken together, these results led to first quarter growth in same-store NOI of 5% year-over-year. Our teams continue to pursue various ways to improve our efficiency and resident experience, with technology upgrades frequently topping the list. For example, we continue to put mobile technology into the hands of our residents. This includes a mobile experience for maintenance, which we have spoken about previously. This has been a great success with residents using it to send us over 40% of maintenance requests. In addition, we have also just launched a new mobile experience for leasing. That enables prospective residents to create a profile, save searches and view their favorite houses. In today’s mobile first world, these new mobile experiences are game changers for our residents and us. Many thanks to all of our teams for working diligently to manage all the details of our business this past quarter, while staying focused on resident service and operational excellence. I believe we are well equipped and energized to carry the positive momentum you have begun through our peak leasing season and the remainder of the year. I will now turn the call over to Jon Olsen, the company’s next Chief Financial Officer.
Jon Olsen: Thank you, Charles. I am excited to join you all today. I have been part of the Invitation Homes team since 2012 and I am honored to have been named CFO upon Ernie’s departure next month. Ernie has led our finance organization for the past 7.5 years, and in that time, he has overseen tremendous growth and many important milestones for the company. We have both here in the room this morning to answer any questions you may have following our prepared remarks. I will begin by covering our financial results for the first quarter and then provide an update on our investment-grade rated balance sheet and liquidity position, before wrapping up to open the line for questions. As we have stated, our first quarter results were in line with or slightly ahead of our expectations and offer a solid start to the year. Core FFO for the first quarter of 2023 increased 9.5% year-over-year to 0.44 per share, primarily due to an increase in NOI and AFFO increased 9% to 0.38 per share. Our full year 2023 guidance remains unchanged from the initial guidance we provided in February as we are still early in the year. Next, I will cover our balance sheet and liquidity position. We believe this is an area of strength for us, not only in comparison to how far we have come since our public listing over six years ago, but also relative to many of our investment-grade peers today. In the six years since our IPO and merger, we have applied a consistent and measured strategy to delever the balance sheet, improve the laddering of our debt maturities, refinance secured debt with unsecured debt, unencumbered assets and lower our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We ended the first quarter with over $1.3 billion in available liquidity comprised of our unrestricted cash and undrawn revolver capacity. We have no debt reaching final maturity before 2026, and at the end of the first quarter, over 99% of our debt was fixed rate or swapped to fixed rate, nearly three quarters of our debt was unsecured and over 83% of our homes were unencumbered. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved from 5.7 times at the end of 2022 to 5.5 times as of March 31st. In recognition of the great work by our team and the meaningful progress we have made -- in March, S&P Global Ratings upgraded our issuer and issue level credit ratings from BBB- to BBB flat. In addition, last week, Moody’s Investors Service revised our rating outlook from stable to positive. In closing, we have pleased to start the year strong and believe our favorable fundamentals, best-in-class operating platform, dedicated associates and strong balance sheet position us well to continue delivering solid results. On behalf of everyone at Invitation Homes, we extend our thanks to Ernie for the enormous impact he has made and look forward to furthering the legacy he helped build. With that, Operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is open. Josh Dennerlein, your line is open.
Josh Dennerlein: Oh! Hey. Sorry, guys. It’s Josh Dennerlein. Sorry about that. In the opening remarks, you mentioned demographics influencing demand and it sounds like you expect sector-leading NOI growth to kind of continue as a result. I guess could you maybe walk us through the demographics that you have seeing come through your portfolio today and how that’s impacting your outlook?
Dallas Tanner: Yeah. I think -- this is Dallas, by the way. One of the things we have been most bullish on has been the consistency around the fundamentals of who our customer is as they come in. The strength of what we would call the credit quality and the personal balance sheet, and I think lastly, the duration of stay. And as we have looked at our business over the last decade, literally quarter-over-quarter, we have seeing that duration and length of stay push well into the 40-ish type of months with us. As they move out, we have seeing that in our West Coast markets and we have seeing our eastern markets start to quickly kind of close the gap. And so I think as you think about this money of cohort, the types of things they want, the flexibility around choice leasing lifestyle. Charles talked about it in his opening remarks, this mobile-friendly kind of universe that we all operate in personally. It sets itself up to be very favorable for somebody who is looking for choice and flexibility while maintaining a down payment light approach. We have seeing continued strength in the underwriting of the customer, as I mentioned my second point, and it continues to be impressed upon us that our top of funnel and the demand side of our business is extremely healthy. We have a lot of intrigue in properties as they become available, we have a lot of pre-leasing activity and we have not seeing any real degradation in our customer as of today.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citibank. Your line is open.
Eric Wolfe: Thanks. Dallas, you have talked a lot about the lock-in effect on interest rates and what it’s doing to sale inventory, and ultimately, transactions. Just curious whether you can see anything that would change that going forward or should we ultimately just expect a pretty depressed level of acquisitions for a long time?
Dallas Tanner: Well, I think, there’s two questions in that question. So, the first piece on the lock-in effect with 80%-some-odd of mortgages being sub-5%. It has probably caused a lot of us and people that are in the market for housing to think about staying put, which I think has also impacted some of the resale supply. It’s had a positive effect in our business, because I also think it’s helping support longer duration of stay, demand, et cetera. I think in terms of your question around the retail market and what we would expect from sellers? Yeah, there’s no doubt that if people are a mortgage today, if you acquired it or you refinanced in the last 36 months is an asset for folks and so that may have an impact on resale supply. Good news for us is our focus the last couple of years has been building out a much more robust new product pipeline, which today sits close to $1 billion and we have really excited about that product as it’s coming into our portfolio, both this year and years beyond. I think the resale environment has been limited the last three years to four years. It hasn’t really been a source of truth for people as they have trying to build up, call it, their base. Fortunately, for us, we have real scale in markets. I think where we may see other opportunities down the road this year could be as we see some of these smaller operators who are having trouble getting scale or sizing up, there could be opportunities where potential M&A over the next couple of years. So I think we will stay aggressive in our new product pipeline, we have obviously always looking at things as the resale market changes but just being ready and I think we have in a position to do that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks and good morning. I am just curious if you guys are surprised at all by the strength in new lease rate growth year-to-date, which you highlighted has accelerated each month and surpassed renewals in April. And I am just wondering if that enables you to back a bit on renewals to limit turnover and help control costs and if you could provide an update on loss to lease, that would be helpful as well? Thank you.
Charles Young: Yeah. This is Charles. Thanks for the question. Yeah. Look, we have seen really healthy demand here in the first quarter and while we expected it to be solid, it’s a little bit out ahead of our expectations, which is great. The funnel is strong, we have been able to grow occupancy by 50 basis points from 97.3% to 97.8%, while as you mentioned, accelerating new lease rent growth. Renewals still have been really strong. We have been in the mid-7s and that’s slightly above where we thought we would be, and we have maintaining that in April in the 7s. And as you look forward, May and June, we went out in the mid-7s on our ask and we will see where that ends up. You have asking the right question, there is a balance here as we have seeing this demand and trying to balance off the lease compliance backlog that we have working through to make sure that we maintain strong occupancy. But right now we like our kind of balance that we have, the optimization and demand to catch up when we do turn over a home because we are slightly up on turnover, but historically, really low numbers still in the 22% so where we are. We will see how the summer plays out, we have slightly ahead of expectations and optimistic going into the summer. And then the last question around Los Alicia. We have in that -- as we updated it today about 5% to 6% loss to lease.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jamie Feldman: Yeah. Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could talk more about the expense side of your outlook. Any of the moving pieces that maybe you have a little bit less confidence in, whether it’s insurance, taxes, utilities, anything -- R&M, anything else we might want to think about here as the year unfolds? And also when you -- if you can give a date for when you did or you will renegotiate your insurance for the year? Thank you.
Jon Olsen: Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Jon. Our insurance policy period runs from March to February. So we have now put our new insurance policy in place. Recall that on our last call, we talked about our expectation for the property policy being up somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% to 25% year-over-year. The actual policy came in right in the middle of that range, actually a little bit closer to the bottom end and as we have talked about in the past, the other insurance line items showed smaller year-over-year increases. So our expectation for the balance of the year is that for the next three quarters, we will see the insurance line item be up in the neighborhood of 20% year-over-year and then for the full year, we would expect insurance to be up about 16% year-over-year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Brad Heffern: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. On the property tax front, I noticed that it was down 3% from the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what that’s related to, is it lower appraisals or appeal wins or is there something else going on there?
Jon Olsen: Actually, no. So recall that last year, in the fourth quarter, we talked about having been under accrued for property taxes in the first part of 2022 and so we had a fairly sizable catch-up entry in the fourth quarter. So what you can expect to see this year is much higher year-over-year property tax increases in the first three quarters of the year and then moderating in the fourth quarter and we have said that we expect property taxes to be up in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% for the full year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you. First, congrats to Jon and Charles for new roles. And Ernie, I guess, a lot you will be missed. To go back to your comments earlier on, I think, you mentioned you have working to find a responsible way to help add more supply. I am curious if you can elaborate on what that means, are you inclined to do more development partnerships or even do it on balance sheet? And if I could sneak in one, can you comment on the new SEC increase on page 55 of the 10-K, the inquiry into your compliance with building codes and permitting requirements? Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Haendel. I will comment briefly on your last, which is we don’t comment on any other legal matters other than to say that we always fully cooperate with any inquiries we get. In terms of new product pipeline and the opportunities there. Today, we have been really cautious and careful around not putting the balance sheet in a position where we would have to take maybe more of an egregious share of the risk in terms of how we want to build product. We really like our approach thus far. We are doing a lot of different underwrites and reviews on opportunities in the marketplace across a variety of builders and develop potential partners. It’s well noted that we have a really good partnership with Pulte Homes. We will continue to do as much with Pulte as we can. They have been terrific. And I would say that with the announcement of that partnership, what, roughly 18 months, 24 months ago, it’s expanded to many other builders and developers coming to us looking for opportunities to grow together. So we have been able to be deliberate, we have been able to be picky about where we want to invest and why, and I think we have been able to do it at a risk basis that is very variable to our shareholders in terms of not having an outsized portion of risk, a bunch of land sitting on our balance sheet, et cetera. And by the way, I’d just add, like very little G&A. It’s synonymous with our investment management team here. We have added a couple of people over time on the buss guest side and also on the project management side, but it’s going really well and we have coming into these homes a really accretive basis that we feel good about. Excited to see where that continued chapter for our company develops and has greater magnitude.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Adam Kramer: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and best wishes to you, Ernie. I appreciate all the help over the years. I just wanted to ask about bad debt on kind of a gross and net basis. Maybe just kind of walk us through how gross bad debt in 1Q compared to 4Q and then maybe the same for net. And then the areas where -- geographic areas, markets where you have still kind of worse than pre-COVID on kind of that gross bad debt line. Maybe just kind of highlight for us which markets are kind of still outliers on that basis?
Ernie Freedman: Yeah. With regard to -- this is Ernie. With regards to bad debt, we saw that our rent assistance that we received from the fourth quarter, the first quarter actually got cut in half. And so what’s happening is that we have seeing a good pick up and you can see what we reported in our earnings supplemental that for the first time in a while that zero to 30 payment is increasing and got to 93%. So we have actually seeing a nice improvement in the gross bad debt and not getting as much help from things like rents as we expected. And in fact, the collections coming forward the zero to 30 but were a little bit better than we had anticipated and we have able to clean up a little bit more than we anticipated in the first quarter. Hence we made the reference in our earnings release, that things came in a little bit better than we expected for the first part of the year and that certainly bodes well, but it’s early, too. So we don’t want to call it a trend yet, but we have certainly happy with where it’s at, not only for the first three months of the year, but for the first four months of the year. I will turn it over to Charles and he can talk a little bit about what we have seeing on a market-by-market basis.
Charles Young: Yeah. So, as Ernie said, we have starting to see kind of a return to normal and all trends are generally positive and this is why rent assistance has gone, was half of last quarter and 20% year-over-year. So we have starting to get back into a normal rhythm. In terms of markets, about half of our markets are operating at their historic levels, which are great. There are a few markets that, because of kind of the lease compliance backlog in the courts and that it’s a little slower SoCal being kind of the largest of that. But the L.A. County, L.A. City adjustment is favorable and we will see how that plays out. There’s still kind of the courts are backlog there. So it will take a little bit of time to clean up. The other markets that are a little slower are Atlanta Vegas, but that’s changing and adjusting quickly in NorCal Vista, California courts as well. Then we have another handful of markets that are trending in the right direction, but not quite back to historical levels. So, we feel like we have moving in the right direction and things are kind of working themselves out. And as we talked about on the last call, we knew bad debt was going to be elevated in the first half of the year and we have trending nicely, and we will see if we can continue to keep that momentum, and by the second half, we will be trending back towards where we want to be in cleaning this in.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Hey. Thanks for the time. Dallas, I want to circle back to the [inaudible] lawsuit. I know your views haven’t changed where you do not think it has merit, but curious if the internal views have changed at all when trying to size the potential impact, if you have wrong and things go South in court. So can you help us give us a sense of whether your views have changed on the potential financial impact for shareholders?
Dallas Tanner: There is no change in our views. And again, we have really careful guys. We don’t want to comment on any pending litigation. But, no, it’s just the same, John. And we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously and we believe that the claim is really without merit.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Tricarico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Daniel Tricarico: Thank you. Question on the builder pipeline, it looks as though some of the 2023 and 2024 deliveries were pushed out to the following year with the recent release. Can you comment on the different components driving that? Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: It’s just timing on projects more or less than anything. I think, by and large, everything that we expected to take from a delivery perspective this year is on schedule and then some of it has to do with timing in P&C and some of the zoning commission things that we mentioned in my earlier comments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. My apologies. Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. Thanks for the time. Just curious if you could speak a little bit more on the acquisition side. Are you seeing any potential distress from some larger portfolio owners given the change in rates and some financing may be coming due? And as part of that question, maybe if you can just comment on where you see cap rates today for assets that are transacting and how does that compare to your implant cap are thinking about your own cost of capital?
Dallas Tanner: Yeah. Hi, Juan, Dallas. First, on balance sheet, we don’t really love our current cost of capital and it feels like on a real estate basis that our current cost of capital is not truly being valued where it should be. I would say and we haven’t been shy about saying this, that we will continue to look to expand our joint venture business and raise outside capital, we can still buy really good real estate, both new product resell product, and I guess, potentially, you could say M&A, to your question and it’s terrific for the REIT. It created a bunch of fee structures, promotes and things that, ultimately, is FFO and AFFO drip for shareholders. It feels like the market today is on a new home basis, if you really wanted to buy volume, you have kind of in the low to mid-5s would be kind of on an in-place stabilized cap rate. I will go back to the earlier question, which is there aren’t a lot of meaningful opportunities there in the resale space. And I don’t think we have seen as much as people have wanted to think that residential was going to implode over the last year, we have seen really good price stability on the single-family housing side on a relative basis, because it was mentioned today in the Journal, new home construction is making up about a third of the resale market, which is about 50% higher than where it typically is in any given year. And so homebuilders have done a nice job of helping support a transaction market in a way because they have been able to buy down mortgage rates and things like that. So not seeing a lot of distress from operators. I do think there could be moments of opportunity, because if you don’t have enough scale, if you don’t have a significant portfolio today, I don’t want to say that they have stuck, but it’s going to be harder to grow. I think scale is going to be more beneficial over the next couple of years and it should benefit companies like ours in the REITs space where we have very low leverage and generally access and availability to different capital -- buckets of capital. And I think we have a good track record here over the last 12 years of finding ways to meaningfully grow and those opportunities in front of them -- front of us. So like I mentioned in my opening remarks, like, we feel like we have ready. We have got between, call it, current cash and ventures and availability of credit. We have got a couple of billion dollars of dry powder. We want to lean in when the right opportunities are in front of us, and right now it’s just been more of a capital recycling period.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Keegan Carl: Just on your JV dispositions, what was the driver and what was the average cap rate on what was sold?
Dallas Tanner: On the JV disposition, the question?
Ernie Freedman: On the JV dispositions. This is Ernie. The JV dispositions are from our legacy Fannie Mae joint venture and the plan for that joint venture over the next many years is slowly dispose of homes as they -- for the most part, when they have not renewing. And so you have just going to continue to see, I will call it, a drip of sales each quarter as they go forward. For other JVs, we just finished the investment period for the 2020 Rockpoint JV. So we have far off from doing any sales there. For the 2022 Rockpoint JV, we have still in the investment period there. And with regards to what we have been selling at a Fannie Mae, you see it’s a small number, it’s consistent what we have on the balance sheet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Dennis McGill: Hi. Thank you, guys. Dallas, I guess just going back to the transaction market, I’d be interested in what you think breaks the stalemate, because you have sitting here with a cap rate that’s not all that attractive, but fundamentals are good, you have able to sell at an easy cap rate, attractive cap rate, it doesn’t sound like inventory is going to be coming to market with a lock-in effect. So other than the long end of the curve coming down and debt costs coming down, which probably brings with it some economic challenges. What changes the confidence of everybody out there to just transact that this is the new norm?
Dallas Tanner: Well, I think, one, you want to have yields that make sense, right? I don’t think you want to see -- I don’t think our shareholders would want us to necessarily be super active buying yields that aren’t very accretive. I also think that there’s going to be, and look, you mentioned a stalemate. To be fair, the last year has been sort of tricky. I think it’s been tricky for private operators that are considering recaps or financing activities, et cetera. I think that will spur some opportunities for us. I also think we have got the right approach with our new product pipeline where those deliveries are going to start to stack at pretty meaningful yields even at today’s current cost of capital. So I think the opportunity will sort of play itself through the marketplace as either one of a handful of things happen. Your point on the long side of the curve comes in and credit availability maybe helps enhance some transaction activities, you see more in the retail space. But I also believe that the combination of our new product pipeline, potential M&A being a bit more active in the resale space as that starts to normalize will all lend itself to pretty normalized years for activity. It makes sense to me that a lot of single-family rental operators, you have read it kind of everywhere else have all taken a pause. We want to see what happens with housing prices. I think people are wanting to make sure that there’s stability and price durability in the marketplace. It feels like it’s there and I think now it’s just about identifying and executing on those opportunities.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Your line is open.
Steve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks. I think Charles had provided maybe the April renewal. I am just curious if I missed it, did you talk about where renewals were going out for May and June? And maybe secondly, could you just maybe comment on some of the larger occupancy drops like Las Vegas, and I guess, what are you seeing in some of the markets where the occupancy drop more than the portfolio average?
Charles Young: Yeah. Great question. I did share where we went on in renewals earlier. For May, we went out in the mid-7s and June kind of mid-to-high 7s and -- we expect that to be kind of stay where we have going right now. Given the demand and kind of where we are with the current occupancy, we have in healthy shape. To your other question, Vegas, I mentioned it earlier when we were talking about the lease compliance. It’s one of those markets that was having some bad debt challenges and that the backlog is starting to break there and so you have getting a little bit of a spike in turnover and so as we clean that up, it’s put some pressure on occupancy. The other kind of below average was in Minnesota. They had some earlier cleanup on the lease compliance over the winter and you also have in the colder markets, some seasonality that hit them a little harder. So those are two markets that. Again, high 96s are not bad and what we have starting to see is some increase in both of those markets as they go. So, with the healthy demand that we have seeing, generally, we feel like we will be able to kind of get to ship straight pretty quickly. The rest of the markets are running nicely in the high 97s to 98.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Choe with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Adam Hamilton: Hi. This is Adam on for Sam. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to circle back quickly to the lease growth discussion. We were really encouraged by the lease acceleration, especially on the new lease side going to peak leasing season. I was wondering if you have seen anything driving that demand besides the demographic shifts you have already discussed, and adjacent to that, you mentioned some technology upgrades. Are there any new initiatives that could possibly help ancillary revenue on that side?
Charles Young: Yeah. Overall funnel is really strong. I mean I think as you look at it, the general demand for our product, given our location, schools, safety, all of that. The other thing that does stand out is purchased -- move-out reasons to purchase a home is down, the lowest it’s been in a while. We have kind of balancing that with some of the turnover. But you look at current interest rates, it’s natural that people will -- who need a single-family home are going to come to us and that’s what we have seeing. About 80% are rented prior and about 77% are coming from a single-family home prior to coming to us. And so all of that is trending in a positive direction and gives us kind of good demand. And as we looked at kind of how we were able to accelerate through Q1, it does, as you said, put us in a healthy position going into the summer. Our thought, as we looked at this and we kind of set our perspective is that you got to be realistic to where we were the last couple of years and while we have going into it maybe a little ahead of time, we do feel like there’s going to be a peak here, it’s not going to rise to the sky like we did during COVID. But we like our position, given our occupancy and the acceleration that we have seen to date. So we feel real good about it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Lee [ph] in on behalf of Chandni. Thanks for the question. So could you talk more about the turnover expense overall, especially on the resident turnover, like, how much of it was from normal seasonality and inflation and how much of it was impacted by working through the nice units in California? And what’s your expectation on the growth for the rest of the year? Thanks.
Jon Olsen: Thanks. Great question. This is Jon. Look, on turnover, there are a few factors at play here. The first is that you have seeing a year-over-year increase in turnover rate and that’s related to what Charles walked through, which is the return of our markets to more normal course mechanisms related to delinquency resolution. The second component is that the average cost per turn on those delinquency turns, as we talked about on the last call, can be materially higher than a regular weight turn, sometimes to the effect of 40% to 50% more costly and it would follow that they are likely to also take a little bit longer. I think the other less influential factor is that, as Dallas talked about, with average length of stay elongating, you see a little bit more kind of normal wear and tear even in our regular way turns. But I think those are really the primary drivers coupled with continued inflationary pressure that we have seeing in our markets. As for the balance of the year, as we have talked about, we expect to see somewhat lower occupancy in 2023 than we did last year. That’s primarily related to our expectation for a little bit higher turnover and the expectation that it’s going to take us a little bit of time to work our way through our lease compliance backlog. But I think big picture, we have very optimistic about how the business is performing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW. Your line is open.
Jason Sabshon: Hi. This is Jason Sabshon on for Jade. Does levering new investments make sense at this point or is it best to stay in levered and figure out financing later on?
Jon Olsen: Look, I can defer some of -- this is Jon. But I would say we really like where our leverage profile is. We have worked hard to get it to a level where on a risk-adjusted basis, we have far better than we were 5 years ago when we -- when the business went public. I think we have used more leverage in some of our ventures and that’s sort of been my design and we have been programmatic and thoughtful about how to do that and when to do it. But I think, by and large, the cost to debt out there isn’t that great right now even for an unsecured borrower like ourselves. So I don’t see leverage being a significant part of our near strategy to go fund our growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking follow-up question. I guess I just wanted to get your thoughts on NOI margins. I mean year-over-year, they have clearly down in most markets sequentially, they have a little bit more mix, but definitely picked up for the portfolio overall. I mean, how do you see this trending through the course of the year or even beyond, now that you have got a better handle on the expense side, especially with insurance and taxes and a pretty good view on revenue as well?
Dallas Tanner: Yeah. I think it’s a good question. We have seeing a little bit elevated expense here in the first 3 quarters of this year for all the reasons we have talked about previously and that’s going to put a little bit of pressure on margin for us, at least for the first 3 quarters of 2023. I think over the long-term, what you have seen from our business is sort of a steady improvement in NOI margin over time, as we have able to extract more and more efficiencies in terms of how our property management platform operates, continue to harvest the benefits of our unrivaled scale in markets. So I think we continue to be bullish about our ability to drive NOI margin higher over the long-term.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. I just have one follow-up on the turnover and repair and maintenance conversation, Jon, so far this year and starting out in the spring and summer. The trajectory of R&M and turnover trying in line, better or worse than you originally expected heading into this year?
Jon Olsen: I think they have trending generally in line with what we have expected. I think, overall, we have performing relatively well, maybe a little bit ahead of our expectations for the year, but it’s early in the year, right? So we want to continue to see how things develop, but I would say that, we feel good about what we have seeing on the cost to maintain side of things.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citibank. Your line is open.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. It’s actually Nick Joseph here with Eric. One of your Sun Belt or one of the Sun Belt department companies mentioned on their call that you thought the starts had come down about 60% from current levels. So wondering kind of historically, when you have seen big swings in apartment deliveries, what’s the impact on single-family rental operations?
Dallas Tanner: That’s an interesting question. We haven’t seen a lot of it and there’s sort of two things on there. One, our customers are a little bit different. I mentioned duration of stay and Charles talked about it as well that we have customers that are anchoring around schools and transportation quarters, so the customer profile is a little bit different. And then on a price per square foot, SFR is so much more affordable, generally speaking, than comparative multifamily. So it’s really not an apples-to-apples comparison.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gorman with BTIG. Your line is open.
Michael Gorman: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Sorry if I missed it, but I just wanted to double check. I know you maintained your operating guidance for the full year for operating expenses. Should we expect any kind of outsized impact in the second quarter just because of some of the extreme weather we have seen, especially in some of like the Florida market? Does that change how you have thinking about the progression of operating expenses throughout the year, even within the maintained guidance?
Jon Olsen: No. I don’t think we have anticipating a material impact related to weather patterns. I think right now what we have seeing in the business is a business that is sort of recalibrating as some of the structural impediments to us operating the way we normally would work themselves out over time. I think weather is something that we are always going to have to deal with. I think we feel good about the processes we have in place, the ground game that we rollout to make sure that we are protecting our assets and that we have well insured in the event of some sort of catastrophic events. But I would say that the impact is not expected to be significant.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Anthony Powell: Hi. Thank you. Question on Phoenix and Tampa. I think two markets that people were concerned about given a lot of the supply growth both on the multifamily and the single-family side. Are you seeing very strong rent growth there, so maybe comment on those two markets?
Charles Young: Yeah. This is Charles. I can jump in. Yeah. Tampa has been really strong for us. Its new lease rent growth of north of 8% in Q1 and maintaining on the renewal side in the mid-8%. Phoenix, while Q4 was a little down relative to the kind of high flying we had last year. You can see it’s quickly kind of bounced back and we have at the 98% occupancy and new lease rent growth at 6.3% and so in our top five as we look at the numbers. So to your point, it’s one of the -- Phoenix is a resilient market and we were able to bounce back, and we have great operators there. So -- and Tampa as well. So two strong markets for us as we look at it, most of Florida has been really strong. The demand is really there as we think about demographic changes.
Operator: This completes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: We appreciate everybody’s participation and look forward to seeing everyone at upcoming conferences. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-16 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Invitation Homes Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Scott McLaughlin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Scott McLaughlin: Good morning, and welcome. Today, we'll hear remarks from Dallas Tanner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer; and Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer. Following these remarks, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session with our covering sell-side analysts. [Operator Instructions] During today's call, we may reference our fourth quarter 2022 earnings release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other nonhistorical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, in yesterday's earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Dallas.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks for joining us this morning. I'd like to start by thanking all of our teams for their hard work last year. Yesterday, we posted 2022 year-over-year core FFO growth of 11.6% and same-store NOI growth of 9.1%. Strong demand for our business continued throughout the year. And despite some headwinds from inflation and an evolving regulatory environment, we believe our business continues to stand on solid footing. As you all know, Ernie recently announced that he'll be stepping down as CFO in a few months. I'd like to thank him for his extraordinary vision and strategic insight over the past seven years, and I look forward to celebrating his achievements later this year. At the same time, I'm excited for Jon Olsen, who joins us here in the room this morning, to lead our finance team beginning in June. Jon has been part of Invitation Homes from the beginning with deep involvement in all of our strategic and financial activities. We expect this to be a seamless transition. Before turning it over to Charles and Ernie to provide more details about our 2022 performance and our expectations for 2023, I wanted to take a few moments to discuss the current housing environment in the United States and how we believe Invitation Homes is well positioned to help support the country's housing needs. It has been reported that the U.S. needs to add more than 13 million housing units over the next seven years in order to accommodate new household formation and address the undersupply of the past decade. Today, however, it remains challenging to deliver new supply in desirable locations, because of state and local restriction, as well as labor and material shortages. In addition, today's macroeconomic environment of higher inflation and higher interest rates may discourage investment in new supply. On top of these supply pressures, the largest demographic group, the millennial generation, is now aging in the life stage of needing more space to accommodate their families and their lifestyles. Add to all of that, the increased flexibility of many to work part-time or full-time from home, and we believe demand for single-family housing should remain strong for many years to come. At the core of our business is a straightforward yet critical goal. We seek to be a meaningful part of the solution for high-quality and flexible housing options. We provide quality homes for lease in desirable locations with access to great schools and employment centers. We offer best-in-class service, allowing residents to focus on their lives. And we're proud that we partner with 150 public housing authorities and serving thousands of our residents who participate in a housing assistance program, including HUD's housing choice voucher program. And we're delivering new homes to marketplace through our previously announced builder relationships. Today, that builder pipeline exceeds 2,300 homes that we expect to deliver over the next few years, and our plans are to continue investing in new construction in the future. As a reminder, our approach to bringing new housing to the marketplace keeps development risk off of our balance sheet and avoid any related G&A burden, while also allowing us to partner with some of the best homebuilders in the business to select and buy new homes in great locations. We think this approach is a real differentiator and allows us to maximize flexibility and optionality while remaining opportunistic and minimizing risk. All of this is important because the lack of available supply of single-family housing and strong demand from those who wish to live in a single-family home have made homeownership much more expensive today. This supply and demand imbalance is further aggravated by inflation and elevated interest rates, leading to the widest dislocation we've seen between the cost of homeownership and the cost of leasing since starting this business. We're therefore very proud to provide our residents the opportunity to live in neighborhoods and school districts that might not otherwise be accessible at a cost that is often significantly more affordable than any other housing option. Let me pull on that string a little bit further. Based on the John Burns December data, leasing a home cost nearly $900 less each month than owning a home across our markets. This means that leasing home can save a family nearly 30% a month on their housing costs on average. These savings are even more compelling on a per square foot basis where single-family rental homes currently come out as the most cost-effective housing option compared to not only homeownership costs, but also apartment rent. That being the case, we believe today's macroeconomic environment and the current supply and demand fundamentals make the Invitation Homes value proposition compelling for both our residents and our shareholders. This is on top of several differentiators of our business that we have noticed in the past. For residents, these benefits include a recently renovated, refreshed or newly built home in a desirable location; ProCare, which is our resident service model that provides for consistent interactions with our residents throughout their time with us; best-in-class technology tools of the most recent example being our mobile maintenance app, offering residents an even more efficient process to submit service requests; and a growing list of resident services designed to elevate their living experience. For our shareholders, we believe there are numerous absolute and relative advantages to the single-family rental industry, including single-family homes are the most liquid real estate sector within the United States. There's typically much lower turnover in single-family rental than in multifamily with residents often staying much longer. And there's a long track record of rent growth within SFR even during recessionary periods. With a nod again to the Burns data, national average single-family rent growth has never had a meaningful decline in nearly 40-years of tracking that data. Lastly, we believe there are numerous advantages to the Invitation Homes way, including our hallmark scale; location and ISO markets, overseen by the best operators in the space as evidenced by our 46.6% cumulative same-store NOI growth rate from 2017 to 2022, nearly 2,500 basis points greater than the average of our residential peers; our strong balance sheet with no debt coming due until 2026; and our builder partner growth pipeline that maximizes flexibility and contributes to new housing supply while also avoiding big investments in land and a large G&A load. In closing, we couldn't be more excited about our real estate, our teams and the underlying fundamentals here in 2023, a year with some uncertainty and also a year we believe full of opportunity to continue delivering a premier resident experience to anyone who chooses to live a more flexible and worry-free lifestyle. With that, I'll pass it on to Charles, our Chief Operating Officer.
Charles Young: Good morning, everyone. As Dallas mentioned earlier, 2022 is a solid year for us. We believe our results are a reflection of the service we offer our residents and our performance in providing an exceptional leasing experience. This is an ongoing journey that we look forward to continuing in 2023. So thank you to all of our associates for your constant commitment to genuine care. I'll now walk you through our operating results in more detail. Same-store core revenues grew 7.6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This increase was driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 9.4% and a 16% increase in other property income, net of resident recoveries. Same-store average occupancy was 97.3% in the fourth quarter, down 80 basis points year-over-year as a result of higher vacancy due to increased turnover. For the full-year 2022, our same-store revenue grew by 9%. Same-store core expenses grew 16.3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. The main driver of this growth was an 18.3% increase in property tax expense. As indicated a few months ago, this increase was anticipated to be outsized due to a catch-up to our property tax accrual in the fourth quarter primarily related to higher property tax bills in our homes in Florida and Georgia. For full-year 2022, including this fourth quarter count, property tax expense grew by 7.8%, while core operating expense for the full-year 2022 were up 8.6%. Outside of property taxes, the inflationary environment was the largest contributor to the higher growth in core operating expenses. Following two years in a row of virtually no expense growth year-over-year, our expectation that we will see some of last year's inflationary pressure continue into 2023. Finishing up with our same-store operating results, we reported fourth quarter NOI growth of 3.7%, which brought our full-year 2022 NOI growth to 9.1%. Next, I'll cover leasing trends in the fourth quarter of 2022 and January 2023. Same-store blended rent growth was 9.1% in the fourth quarter, which is comprised of renewal rent growth of 9.9% and new lease rent growth of 7.4%. In January 2023, same-store blended rent growth was 7.4% with renewals coming in at 8.7% and new leases at 4.9%. Same-store occupancy in January was 97.7%, an increase of 40 basis points from our fourth quarter results. As we anticipated, bad debt was a stronger headwind in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, representing 2% of gross rental revenues. California, and more specifically, Southern California continued to experienced outsized bad debt within our portfolio. Approximately 40% of our Southern California homes are located within Los Angeles County, where ordinances continue to restrict residential lease compliance options. For the remainder of our portfolio, we are seeing some markets return to more regular procedures for addressing delinquency, though it's a slower process now than it has been historically in some of our markets. Across all our markets, we're proud to offer a desirable housing option and worry-free lifestyle to our residents. In our most recent resident surveys, we heard that the need for more space and desirable location of our homes were once again the top two reasons why new residents choose to lease from us in the fourth quarter. 80% of new resident surveys indicate it's important to have a home office or bonus room with nearly half stating they work from home at least two days a week. In addition, our average household income for new residents during 2022 remain healthy at approximately $134,000, representing an income to rent ratio of 5.2 times. Finally, our residents continued to demonstrate high satisfaction with the service our teams are providing as evidenced by our high occupancy, low turnover, average length of stay of nearly three years and strong resident satisfaction scores. I extend my thanks to our teams who have helped make this all possible. And I challenge our associates to continue to raise the bar here in 2023. I'll now turn the call over to Ernie, our Chief Financial Officer.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you, Charles. This morning, I will cover the following topics: one, balance sheet and capital markets activity; two, financial results for the fourth quarter; and three, our 2023 guidance, which we introduced in yesterday's earnings release. Since our IPO in 2017, we have been focused on reducing our overall leverage, improving our maturity ladder, achieving an investment-grade rating and transitioning to a balance sheet that is capitalized mostly with unsecured debt at fixed rates. We have made significant progress across all of these objectives. At year-end 2022, net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 5.7 times. Our weighted average maturity was 5.6 years, and when considering available extension options, we have no debt coming due until 2026. Over 99% of our debt was fixed rate or swapped to fixed rate. We achieved our investment-grade rating in the spring of 2021. And at year-end 2022, over 83% of our homes were unencumbered, and 73.7% of our debt was unsecured with secured debt representing less than 10% of gross book value of our real estate. As previously announced, during the fourth quarter, we prepaid the remaining portion of our IH 2018-1 securitization using the delayed draw feature of our seven-year unsecured term loan that closed in June 2022. We ended the year with $1.3 billion of liquidity from both our undrawn revolver and unrestricted cash. I'll now cover our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial results. Core FFO for the fourth quarter increased 10.6% year-over-year to $0.43 per share, and AFFO increased 9.2% to $0.36 per share. For the full-year 2022, core FFO and AFFO per share increased 11.6% and 10.2% to $1.67 and $1.41, respectively, each exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Included in our earnings release, we provided a bridge from 2022 core FFO per share to the midpoint of 2023 core FFO per share guidance. With regards to our same-store operating metrics, we expect same-store core revenue growth in a range of 5.25% to 6.25%. Embedded in our guidance are the following assumptions: first, slightly lower average occupancy versus 2022 due to anticipated higher turnover; and second, elevated bad debt of 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2022. Next, same-store core expense growth, which we expect in the range of 7.5% to 9.5%. Included in this guidance is the assumption that real estate taxes will increase between 6.5% to 7.5%, an improvement from 2022. We also expect to see pressure on turnover, operating and capital expense, due mainly to our assumption of higher turnover in 2023, along with our assumption around ongoing inflationary pressures. As Charles mentioned, our real estate tax expense in 2022 was underaccrued for the first three quarters of 2022. So we recorded an outsized catch-up in the fourth quarter of 2022. As a result, we anticipate 2023 same-store core expense growth in the mid-teens for the first quarter of 2023 followed by sequential improvement during the remainder of the year, resulting in the expected range for the full-year 2023. Taken together, this brings our expectation for same-store NOI growth to 4.0% to 5.5%. We also expect full-year 2023 core FFO per share to be in the range of $1.73 to $1.81 and AFFO per share in the range of $1.43 to $1.51. As a result of this anticipated growth in AFFO per share in 2023, our Board of Directors has authorized an increase in our quarterly dividend by 18.2% to $0.26 per share. Our guidance assumes that our 2023 acquisitions will be modest. This includes our initial expectation for on-balance sheet acquisitions of $250 million to $300 million from our builder partners, which we plan to fund through free cash flow and disposition proceeds. It also includes our expectation for acquisitions in our joint ventures of $100 million to $300 million. Outside of this guidance assumption, our actual acquisition activity will be based on how attractive the buying opportunities are relative to our cost of capital as the year progresses. With our balance sheet in excellent shape, our ample liquidity providing us with plenty of dry powder and our joint ventures offering us access to additional capital, we're well positioned with the flexibility to maintain an opportunistic approach to external growth this year. I'll wrap up by echoing Dallas' and Charles' gratitude to our associates. They continually work hard to deliver strong results and to respectfully care for our residents in our homes. As we look ahead, we are confident in our continued success based on favorable supply and demand fundamentals, our healthy balance sheet, our unwavering commitment to outstanding resident service, our strong team and our desire to remain the premier choice in home leasing. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have the first question on the phone lines from Josh Dennerlein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Josh Dennerlein: Yes. Hey guys, thanks for the question. Just kind of thinking about your AFFO midpoint guide with the FFO midpoint guide, it looks like it's kind of 83% of FFO. I think it was 84% for 2022 actuals. What -- it looks like before that; it was kind of running at a smaller gap. Kind of what's driving that, but maybe it would have shrunk given lower turnover the last few years?
Ernie Freedman: Yes, Josh, this is Ernie. We are seeing -- and Charles talked about it and alluded to it with regards to inflationary pressures on turnover expenses. And so the difference between FFO and AFFO is going to be our capital replacement spending. We are seeing a little more pressure on the capital side on both our repairs and maintenance expenses as well as on our turn expenses. And we want to make sure at the beginning of the year, we had the right amount of caution built into our numbers. So we can hopefully set ourselves up for -- we hope to have a good performance later in the year off of that. That's why you've seen over the last couple of years, that's changed a bit. We're basically running closer to flattish net cost to maintain on the OpEx and CapEx combined for the last couple of years. But for 2022 and what we're projecting for 2023 is certainly a higher increase from inflationary pressures. And specifically in turnover, we do expect to have high -- a little bit higher turnover in 2023 versus 2022. Maybe as we get out into 2024 and 2025, you'll see numbers revert back to what you saw in the past for us in terms of the differences between core FFO and AFFO.
Josh Dennerlein: Thanks, Ernie. Appreciate that.
Ernie Freedman: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: We now have Nicholas Joseph of Citi. Your line is open.
Nicholas Joseph: Thank you. I was hoping you can elaborate a bit more on the trends you're seeing in the acquisition market in terms of cap rates and available properties. And then what are you hearing from your JV partners on their appetite to deploy capital in this current acquisition environment?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Nick, Dallas. Let me answer your second question first, and then I'll talk a little bit about what we're seeing in real time. I think there's plenty of appetite with our JV partners to continue to grow and find compelling ways to invest capital. I think the -- well, I know that to be the case. I think what I would add from a supply perspective is things are still relatively tight. If you go back to a year ago, we were kind of buying in the kind of low to mid-5s from a cap rate perspective. I think we've seen that move on the ground in the resale environment, maybe 20 or 30 basis points is kind of a mid-5-ish kind of market, 5.5, 5.6 for kind of like-kind product. Now that being said, there's also the least amount of resale supply inventory in the market that we've seen in the last three to four years. So it's a really interesting moment. The newer build stuff that seems to be coming online, both things that we're taking from a delivery perspective, conversations we're having with builders, I think the return profile is a little bit better. But those are going to be fewer -- not fewer and far between, but there's just going to be, I think, more angst on the builder side to lean out in sort of an uncertain environment, given where interest rates and things are. So all things being equal, plenty of capital interested in investing, not a tremendous amount of opportunity real time. But we expect that to kind of moderate throughout the year. I think we got to see what happens with mortgage rates. I think as of yesterday, there were a 30-year was closer to like a [6.75] (ph) number. And I think builders have been able to basically buy down mortgage rates to stay pretty competitive in the near-term. Let's see what happens there. I think we may have more of an opportunity, hopefully, over the year if mortgage rates creep up. And then we're definitely going to watch resale supply and how that's impacted by the labor market. Operator?
Scott McLaughlin: Operator, our next question, please.
Operator: We now have the next question from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hey, good morning, everybody. I was just curious if you could provide a little bit of an update of sort of what you're seeing on the ground and whether there's anything giving you pause in any of your markets that kind of has you taking a more conservative outlook through the balance of this year? And then just maybe a quick update on how market rents have trended from kind of late last year into the early part of this year.
Charles Young: Yes, this is Charles. Thanks for the question. Yes, we like what we're seeing on the ground right now. Our Q4 results showed a bit of the seasonality that we saw towards the middle of last year. And as expected, we kind of got back to that normal curve. During COVID, we -- it was kind of 98% across the board and really high rent growth. So we're seeing more seasonality. But what the reality of it is it's still really strong given the time of year. So looking at Q4 at 97.3% occupancy, that increased throughout the quarter. So we ended December at 97.4% and came into January 97.7%. So showing real strong demand that we're seeing on the ground. As we look at rates in Q4, a blended 9.1%, renewal at 9.9% and new at 7.4%. As you would expect with seasonality, January and December will be a little lower, but given that, a 4.9% new lease rent growth in January is really strong historically. Couple that with the 97.7% occupancy and 8.7% on the renewal side, we think the portfolio is really well positioned going into peak season, which typically starts right here after the Super Bowl. And we're seeing some acceleration in February on the new lease side. So across the board, it's looking good. There's more seasonality in the colder markets, the Denver and Chicago and the like, but we're still seeing a lot of strength in our Florida markets. Arizona had a bit of a slowdown with the seasonality, but it's starting to show some real momentum. So we're seeing some good stuff across the board. And we're leaning and feel good about where the portfolio is structured.
Operator: Thank you. We now have the next question from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Brad Heffern: Hey, good morning, everyone. Ernie, could you walk through the buildup to the revenue guidance as far as earn-in, loss to lease, occupancy, all the sort of moving pieces that get you there?
Ernie Freedman: Yes, sure. So Brad, we talked about in our -- in the prepared remarks as well as in the earnings release, a couple of the items, one with -- and I'll talk about kind of the midpoint of the guidance range, Brad. At the midpoint of guidance, we do expect down a little bit year-over-year. I think we're in 2022, we're at 97.7%, 97.8%. I think that's going to come down a little bit. It has to do mostly with the fact we think turnover is going to be a little bit higher. And we talked about that as well in terms of -- as we're able to finally to make some more progress on residents, who haven't been keeping current with the rents. We do expect turnover to tick up some, and that's why you're going to see occupancy come down. The other thing -- the other material mover on the negative side for us with regards to -- for growth on revenues is going to be bad debt. And we're certainly facing a lot of the challenges that other folks are out there who have exposure to Southern California. We do expect that bad debt is going to be up anywhere between 25 basis points and 75 basis points from where it was in 2022. So roughly at the midpoint about 2% where we came in at about 1.5% for the year for 2022. We do think that's going to be elevated a little bit more in the first half of 2023. And we do -- we see a path that we can start getting a little bit better for us in the second half of the year. The last thing I'd say, the other two pieces that are important with our other income. And we think other income is going to be up again low double-digits, similar to what it was last year as we continue to make progress on our ancillary income items. And finally, with rates, our earn-in -- we talked about it on our last call, our earn-in as we got into the year, we expect it to be about 4% from the activity that was done in 2022, and that didn't change in the fourth quarter. We did see the loss to lease shrink significantly from where it was at the end of the third quarter, where it was at the end of the fourth quarter. The loss to lease going into the year is about 1% to 2%. And we saw that decrease for a couple of reasons, Brad. One was just leasing activity. We started to catch up to that. But two, and Charles talked about it, typical seasonal patterns for folks in the residential business, and we're no different than a single-family is that you actually -- in a typical seasonal year, you'll see some sequential declines month-over-month in rental rate. Now we didn't see that in ‘21. We really didn't see much of that in 2020. But in 2022, it did come back. And so we did see some sequential declines as we went from September to October to November to December with regards to where overall rate was. And so that's why the combination of those two things have brought loss to lease down. If you take that all into consideration and our expectations around what leasing activity is going to look like for renewal and new in this year in 2023, you get to our guidance range that we had provided with regards to where we thought same-store core revenues will go out. We feel optimistic that we have an opportunity to maybe do a little bit better, and we're certainly going to try hard to do that. But we want to make sure we set the ground the right way at the beginning of the year. And hopefully, we have a year like we've had in the past where we have underpromised and overdelivered, but we'll just have to see how that plays out.
Operator: We now have Sam Choe with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Sam Choe: Hi, guys. Just was wondering if you could provide an update on your general thoughts on utilizing concessions and what that might look like during peak leasing season.
Charles Young: Yes. We have no concessions running at all. I think we talked about on our last call, we had a short-term kind of small concessions going into the holiday to try to push up on the occupancy as we saw seasonality come back. That's typical that we run in that time of year, given the seasonal curve. But as of December, we had no concessions, and we don't see any need to do it, given our current occupancy and the demand that we're seeing right now.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.
Steve Sakwa: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Dallas, I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit more on some of the builder relationships. And given the challenges that they're facing in actual home sales, I just didn't know if bulk sales and a bigger commitment from you to them to take down homes was more in the offering here and how those discussions have maybe unfolded.
Dallas Tanner: Steve, first of all, our pipeline today sits at about 2,300 homes that we have in contract with our different builder partners. And we're working right now with five to 10 builders, kind of, nationally and regionally across a variety of opportunities. Obviously, everybody is familiar with our strategic structure with Pulte. We'd like to build as many homes with them. They've been a terrific partner, and they have a great team. It's interesting, Steve. We sort of -- there was a lot of unknowns going into summer last year around kind of volatility of what was going to happen with rate. I think what we've seen most builders, as I mentioned before, do really well is kind of navigate the mortgage and the payment side of things without having to discount pricing too much. There's certainly kind of quarter-end stuff where we've had some small opportunities. But I think time will tell, and it's largely dependent on what happens with the labor market. If things continue to slow down, I would view that as a very good opportunity for Invitation Homes in terms of building out a much wider and longer pipeline across purpose-built construction that will come into our portfolio. We are now coming out of the ground with some of our first kind of full communities. We are touring one last week in Atlanta, in fact. And very pleased with the not only quality of the product, but the return profile and the demand, as Charles mentioned, top of funnels really. So Steve, our approach going into ‘23 would be that we're going to look opportunistically to enhance and grow that pipeline and also those relationships, find ways to do things more programmatically with our preferred partners. And obviously, if things slow down, that would be, I think, viewed as a good thing for SFR. Now it will depend on how we pay for those things going forward. But we've got plenty of, as I mentioned before, third-party capital that would like to look at these opportunities with us. And we'd also like to invest as accretively as we can on the balance sheet.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, thanks. Just maybe a question, I guess, for Ernie, just on the rate side of the same-store revenue equation for ‘23 guidance. Just curious if you can comment on assumed market rent growth across your portfolio in ’23. And maybe how you should -- how we should expect renewals to trend, given the moderating loss to lease. Do you think they could stay pretty sticky around the high single digits for the course of ‘23? Or should we expect that to moderate as well?
Ernie Freedman: Yes, implicit in our guidance and when I walk through the pieces, Juan, is that we're looking at -- for growth on rate, blended rate to be kind of in the mid-single-digits. I think honestly, that's probably we have the best most upside opportunity with regard to our revenue. And we are going to be able to cautious is on the bad debt side. We got burned a little bit by that last year. I think we've built enough into our guidance that we're probably okay there, but I want to be cautious there and balance those two. So I do think on the renewal side, we certainly have the opportunity to continue to stay at elevated levels, but it's hard to say that I would say at the high-digits for the entire year. So I'd be cautious to say that would be more towards the high-end of our guidance range or even a little bit higher. We feel very good about having some strong renewal growth throughout the rest of the year. But -- and we put up some strong numbers here in January, and I wouldn't extrapolate that for the rest of the year. But it's certainly possible if the market -- the designs that we're seeing in the market is pretty strong. There's a possibility that could happen. But I think if you do the math and how things will play out and taking consideration the number of 2-year leases we have, you'd solve to a number that gets to kind of the mid-single digits for blended growth rate for 2023.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Adam Kramer of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead when you are ready Adam.
Adam Kramer: Hey, I just want to follow-up on an earlier question around JVs. Look, I think there's been some kind of news in the press last kind of number of months about maybe JVs being more of an avenue that you guys would pursue. Certainly, a challenging environment for acquisitions in 2023 overall. Wondering just kind of the willingness or desire to maybe go that route. Obviously, you could pick up a little bit of fee income and change the economics a little bit in the model. So yes, I guess, just kind of generally around willingness to kind of go further down the JV path?
Dallas Tanner: This is Dallas. I mean, look, we've shown a willingness. We, in the last couple of years, have raised a couple of ventures both with Rockpoint as a strategic partner. You're exactly right that it does have a lot of value add to the REIT in both terms of, call it, our returns on our cost of capital off balance sheet and then also the fee generation and kind of additional service opportunities it creates as we build out a little bit more robust manager. And so I would expect the joint venture capital will always be something that we look at on a relative basis to where our current cost of capital is from a balance sheet perspective. Don't get me wrong, we would love to invest as much capital on balance sheet as we can. Obviously, at today's prices and the way that the book has been discounted in the public markets, that cost of capital is not very attractive. And so I think using third-party avenues or having longer-term partners that we can continually deploy capital with is a very good thing for our business and for our shareholders. We generate outsized returns. It also allows us to be a little bit more particular niche across maybe a couple of different areas. And we think that, that will also give the company in its strategic thinking a lot more flexibility over time. So I would expect us to continue to explore and use venues like joint ventures over time but never at a way that it would impact our ability to grow our balance sheet and always trying to find that right balance.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Chandni Luthra of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Chandni Luthra: HI, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to talk about property taxes a little bit. So your guidance assumes real estate taxes will increase 7%, and that's an improvement from 2022. What's the driver behind this expectation of improvement in the growth rate? Are there certain markets that make you think that basically tax growth will moderate? Anything going on more specific or more idiosyncratic anywhere? Would love your thoughts there.
Ernie Freedman: Yes, Chandni, it's Ernie. Happy to talk about the real estate taxes. So as a reminder to everyone on the call, for us, when you think about real estate tax, you want to think about our three largest markets where we pay the most taxes, which are Florida, California and Georgia, and we talked about that in the last quarter. California, we can kind of take off the table because of Prop 13. So that's always going to be a lower rate year-over-year. And there'll be some noise around appeals and things like that even within California. For Florida, we're not -- I know we're wrong last year, but we're not anticipating another year of tax bills being up 20% or about 14% last year with assessments being up almost 30% last year. Similar story with Georgia. We're not expecting a second back-to-back year with it as high as it was before. In Florida, there is some relief for folks as to how much can get pushed through in one year. There are some caps on two-thirds of your tax bill. Said another way, because assessments were so high, we'll probably bump up against those caps again in Florida for that two-thirds piece. But when you kind of do the math on Florida, California and Georgia, we think we'll be in a better position than we were in 2022. And those three combined are about 70% of our tax bill. We do have some other areas that we do think we have some significant increases from prior year. But again, because they're smaller tax bills for us, it's not as impactful, Maciver County in Charlotte will be an example where we will see some pressure there, because revaluations happen not on an annual basis, but a multiyear basis. You say the same thing about Denver, where we'll have that challenge as well. Again, the tax bill is in Colorado as well as the tax bills in North Carolina aren't as material to us. And then finally, we did see large tax bills in Texas as well. But for us, Texas is not a material player. I wouldn't be surprised if Texas has another rough year in 2023. But again, for us because our exposure is small, it's not going to have the impact on us that it might have on others. So overall, that's why we basically come in with the year, Chandni that we think is going to be pretty similar to what last year. Last year was, as you pointed out, it was 7.8%. This year, we're guiding 6.5% to 7.5%. So those are still historically really high numbers for us, but we do see a path that things might get a little bit better. And then importantly, with taxes, in case I think people are thinking about it, we really haven't baked in very much in terms of appeal wins. So if we do see some material appeal wins, that could help us get us to the lower end of our range. But we'll just have to see how that plays out. Those are certainly very hard to predict, but we don't need to have material appeal wins to get to the range that we've provided in our guidance.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. Your line is open, Keegan.
Keegan Carl: Hey, thanks, guys. So I know you gave the percent breakout as far as shares go. But I'm just curious if you could give us a little bit more breakout on your growth expectations between growth, property management and G&A for ’23?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. We noted on the -- in the -- if you look at our supplemental schedule, we gave a walk of FFO from 2022 to the midpoint of our guidance in 2023. And we had pointed out that we thought that property management expense line would grow about $0.03. So for us, that's about $17 million, $18 million. A lot of that is the continued investment in our technology platform. Part of that is the continued growth of our joint venture. So as we get more income from our joint ventures with regards to property management fees, we have property management expense offsetting that because of a number of homes. And then on top of that, we just have some inflationary pressures. We also ran a little bit understaffed in the first part of 2022. I think a lot of organizations were challenged with filling positions, and we're assuming a more full headcount in 2023. We'll see how that comes to play. But those are the main factors in terms of with regards to that. And specifically on our P&L, we do break out property management separate from G&A. And we'll see a little bit more of that growth on the property management side, but it's going to be more proportionate this year. If you look at ‘22 to ‘21, G&A was relatively flat, and most of the growth we had in those combined items came from property management. This year in 2023 compared to 2022, it's going to be closer to being even growth, but a little bit more on the property management side versus the G&A line.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Tyler Batory of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Tyler Batory: Good morning. Thank you. So just on the operating cost side of things, I really just want to tie the loop on this topic. I mean, ex property taxes, when we look at same-store OpEx, I just want to be clear on the drivers of that, quite a bit of growth there. How much of that is due to higher turnover? How much of that is due to just general cost inflation? And really, what I'm trying to get at, has there been a structural change in terms of the cost structure? I think there was always a concern with your business model that it would be difficult to scale. So I'm not sure if perhaps this outlook here indication that maybe some just economies of scale creeping in your business model, just given your size and the age of some of your homes?
Ernie Freedman: Tyler, it’s Ernie. I appreciate you asking because if you have that concern, other people might have that concern as well. And the answer is no, we're not seeing any concerns with having dissynergies from the size of the organization. I think that's helping us. I can certainly walk through some of the details, but you're right to point out that we're guiding real estate taxes to be up about 7% at the midpoint, but we're guiding overall, which is a little bit more than half of our overall expenses. Overall, we're guiding to a number that's about 8.5% at the midpoint. So that means everything else is going up a little bit more. So I think most of that, and I'll walk you through the details, we believe are more transitory items based on the circumstances where we're at right now in the marketplace. I'll just go through some of the material items in there. One was insurance costs. I don't think anyone is surprised in the environment hearing, but others, but property insurance rates are certainly going to go up. We'll finish our renewal here in about three weeks. So we don't have the final numbers on that. But in the last two years, our property insurance only went up combined about 3% or 4%. It was 0% one year, about 7% or 8% the next year. So we did much better than the broader residential. But with the cost of reinsurance treaties going way up this year, and certainly, of course, the events that happened in 2022, insurance costs are going to go up. We don't think that's a permanent issue. We think that's a onetime issue. I wouldn't be surprised if property insurance rates go up as much as 20% to 25%, which would bring our overall insurance costs up somewhere into the low double-digits, because the good news on other insurance lines, we're not seeing those kind of increases. The ones that are more material for us, Tyler, are really around turnover. And a couple of things with turnover. One, there are inflationary pressures. We do think those will subside as you get later into 2023 and 2024, but we're still in an inflationary environment there. The other items that really point out with turnover are two important things. One, we do think turnover is going to go up. And we think that's a good thing. Turnover is going to -- because we think we're going to have a better opportunity in 2023 than we had in 2022 for residents who have been delinquent in making rental payments, not paying the rent, we expect to see more activity there in people moving out homes. And so we do think turnover is going to go up for that reason. We think that's more of a transitory item and work itself out as we get later into 2023 and maybe a little bit of hangover in 2024 because of Southern California. The other item, though, is those residents I just alluded to, they've typically been in our houses longer. Often, they don't allow us to come in to do repair and maintenance work. They don't call in service requests as often as our residents, who are keeping current in their rent. And so when we go in to do the turns on those homes, those turns are materially more expensive than a regular way turn, sometimes as much as 40% to 50% more on average than our regular turn. So as we're dealing with those residents, Tyler, that are -- have been treating the houses the way they have and have not been paying the rents, we again think that it's more of a 2023 event. It goes away in 2024 in terms of our cost per turn, having a much more higher growth rate than we've seen in the past. So we don't think that's an issue with -- if you think about the long-term thoughts about what expense growth is going to be. So summarizing real-quickly, we think that's more of a specific ‘23 issue. We think property taxes will revert back to more normalized growth rates as we get into ‘24 and going forward. We think turnover will certainly go up over the next period of time. We get to a more normalized rate for us going forward. And then the cost return, which I just alluded to, should actually see some deflationary pressures over time because of the type of turns that we're going to be doing. And that should all put us back on a path that you saw from us for a very long time, where we had expense growth that was within inflation or a little bit less than inflation.
Operator: Thank you. We now have John Pawlowski of Green Street.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Maybe just continuing that line of thought. It just feels like you're baking in a lot of inflation on the expense line items and not a lot of inflation on rents, because some of these costs are going to push up the cost of ownership. So Charles, what markets on the ground are you seeing as potential canary in the coal mine for new lease growth going to, whatever, 3%, which seems to be implied in the guidance? Where are you seeing cracks in demand?
Charles Young: Yes. As we talked about earlier, occupancy is real-strong. Historically, looking at last year, Florida has been really strong for us, where we started to see when the seasonality came back was a bit of a slowdown in our traditional colder markets like the Denvers, the Chicagos. But in -- Minnesotas. But again, they're not material to us. And generally, we're still seeing good demand. And to Ernie's point, there's an opportunity or upside here on the new lease side, given kind of the structure of the portfolio today. Our occupancy is running really high for January historically, and we like the acceleration that we're seeing. So I don't see any markets that have concern. I see markets that have been really performing well. Phoenix slowed down. There was a lot of supply there for a short period, but we're seeing that bounce back quickly. So I'm not seeing anything that has us concerned. I think we're getting back to our historical rates. If you go back to pre-COVID, you're going to see seasonally the summer where there's turnover and high demand, we're going to see that's where new lease is going to push up. And I think it will be across the board. Some markets will perform a little better than others. And then you get into Q1 and Q4, and you get that seasonal slowdown where on the renewal side, we think it's going to be pretty steady. We're at a -- in the 8s in Q4, and we're holding steady here in January. We do think it's going to moderate a little bit as you get further out, given the loss to lease scenario laid out by Ernie. But I think the renewal side will be more steady, and we'll get the typical seasonality on the new lease side. That's great for us given our historical kind of footprint in our 60 markets. It's a nice balance.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Dennis McGill of Zelman. Your line is now open.
Dennis McGill: Thank you. Ernie, I was just hoping you can go back to that loss to lease comment. I think you said it was one to two. And last quarter, I think it was maybe 10, and there's a couple of factors there. You mentioned you're realizing some of it, and then some of it is just what's going on with seasonality or market rents. Just given that there's not as much turnover in the fourth quarter, I was wondering if you could maybe split out how much do you think of that is market versus what you've realized?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. And rough-rough, I think about -- when we looked at it, I'd say probably about a third of it, Dennis, was we were able to continue to earn into what's happening with leasing activity, but we did see a drop off of where market rate was in August, September of 2022 to where it ended up in December. We've certainly seen that already starting to work its way back up as we typically do in season, and Charles talked about our season starts a little bit sooner. But rough-rough was probably one-third, two-third, Dennis, in terms of what we were able to earn into versus where we saw some market declines from where they were in the stronger numbers in the third quarter.
Dennis McGill: And is that 1% to 2% number, is that end of the year or is that end of January?
Ernie Freedman: That would be December 31st.
Dennis McGill: Okay, thank you.
Ernie Freedman: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Anthony Powell of Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead when you are ready. Hello, Anthony could you please check your line is unmuted locally, we are not going any audio from the line. We'll move on to the next questioner. We now have Jade Rahmani of KBW.
Jade Rahmani: Thank you very much. Can you comment on what you're seeing in terms of new supply? Generally speaking, I think you made some comments about Phoenix having bounced back, but there's still pretty record levels of both multifamily supplies expected as well as build to rent with nearly every homebuilder allocating maybe 5% to 10% of their production towards single-family for rent. What are you expecting from new supply? And I know you're generally concentrated in infill locations, mainly having sourced properties from the existing home market. But your thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Thanks, Jade. And Charles can feel free to add anything to this. I think on the multifamily side, you're right, I think there's going to be some multifamily pressure in, kind, of a few different markets. But I think you've seen -- I think we -- even in our release, we talked about the differential on a per square foot basis in terms of how much more attractive SFR rents are likely than multifamily. The other thing I would just add is in just some of the data that we follow, we've actually seen kind of a pickup in new lease growth across call it the 99 SFR markets. It grew about -- according to Burns, it was like 6.5% in 2022. They're seeing a little bit -- most people are forecasting a little bit of a deceleration to Charles' point on the seasonality side. But look, I hope the takeaway here from the conversation and what Charles and Ernie have shared is we've been pleasantly surprised so far with the January numbers and where demand seems to be picking up. There were markets that had a little bit of pressure going into summer last year. But we are not seeing anything in our markets that's suggesting that a multifamily proposition is outweighing somebody's decision than to go at SFR. On the build-to-rent side of it, it's been really interesting to watch that market evolve, Jade. I toured a bunch of this last week in Phoenix. And some of this stuff is a little bit further out than what you would think of our portfolio if you spent some time in the car with us. And it's different. It comes in all shapes and sizes. Some of it is more of your kind of stack product or kind of share a common wall Gemini-type of kind of split floor plans where you have townhomes and a few other things. And then some of it is also the SFR detached piece. So I think the SFR detached piece, I worry less about from a value proposition perspective with townhome and amenities. We are paying attention to see if there's a value additive or a premium that is expected with those types of delivery. So far, we're not seeing anything that is directly impacting our business. And lastly, just as a reminder, we have built the portfolio from a purpose-built perspective going back 11 years ago to make sure that we made a much bigger focus on being infill and living amongst our neighbors and a lot of fee simple home ownership. That has carried the day for us, I think, both on a perspective of how we've been able to make sure that we are attracting some of the best rental rate in the marketplace but also the duration, length of stay. I've been most impressed lately with our -- some of this probably gets a little bit of a COVID tailwind to it. But our length of stay is now over almost three years in all our markets. California, we're seeing a push close to four years. People are just staying a lot longer, and I think it speaks to both the product, location, and I think the value proposition of a for-lease experience with a good business.
Operator: Thank you. We now have the next question from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead when you are ready.
Barry Lu: Hey, guys. It's Barry Lu on for Haendel St. Juste. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick question on the appeal process for George and Florida. Are you seeing any likelihood of success or material recoveries in those markets?
Ernie Freedman: Oh, there definitely is. There's likelihood they're having some success. We'll just have to see whether it will be material or not. The Georgia process can take a little -- both process can actually take a little bit of a while. As a reminder, we appealed more than we ever have in Georgia. Florida, we appealed similar to what we've done in past years and maybe a little bit more. Florida is a relatively fair regime when it comes to doing assessments. And so there's not going to -- we didn't put in a material number of appeals but may have a material success rate in terms of what happens in Florida. So I think the bigger opportunity for us and certainly, where we've appealed more especially based on where we saw assessments came out are going to be in Georgia, which is our third largest state. So we'll just have to wait and see in terms of how that plays out.
Operator: Thank you. We now have the next question from Michael Gorman of BTIG. Please go ahead, when you are ready, Michael.
Michael Gorman: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Ernie, could I just spend another minute on the bad debt side of the equation? I think you mentioned exposure to Southern California. Is that the only market that's driving the 75 -- 25 to 75 basis points or are there other geographies? And then how much of that is related to potential softening on the economic side versus regulatory pressures that's making it harder to deal with those tenants who do get behind on their rent?
Ernie Freedman: Yes, good question. The majority -- the vast majority of the increase is because of Southern California. We certainly have other markets and are performing where we want them to be and are higher where they've been historically. But we expect those markets to actually do about the same or improve from where they were in 2022, because we -- in most of the other markets, we're a little bit further along and be able to deal with things. So the majority of the concern is coming from Southern California, but it is sprinkled in some other places as well. And I'd say it's almost all, if not entirely due to the regulatory environment and working with the local courts, working with -- in some markets where pools to show the propensity to change. We're not seeing anything in today's numbers, anything in the last 12 months, not projecting anything forward that would tell us we need to do something different or more from a bad debt perspective with regards to just the overall environment and where things are at.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Linda Tsai: Hi, what kind of unemployment expectations do you assume for the base case of ‘23 guidance? Is it flat with today? Or are you forecasting deterioration?
Ernie Freedman: Yes, we're not -- we're -- I'll tell you, Linda, is we're assuming it's going to be an environment that's kind of similar what we've seen for the last 12 months. So we're not expecting a significant improvement. It would be hard improve where unemployment numbers are for where they are today that it's so low. We're also not forecasting at the midpoint of our guidance a degradation or a material degradation from where they are. And of course, then our guidance ranges do capture the fact that if we aren't able to push rate as much as we want or we have some occupancy challenges because of the labor market, that would get captured somewhat in our numbers with regards to the lower end of our range. But as Charles talked about, early days, but we're feeling pretty good with where occupancy is. And we're certainly seeing opportunity to do well on rate and maybe a little better than our guidance implies. But overall, we're kind of assuming it's going to be just kind of an overall similar type market, whether it's unemployment, whether -- and all the other macros that we're looking at right now.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Tony Paolone of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, when you are ready.
Tony Paolone: Thank you. You've talked in the past that you've built Invitation Homes to run materially more than the 83,000 homes you currently own. And so I'm just wondering, what are the -- what's the biggest gating factor to turn external growth back on in a more meaningful way? Like is it really your capital cost? Is it the selectivity of what you want to buy? Or do you just think prices are going to come down, and you don't want to be in front of that?
Dallas Tanner: It's not the latter. I mean, I think last year was more of the latter, Tony, in terms of -- we started to slow down our buying in April or May significantly because we were worried -- there's a lot of unknowns when the Fed started moving rate as fast as it did. Now I think we're all happy to say nine months later, we haven't seen a degradation in home prices that would suggest that there is huge doom and gloom on the horizon. It's really the opportunity set. Remember, we were able to build really significant scale over time in an environment where you had years of resale supply on the market and a cost of capital that was pretty attractive. In today's environment, we have less supply. We see kind of an uncertainty in how we even view kind of our own balance sheet capital right now. We're not pleased with where the stock is currently trading. And lastly, we see builders being a little more cautious, and there's local regulatory restriction. Now all that sounds negative. It's actually a really good thing for the demand side of our business, as you guys know. We are not seeing any degradation in top of funnel. In fact, to Ernie's point to what Charles said earlier, we're really bullish on the prospects of both the quality of the resident. We've seen a tremendous increase in, call it, the underwriting standards of our resident over the last couple of years and the amount of demand we have for the product. We obviously want to grow. We would love to grow. I think we've gotten pretty good marks of being a prudent capital allocator over time. And I think we got it right in large part by being in the markets that we are with the type of scale that we have. Tony, we're going to continue to find ways to build new product and to bring more product into the marketplace. We made that commitment about 18, 24 months ago. We've got over $1 billion, call it $1 billion, $1.5 billion in our current pipeline. And we're going to find ways to continue to build and create strategic ventures with partners that are on the homebuilding side so that we can start to ramp that up over the coming years. But we also want to continue to be opportunistic and buy in a one-off nature. The one thing that I think will be interesting and we're keeping an eye on is over the next couple of years, with interest rate costs being where they are, I think there are going to be some opportunities for additional M&A with small to midsized portfolios as operators consider their options around recapping or not. And I hope that we'll get an opportunity to look at some of those types of opportunities. And I would expect that in the sector, we'll still see opportunities for consolidation. Invitation Homes today is the combination of four or five different companies as it currently sits. And I would expect that there'll be opportunities to buy additional businesses or portfolios in the coming years. So expect us to kind of continue to keep an eye towards growth as we always have. But it's been a little bit of a weird year in terms of uncertainty and candidly just the limited amount of supply in the marketplace.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead, when you are ready, Austin.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes, thanks for taking the follow-up here. I don't believe this has been hit on, but just wanted to ask about the qui tam and sort of the latest update how you guys are thinking about a potential lengthy court proceedings, what the potential cost of that could be and whether or not you're considering or evaluating a potential settlement in order to be mindful, I guess, of the overall cost? Just any update there you can provide? Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Austin. This is Dallas. First, like, obviously, as we said before, we don't comment really in great detail on ongoing legal matters. In relationship to the qui tam, this will be likely a long process. We're not even to a discovery phase. It's still kind of at the front end of the administrative side. I'll say what we've said before. We feel like we have really good facts on our side. We will and reserve the right to defend ourselves appropriately. And we'll obviously update The Street and you guys as -- or if we had new information when it, come to us, but no update there at this point in time.
Operator: Thank you. We have the final question on the line from Anthony Powell of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Anthony Powell: Hi, hello? Can you hear me?
Dallas Tanner: We can hear you.
Ernie Freedman: We can.
Anthony Powell: Yes, thanks. Sorry for the earlier [Indiscernible]. I guess on turnover, mentioned a lot of times that turnover was increasing. I wanted to confirm that, that's really isolated to Southern California and other -- another bad debt situation. This is not really a general increase in turnover in your portfolio.
Ernie Freedman: No, no, it's across the board because we're still working through in all our markets, residents that haven't paying rent an issue in Southern Cal, there's certainly more there. So across the board, we're going to see an increase in turnover. And in fact, honestly, California may take a little longer for us to get there, because of the situation in the regulatory environment. So the bad debt number, and it's being elevated is going to be because of Southern California and because it's more difficult to move forward with residents who aren't paying there. But eventually, it's going to turn here with -- which hopefully continues to be with where the rules are. But it's going to be more across the board as we kind of clean up from the remainder of what was going on during the pandemic environment in most of our markets.
Anthony Powell: Got it. But it's not like due to tenants just not accepting rent increases and moving out, it's more of a bad debt tenants, can clean up. Is that fair?
Ernie Freedman: That is -- yes, absolutely. We're seeing our retention levels for people accepting and renewal increases being where they've always been. So it's just -- it's taking care of what you described.
Operator: Thank you. I would like to hand it back to Dallas Tanner for his closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: We thank everyone for joining us on the call today. And we look forward to seeing everybody at the Citi conference in a couple of weeks. Take care.
Operator: Thank you all for joining. That does conclude today's call. Please have a lovely day, and you may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-27 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Invitation Homes Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Scott McLaughlin Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Scott McLaughlin: Good morning and welcome. I'm here today from Invitation Homes with Dallas Tanner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer; and Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer. During this call we may reference our third quarter 2022 earnings release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after market closed and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com.  Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business financial results liquidity and capital resources and other nonhistorical statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements.  We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures in yesterday's earnings release.  With that let me turn the call over to Dallas.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks Scott and good morning. I appreciate everyone joining us today. It was a solid quarter for Invitation Homes with same-store NOI growth of 8.6% blended lease rate growth of 11.6% and average occupancy of 97.5%. Our continued low turnover high occupancy and high resident satisfaction scores remain a testament to the outstanding efforts of our associates. My thanks to them for providing another quarter of premier resident service especially those recently impacted by Hurricane Ian.  I couldn't be prouder of the quick and caring response our team members provided in the wake of the storm as well as our role in helping the communities we serve. Across the country we provide housing choice and flexibility that residents desire and need, while the macro world we all live in has changed quite a bit in the past year we believe our business remains well positioned to succeed within it. Here's why.  To start we believe professionally managed single-family homes for lease are an important part of the housing solution in the United States. We still face a housing supply shortage in this country by as many as several million units from some accounts. Today's elevated interest and mortgage rates haven't helped as seen by the pullback from builders in the last month's further decline in starts for single-family home. It's also harder for those thinking of buying a home in the near term. Recent reports have noted that monthly payments on new mortgages have increased by as much as 60% since the start of this year due to higher mortgage rates.  According to last month's data from John Burns, this contributes to a cost of homeownership that is over 20% higher on average than leasing across Invitation Homes markets. That works out to an average difference of roughly $600 a month in savings from leasing a home. So, leasing remains a preferred choice for many families combining convenience and flexibility as well as value. These advantages further fan the favorable tailwinds of demographics especially among millennials who are just beginning to approach our average resident age of 39 years old. With our expectation that these favorable supply and demand dynamics will stay with us there's a call to grow our industry-leading scale technology and experience. We consider this in tandem with our cost of capital. Our updated acquisition assumption for the full year is $1.1 billion and through the third quarter we've acquired approximately $1 billion of that target.  We have slowed our acquisition pace in light of the current environment, taking advantage of opportunities to recycle assets and weighing our cost of capital on balance sheet versus our joint ventures. As a result, we're continuing to explore all opportunities available to us to expand our investment management businesses and explore accretive growth, while at the same time operating as prudent capital allocators who remain nimble for when opportunities may arise.  As we have continued to learn and grow so have many of our best practices, including how we address energy and sustainability. We recently deepened our bench with the hiring of two in-house experts to oversee our ESG and our energy initiatives. We have a responsibility and a commitment to be a leader in these areas among our industry, and I'm pleased to see us making good progress. Of particular note, we recently learned that our latest GRESB score increased over 13% year-over-year, a significant improvement reflects the great work by our ESG task force. Before wrapping up, I'd like to comment on our reported results and our updated guidance. Our revised full year guidance for 2022, is consistent with our prior expectations for the overall business with two exceptions: property taxes and bad debt. Property tax assessments have been impacted more quickly, than we would have anticipated due to the robust home price appreciation within our markets. And our bad debt is expected to stay somewhat elevated compared to before the pandemic, as it's taking us longer to address residents who are not current with the rents. We're committed to doing our best, to help manage through these items. In closing, we believe our business remains favorably positioned, within the residential and the broader REIT space. And we're excited by the positive impact we're making, for greater options in housing and the opportunities we believe this brings to Invitation Homes and our stakeholders.  With that, I'll pass it on to Charles, our Chief Operating Officer.
Charles Young: Thank you, Dallas. I'd like to begin by thanking all of our teams for their commitment to providing outstanding customer service and earning the loyalty of our residents every day. I'm especially, proud of our associates in Florida and the Carolinas for their hard work and genuine care following Hurricane Ian. We're thankful to have avoided any reported injuries from the storm. Now, let's discuss the details of our third quarter operating results. Our same-store net operating income grew 8.6% year-over-year. Same-store core revenue growth was 8.3%, primarily driven by a 9.6% increase in average monthly rent, and a 15.5% increase in other income. Our same-store average occupancy was 97.5% for the third quarter. The sequential decrease from the second quarter reflects our expected return to a more normal seasonality patterns that have otherwise been absent the past two years. We also saw a return of elevated bad debt in the third quarter to 170 basis points. The quarterly rate has fluctuated this year, from as high as 190 basis points to as low as 70 basis points. Rental system payments have been a factor in the volatility, and we are seeing that many of these programs are starting to wind down. We've been proud of our role in working with residents who need help, and we'll continue to seek solutions to common ground. Overall, our portfolio remains very healthy. New resident average household incomes continue to improve climbing to over $134,000 per year, representing an average income-to-rent ratio of 5.3 times. Returning to our same-store results for the quarter. Core operating expenses increased 7.6% year-over-year, primarily driven by a 3.8% increase in fixed expenses, a 15.4% increase in repair and maintenance expense and a 15.2% increase in turnover expenses. These increases were attributable to the continued inflationary pressure -- pressures and a rise in the number of move-outs of residents, who are not current with their rent. Our teams are working hard to leverage our procurement relationships, our scale and our technology to combat these pressures where we can. Next, I'll cover third quarter leasing trends. New lease rates grew 15.6% and renewal rates grew 10.2%. This resulted in blended rent growth of 11.6% or 100 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2021. Given that we're nearing the end of the year, I'll also touch on how things are shaping up for October. We expect new lease rate growth for this month to come in at 9% or better, and renewal increases to come in at 10% or better. We sent out renewals for November and December in the mid-10% range. All told, these are strong increases that we believe underscore the current health of the single-family fundamentals. Looking ahead, we remain focused on ways we can better utilize technology to lower cost and improve resident experience. One example of how we've done this is, with our mobile maintenance app. We launched the app a bit over a year ago, and it's now been downloaded over 110,000 times with an average app score rating in the high 4s. Our residents are submitting about 40% of total work orders, through the app today. These submissions include a high rate of photos and videos, reducing the need for return trips and making the experience a lot more convenient for our residents. Since the launch of the mobile app, we have also reduced a proportion of our overall maintenance requests that are received by our call center, by nearly one-third. Once again, I'm proud of our teams, who rose to the challenges of a hurricane, high bar prior year comps and significant inflation to deliver a solid result for the third quarter. We remain laser-focused on executing and planning to finish the year strong. I'll now turn the call over to Ernie, our Chief Financial Officer.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today, I will discuss the following topics: first, our balance sheet; second, our financial results for the third quarter; and third, our revised 2022 guidance. I'll begin with my first topic our balance sheet. We believe our solid investment-grade rated balance sheet positions us well as we navigate the current environment. To recap, 99% of our debt is fixed or swapped to fixed, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.6%, with approximately two-thirds of our debt being unsecured. We've also made significant progress in laddering our debt maturities with no debt due until 2025. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is now 5.7 times solidly within our target range of 5.5 to six times. As of the end of the third quarter, our liquidity totaled nearly $1.9 billion through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility and term loan. Turning now to my second topic, our third quarter financial results. Core FFO increased 9.5% year-over-year to $0.42 per share, primarily due to an increase in NOI, driven by strong rent growth and demand for our homes. This drove an 8.2% year-over-year increase in AFFO to $0.34 per share. I'd like to point out, the following two non-recurring items included in our third quarter reconciliation of reported FFO to core FFO. The first is our estimated financial impact of Hurricane Ian. Our third quarter net casualty losses in our core FFO reconciliation include a $19 million accrual for estimated losses and damages related to the storm. Based on our prior experience, it's possible that additional damage maybe identified over the coming months, and if needed, we will adjust our estimates. Additionally, a small portion of the losses maybe recoverable through our insurance policies that provide coverage for wind, flood and business interruption, subject to deductibles and limits. The second non-recurring item is an approximate $7.5 million global settlement of a multistate alleged class action regarding resident late fees. The settlement covers claims initially asserted in May of 2018 and involved allegations similar to what others in the residential sector have faced or are still facing. While we strongly believe that the allegations were without merit and we do not admit to any liability in the settlement, we believe it was in the best interest of the business to settle the case in order to save time and expense associated with the litigation. Settlement remains subject to court approval. The last thing I will cover is our updated guidance for the full year. Included in last night's release are the details of these updates, which reflect our revised expectations for same-store results and core FFO and AFFO per share. As Dallas mentioned, the majority of the change in our updated same-store core operating expense guidance is due to our revised expectations for real estate taxes. Home price depreciation has been very strong in our markets for much of 2021 and 2022. Historically, we have seen that local assessors might take longer to reflect current fair values in their assessments and that millage rate resets might be impactful to partially offset increasing assessments. Although, we have not yet received all final tax bills, based on the information available to us, we believe our growth in real estate taxes will now be 7% to 8% for 2022 or about 300 basis points higher than previous expectations. This increase is primarily due to significantly higher assessments and anticipated tax bills for our homes in Florida and Georgia, partially offset by favorable expectations in other jurisdictions. Assessments in Florida and Georgia were up on average almost 30% from prior year. We plan to appeal a much higher proportion of these assessments compared to prior years, knowing that there will be a timing difference between when we appeal and when any rebates are received. Less impactful is the change in our outlook for same-store core revenue growth. We reduced our expectations as we now expect bad debt to remain somewhat elevated relative to pre-pandemic historical norms as it continues to take longer to address residents, who are not current with their rent. In conclusion, it's clearly been a dynamic year-to-date, marked with favorable supply-and-demand fundamentals and overall strong performance from our associates and business. We believe our seasoned team and time-tested platform are well prepared to continue to execute and deliver solid results. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Can you discuss the supply growth or shrinkage in SFR homes available for sale? So what is the number of homes you were tracking on the MLS or Zillow? And I'm looking for supply growth of single-family listings and more importantly the measure of change in that metric over the past few months.
Dallas Tanner: Hi, Derek, this is Dallas. It's a good question. And I think it's something that, obviously, we've spent quite a bit of time looking at over the years and paying even maybe more attention to, in light of recent volatility around mortgage rates and some of the home price appreciation metrics that are out there. Today, I would say, it's so far kind of acting and behaving for the most part in our markets fairly cyclical, obviously, being impacted by the fact that mortgage rates are kind of -- have taken off to new highs. We're not seeing anything that suggests wholesale change as of yet. In fact, we had some people in our offices this week who are a bit more experts on the matter and we spent some time looking at resale supply across, call it, Invitation Homes markets. And funny enough it's pretty early, we're actually seeing a drop in new listings that you would typically see at this time of the year. And it sort of makes sense, as you start to think about where mortgage debt in the country is. Vast majority of the country has mortgage rates in place today that are quite favorable relative to where you could currently go out and price. So, as much as, I think, the near-term headlines had been that maybe we'd start to see some opportunities in terms of additional supply to be able to buy on the resale side, that just hasn't been the case thus far. So far it feels like, months of supply are doing kind of their normal cyclical creep a little bit late in the year. But when you start to really dive down and look at less than 60 days on the market, that's when you're seeing actual new listings decline in the majority of Invitation Homes markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nicholas Joseph from Citi. Please, go ahead.
Nicholas Joseph: Thank you. Maybe just on external growth, it seems like you're pulling back on acquisitions, at least, currently. And I recognize, kind of, the business was born out of a dislocation in the housing market. And so, what are you looking for in terms of reentering, or what kind of dislocation would you need to see to go in large scale on acquisition mode? And then, as you think about funding that, how do you think about JVs versus increasing leverage from here?
Dallas Tanner: Hi, Nick, this is Dallas. Great question. I think -- and going back to our call that we had in May, we talked about the fact that we had started to pull back on our acquisitions in terms of kind of level setting and we wanted to get a view on what the market was going to feel like towards the back part of this year. That being said, we've seen a little bit of softening, what I would say, in kind of normalized cap rates. Today it feels like, call it, the kind of product and in the parts of the markets where we typically invest capital, those prices feel kind of in the mid-5s to kind of the, call it, 5.25 in terms of where current pricing is today. We would like to probably be measured in our approach and just making sure that we feel like -- we're not trying to call a bottom, but I think we'd want to average in over time if there are new valuations that could give us on a risk-adjusted basis a much better return profile. As we think about how we're going to grow the portfolio over time, we obviously have the use of JVs. We have the liquidity that Ernie talked about in our opening remarks. And then, obviously, we've talked over the last couple of years about the need to expand our investment management businesses, because we look at that as extremely accretive growth when, at times, maybe the REIT's cost of capital isn't as good as we'd hope it would be. And certainly, right now, we're not thrilled about where the equity prices are today. So with that being said, I think, we'll continue to use our partnerships and JVs. We'll find ways to meaningfully invest. We generate a really good amount of, what I would call, outperformance through our fee structures and our management business around those joint ventures. And we've got partners who have been extremely reliable and that are also, I think, looking at the potential environment as you mentioned, Nick, as being quite appealing. So we actually are being measured, I'd say, in the near term but cautiously, I think, preparing for ourselves for maybe some good opportunities to continue to expand, our external growth opportunities in relation to what the market allows for going forward.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jeff Spector: Good morning. If it's okay, just two parts on the real estate taxes and assessments. I know you guys provided an update in September. I guess, first, if you can just describe the process. Ernie you said that, based on information available today that clearly the market is surprised by this update. When did this come to light? And then second, …
Ernie Freedman: Yeah.
Jeff Spector: …I guess, can you just talk about the normal appeal process or historically in Florida, Georgia the likelihood or success you've seen in the past, just to give us a feel for what may happen in the coming months? Thank you.
Ernie Freedman: Yeah. Sure Jeff. So with regards to real estate taxes there's, really two key components to the real estate tax bill: one is the assessment and one is millage rates. We do start to see preliminary views on assessments during the third quarter in both Florida and Georgia. The challenge is we don't see millage rate information until in some cases -- actually in most cases the earliest is mid-October. And in some cases Jeff we still haven't seen the final numbers on millage rates at this point. We won't see those to the tax bills that come out here in the next few weeks. So the challenge is in the past we've seen assessments in millage rates do some different things in terms of when assessments go up often millage rates will come down. But we don't have the full picture and the full understanding of that until we get towards the end of October. So that's why as we are out and engaging with folks in August and September we do not have clarity as to where the real estate tax bills may be going. And we want to make sure we had full information before making a final judgment on what that would be. And hence that's why we had the adjustment that we had here as we think about our fourth quarter numbers. You'll see in our numbers that they're not even reflected in the third quarter, because we didn't have all the information in our third quarter numbers, but we do have that today. With regards to appeals it really varies jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction, Jeff. It can be as quick as three to six months in some cases. In other cases it can take as many as nine to 18 months. And so we really won't have a good sense for our success rate on appeals until we're well into 2023. Most of them will have an opportunity to get a sense for where it's heading in 2023. And there will be a small handful that may take into early 2024 to have final results on the appeals. We're optimistic that we're seeing assessments as high as they went that we'll have better opportunity we've had in the past to fight. And we're certainly going to do that. We're going to appeal more than we ever have in the past especially in those two states. And we'll just have to see how that plays out.
Operator: Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hi guys. Good morning out there. So you delivered very solid operating results in the third quarter and better stability in rents than we've seen in multifamily. But obviously cutting guidance late in here was a bit of a surprise. So I was hoping you could help us under understand a bit more what's going on at least with the same-store revenue reduction. You mentioned a few times that bad debt is taking longer to get resolved. So I'm curious, why is it taking so much longer? And is that mostly focused in a particular region perhaps California? And do you think bad debt overall can become a tailwind into next year? Thanks.
Charles Young: Hi Haendel, it’s Charles. Thanks for the question. Let me just step back and kind of set context around the environment. As we talked about on prior calls since early in the pandemic we were very conscious of working with residents that face the closer hardship and helped thousands of residents with flexible payment plans and the like. But in 2022, we purposely were focused in on getting back to our typical enforcement of the lease where we legally could. But what we're seeing in the process -- and it has been working is -- what we're seeing in the process though however is the states are taking -- and it varies by state they're taking two or three times longer to process non-payers through the system. And to your question, California, Southern California specifically is the most difficult area; the NorCal, Illinois, Georgia. That being said, at the same time, rental assistance has been a big part of what we've done to help our -- support our residents. And today we've supported over 12,000 residents secure rental assistance. And in 2022 alone, we've secured over $57 million to help them. And we knew that that rental assistance would slow down towards the back half of the year, but that acceleration in Q3 was a little faster than we thought it would be. The good news is, as that acceleration has come we have gotten better at being able to collect rent on normal non-rental assistance and that our residents are also seeing that. And we're starting to see them step up in terms of recognizing that kind of perverse incentive that they were waiting on the rental systems to show up that they need to pay now. So it is kind of across the board with the rental assistance but we saw the biggest slowdown in the California markets as well and that's where the biggest delay is. And we've talked about this before L.A. County and L.A. City are some of the more kind of slower to move off of the -- being able to go through the normal legal process. So we're moving through it and it's just going to be a little bit of a transition as we work through it over the next few quarters.
Operator: Our next question is from Brad Heffern at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ernie a follow-up on the property taxes. So typically when you have one elevated expense quarter you get three more of them as it sort of flows through. Obviously, you're not giving 2023 guidance. But I'm curious should we expect to see some, sort of, teens operating expense growth in the first few quarters of 2023 as this increased property tax level flows through?
Ernie Freedman: No. Actually Brad I'm glad you're asking that so we can clarify it. It's going to be the opposite. We have to do a catch-up because we didn't accrue enough in the first three quarters of 2022. So we're going to have a very elevated growth rate for real estate taxes in the fourth quarter here because we upped the increase, but it's because we were under accrued in hindsight without having all the information available to us. So you're going to see a very elevated growth here in the fourth quarter. But then as we think about our year-over-year comps you'll see some -- because we've had a reset at a higher level you'll see it slightly elevated in the first part of the year. And then the fourth quarter, of course, would be an easier comp as things played out the same. But it shouldn't be at the same level that you're seeing here in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Hi. Just going back to an earlier question with regards to some of the for-sale product coming back to the market. What's going on with that? Is that being moved to for rental? And is there maybe kind of a shadow supply in the single-try rental space that's impacting, whether it's occupancy or churn or rate that you could speak to across your portfolio and anything different geography-wise?
Dallas Tanner: Juan no. Actually I'd sort of say the opposite. All things being equal I think if you look at our blended rate growth this quarter at roughly I think 11.6% we went back and looked at called pre-pandemic numbers from the third quarter of 2019 we're at like 4.5%. So we're still seeing call it accelerated demand and appreciating that in between the balance of home price appreciation and the amount of demand for product. Our occupancy still elevated in the mid kind of 97s. And so as you think about that on a kind of historical basis over the last 10 or 11 years that we run the business we're actually seeing more demand for this time of the year than we would typically see in a normal year. So I wouldn't say so. Now certainly there are other operators out there that are -- that probably have and are digesting new product as it comes to the marketplace. And some of your Sun Belt markets you might see maybe a little bit of additional more supply. But we're not seeing anything in our numbers and Charles to speak to this as well that would suggest that we're having any change in top of funnel or our ability to execute on leases. Now all things being equal this tends to be in a normal year the slower part of the year from a leasing perspective. So it is good to keep that perspective that as you get into the last quarter of the year and kind of early call it January that is where we have generally always have had our lowest leasing velocity outside of the two what I would call the 2021 pandemic year. So that -- those last two kind of fall months into the winter have not behaved as normal as what we are seeing probably a little bit more so this year. So we're not seeing any of the supply front at the end of the day that's causing us really any concern. It's just more about how can we execute the business fight the inflationary cost pressures and continue to kind of maximize efficiencies within our platform.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Kramer at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Adam Kramer: Hi, guys. Appreciate it. Just want to ask about bad debt. Look recognize that there may have been some kind of rental assistance impacts in the quarter, but clearly kind of less than prior quarters. So just wondering if you can kind of quantify the rental systems received in the quarter. And then relative to kind of the 170 bps of bad debt in the quarter recognizing kind of pre-COVID normal was maybe 30 bps to 40 bps what's kind of the process from getting from here to there? How long could that take? And is there a chance that we kind of just structurally or maybe due to regulatory changes that maybe we never kind of get back to that kind of pre-COVID basis points 30 to 40 basis points?
Ernie Freedman: Let me walk through the first part of the question Adam with regards to the impact of rental assistance, and how that's dropped off a little bit here from the second quarter to third quarter. I'll turn it over to Charles, about how we think where we go next with bad debt. So from the second quarter to the third quarter, we saw rent assistance payments drop for us by $9 million from $23 million to $14 million. Bad debt went up $5 million from the second quarter to third quarter. So, one might have thought that if we're going to lose $9 million of rent assistance, bad debt would have been up $9 million. It's only up $5 million, and that's because of what Charles talked about.  People are getting -- they understand that rent assistance, isn't going to be available for them anymore. And people are starting to get back on I'd say, what we saw pre-pandemic in terms of keeping more current with their rents. So we would expect going forward maybe a similar type thing, where you see rent assistance continue to drop off and fade away and likely be gone as we -- it may be a little bit trickles into the first quarter of 2023, but we're not counting on very much there at all. But for the last couple of quarters, we've seen better behavior in terms of people then making up for the fact, that we've had a little bit of a dropoff there.
Charles Young: Yes. As I said on earlier question, the flexibility that we were showing while we're waiting and supporting the residents, with rental assistance and how we've been tightening this year, we're just going to continue to do that as residents recognize that the rental assistance going away. The partial payments and all that stuff, we're going really back to where we were before. And as Ernie just mentioned, we've seen improvement in terms of how residents are paying. A lot of it is just the psychology effect of them getting back to understanding we are at our normal way in which we enforce the lease. And we'll continue to do that to execute while the rental assistance, wanes and we're starting to see good improvement and we'll continue to push. And it will be like I said, a little bit of a transition period as we work through back to normal eventually.
Operator: The next question is from Keegan Carl at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. 
Keegan Carl: Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Maybe, just wanted to clarify some things. Just kind of curious what percentage of your leases are month-to-month rather than annual? And how does this compare to pre-pandemic levels?
Charles Young: Yes. So on the month-to-month side, we're at about 6% to 8% 
A – Ernie Freedman: Yes.
Charles Young: California is really where we see the majority of the month-to-month leases. Other than that, we haven't really seen any change to the number. The California numbers are increasing just because of the CPI plus 5% that are happening on the renewals. And the numbers are close to each other in terms of doing a renewal or a new lease. And sometimes, they just choose to go month-to-month. We're not seeing any change in terms of, retention or renewal rates. It's just around the month-to-month itself.
Operator: Our next question is from Chandni Luthra from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Chandni Luthra: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So you guys laid out taxes for next year, but how should we think about other line items within expenses going into 2023, so repair and maintenance utilities, insurance all of those line items, please?
A – Ernie Freedman: Yes. Chandni, this is Ernie. To be clear, with real estate taxes the question was pretty specific around just what's happened with the fourth quarter here and what things may look like on a year-over-year comp basis. I want to make very clear, we didn't provide any guidance for what we thought 2020, the overall real estate taxes would be. And Chandni, we're not providing guidance at this time for any 2023 items. So unfortunately, we're not the decline to answer that.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Spahn from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. 
Brian Spahn: Hi, Thanks. I might have missed this but could you talk about, where the loss of lease is today at the portfolio and just your expectations in capturing that today? And then also, what the earn-in looks like for next year just given the activity year-to-date?
A – Ernie Freedman: Yes. Loss of lease right now is tracking to be right around 10%, where we currently stand in terms of where market rents are. And if you were to just look at where we think rents end out through the remainder of the year, and where the year is at this point relative to what our average rents were for the year, our earn-in is it will be almost right at 4%, just a hair under 4% in terms of just from a rate perspective. Of course, we'll have to take in consideration what we think is going to have with occupancy rates next year, as well as bad debt to get to a fuller picture for rental growth or revenue growth, excuse me.
Operator: Our next question is from Neil Malkin from Capital One. Please go ahead. 
Neil Malkin: Thanks. Good morning. A question on the homebuilding side. I guess, you could say it's a two-parter. First, just given the reduction in mortgage applications and homebuilder sentiment, are you seeing -- are you getting more inbound calls, and what kind of momentum or capital allocation priorities? Are you kind of dedicating toward buying more of those assets homes through the homebuilder relationships? And then secondly, what's your thought about potentially buying a regional homebuilder just to kind of give yourself an embedded growth pipeline when the acquisition market isn't advantageous?
Dallas Tanner: Hi. This is Dallas. Yes, we definitely would want to stay opportunistic with any opportunities that come to us vis-à-vis homebuilders. There's certainly a lot of chatter out there. I think right now, it's sort of the early stages of what are homebuilders thinking with their future pipelines and call it, active inventory and things like that. It's safe to say, we've gotten a lot of phone calls and I'm assuming a lot of our peers are getting the same phone calls. I think it doesn't really change our strategy in terms of having a large desire to continue to stay infill buy opportunities that seem extremely accretive over the long-haul and put structures in place that will protect us, call from further downside risk that could happen in the marketplace. So, I still feel like it's pretty early in terms of kind of where some of this is shaking out. I think builders have done a nice job of trying to move some of their call it current sitting inventory. They've also got some tools in their tool belt from what I'm hearing on the kind of just conversations around buying down mortgage rates and things like that. So, I imagine a lot of the near-term inventory can get taken care of through kind of the use of buying down rate. Also, obviously, selling scattered sites to operators, like ourselves, we have done some of that. I think over the last couple of years, we've picked up a couple of hundred homes that way. So, we're going to continue to invest in it. It's part of our thesis. We have over 2000 homes in our pipeline that we're doing with Pulte and other partners. And we would view this as a very opportunistic moment for us say over the next year or two where we should be able to lean in and be a good partner with not only our current partners but maybe future partners down the road. So, from our advantage point, we've seen this once before. While my current belief is that we're not going to see housing move backwards like we did in 2007 and 2008. I think it could be a great opportunity for Invitation Homes over time to make additional meaningful investments that will add to our already, what I would call industry-leading scale and performance. So, we're viewing the next, call it, a couple of years as a great opportunity for growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please go ahead.
Jason Sabshon: Hi. This is actually Jason Sabshon, speaking on behalf of Jade. But there's a lot of chatter about multifamily demand slowing driven by a slowdown in housing formation. Do you view single-family rental as a substitute product for multi? And do you expect the sector to behave similarly?
Dallas Tanner: The short answer is, we would expect SFR to be pretty resilient in a downcycle. I think we exhibited that quite frankly over the last 2.5 years during the pandemic. We had tremendous performance in 2021. In addition to that, a couple of things you got to keep in mind. One, the customer isn't exactly the same customer. While our businesses operate very similarly, if you look at them from a P&L or a balance sheet perspective, customers are typically different. The other advantage of single-family typically has is that on a rent per square foot basis it's much more efficient with a single-family for-rent product. And then lastly, I would also add that in an opportunity where square footage may matter or people are looking at how can I have kind of call it, investing greatest use of my dollars, SFR is going to provide a better bang for your buck. So, we would expect our business to hold up pretty well given any of the downcycle some of the embedded loss at least that Ernie talked about and the overall limitations around supply. You have to take a step back in these moments and also remember, on a fundamental basis, we don't have enough housing units in this country. Specifically, if you look at our portfolio and where we're lined up, you still are going to have household formation and demographic growth that's almost 2.5 times the US average. So we would expect a lot of near and medium-term demand for our product. And then, we talked about it earlier in our call that millennial cohort of 65 million people between say the ages of 25 and 38, are just coming into our business right now. So, we're actually quite bullish in terms of, what I would call natural tailwinds that should feed into the SFR value proposition.
Operator: Our next question is from Adam Hamilton at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Adam Hamilton: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for your time. I really appreciate all the color around the bad debt the tailwinds and what you just spoke about in terms of the housing tailwinds. So I was wondering if you could provide, maybe, some specifics around the geographical concentration of some of that bad debt and whether or not you guys are seeing any price sensitivity associated with that going forward. Thanks.
Charles Young: Yes. This is Charles. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned, geographically, California, Southern California specifically is where we're seeing both the kind of slowdown in the rental assistance, as well as the slowdown in the court systems, where historically it might have been 60, 90 days; it's taking 180 to over 200 days. That's in Southern California. NorCal, it's 120 to 180 days. The other markets that we're seeing a little bit of a change -- again, this isn't necessarily behavior of the residents, but it's around the process to move non-payers through are in Georgia, where it used to be 90 days its 150 days-plus. And Vegas is -- surprisingly used to be very quick it's 150 days. So -- and then when we have L.A. County and L.A. City where you're still -- we're not even able to file. That's going to show up next year as we work through some of this. So there's going to be a little bit of a tail in the California markets as we deal with this. But all the markets again, as we work through the legal enforcement, we're getting there and the residents are responding as they're seeing the rental assistance go away and slow down. I'll just step back on one question that Keegan asked earlier around month-to-month. I overstated the number. We're about 3.5% month-to-month. So I just want to make sure we got the number precise.
Operator: Our next question is from Dennis McGill at Zelman & Associates. Please, go ahead.
Dennis McGill: Hi. Good morning. Thanks, guys. Ernie could you just maybe walk through a little bit more beyond property taxes? If we look at the full year guidance for expense growth back into something for fourth quarter, it seems like other categories as well would have to show some notable acceleration from where you were in the third quarter, which were already pretty elevated, unless I'm doing something wrong.
Ernie Freedman: Yes. No, Dennis, we continue to have inflationary pressures on both the -- with regards to repairs and maintenance and on terms. With churn, I would call out, we also do expect turnover to be maybe slightly higher than at last year. But the bigger issue with the turnover is, as we are having some success as Charles talked about in dealing with residents who aren't paying rent, those churns tend to be more expensive when someone comes out. So you got the cost pressures as well our average cost per churn is going up a little bit more as well because of that. But you're absolutely right. It's been a challenging year for us across the board. When you take a look at what we think what's going to happen with real estate taxes, we continue to expect to see continued pressures on repairs and maintenance as well as churn. And those are the categories that are really driving, based on what our guidance is you're trying to interpolate what fourth quarter looks like, certainly the highest number we've seen all year, mainly driven by real estate taxes, but also because of some of the other issues.
Operator: Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc. Please, go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Can you guys just remind us how you calculate loss to lease and how changes in home prices impact that calculation? I believe you said the loss to lease is 10%. And then, Dallas, I think earlier on the call you referenced a 20% average difference between the cost to own versus rent in your market. So can you just talk about the interplay of those various variables?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. I would tell you, Austin, they don't really relate necessarily directly from a pricing perspective. The cost to rent and the value you get from renting relative to what it cost -- the price of home isn't how the pricing mechanism works for us with regards to how do we price our leases. We're pricing our leases based on what the market will bear. And sometimes the market bears more sometimes the market bears less. Specific then to how do we calculate our loss to lease and which is today is about 10%, is each month we price anywhere between 5% to 10% of our portfolio, because of what's coming due from a renewal and new lease perspective. It's a pretty good proxy of what we think the entire -- with the entire portfolio price, you understand we have a very homogeneous product and each house is very different. We don't go each month and say 80,000 homes in our portfolio repriced. We use that as a proxy to where market rents are and we're running that through our revenue management system. And then, we take that and on a weighted average basis then put that across our entire portfolio to calculate what we think estimated market rent is today. And again, it's not going to tie into an affordability metric for buying a house versus necessarily renting it -- renting in our markets. They're really two distinct things, but that's how we come up with our loss to lease.
Operator: Our next question is from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please, go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi. To the extent there's concern over the economy slowing, do you have a sense of how your rents compare to the market rents of single-family homes across your different markets?
Ernie Freedman: We price to market. So I think we have -- in general across the very broad rental space we're at a little bit of a higher end relative to other rentals that are out there and that's pretty consistent market to market. But in terms of where the types of homes we have the size of the homes we have in terms of where they're in we're generally -- we think we're very much at the market for those. We try to do it a little bit better because we're professionally managed.  But we think we're kind of in that same space. And I think importantly when you look at our affordability metrics coming in at almost $134000 for average income 5.3 income-to-rent ratios. Where I think most rental companies across the board their minimum requirements are 3:1, we feel like we're in a pretty good spot especially we're also having on average two wage earners in each of our homes.
Operator: Our next question is from Alan Peterson at Green Street. Please go ahead. 
Alan Peterson: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the time. Charles, we noticed on your website that you're now offering concessions in select markets. Just a question on concession usage. Is this meant to build up occupancy from here, or is the decision to use concessions based on the view that occupancy could continue to decline if you weren't to use them?
Charles Young: Yes. No great question. Look we -- 97.5% ended Q3 really strong. We know that it's Q4 as Dallas mentioned that we're seeing the seasonality return to the market that wasn't there the last couple of years. And so, this is typical as we go into Q4 and it's a push for the holidays. So the -- we're running limited concessions on select homes as really a push before Thanksgiving just to secure and make sure that we keep occupancy at a healthy rate which it is or 97%-plus for this time of the year is amazing.  We're seeing good demand and healthy rent growth with the numbers that I gave you. Blended rent growth with the strength of renewals are really strong. So this is really just making sure we go into the slow period highly occupied as high as we can and then set us up well for 2023.
Operator: Our next question is from Anthony Powell from Barclays. Please go ahead. 
Anthony Powell: Hi. A quick question on the bad debt. I wanted to confirm that it was all due to I guess COVID-era tenants who weren't paying versus newly delinquent tenants that may be finding some current issues given the economy?
Charles Young: The growing kind of bad debt number is the historical those that are COVID that are working through the courts. If there is somebody who's new we're -- again we're going through our enforcement of the lease. And that process isn't creating a lot of new. But again, you end up with the courts that are slower. So there's a little bit of a mixed bag in there. But the big numbers are really based on the historical a lot of the California -- Southern California residents as we've talked about.
Operator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Juan Sanabria: Hi. I just wanted to follow up on the Pulte relationship and the relationship with other homebuilders where you're taking out a product upon completion. Is the pricing on that preset once you give them the go ahead to build or how should we think about the mechanics of kind of changing the takeout price given the higher debt cost and cost of capital in today's environment?
Dallas Tanner: Well, the structure is pretty easy to follow. We basically -- any time we look at a project we decide on basically a given range of where we think we could execute on pricing with them. And then we have callers to kind of protect them and us generally speaking on both sides so that if they have cost creep then there's another discussion beyond a certain limit and we have the ability more or less to walk away.  If there are savings meaning costs come down or there's some market changes there, we have another discussion. So by and large we're pretty well protected with pretty limited what I would call earnest money upfront. And a lot of these projects tend to be inflight with updates along the way. So general structures have callers to protect both Pulte and us. And then we have -- we take those deliveries in different tranches over call it longer periods of time, so that we can have market dynamics come into that as well.  So all I think generally I could say very favorable from a structure perspective. And obviously as we go forward as we look at new opportunities, we're also going to spend more time looking at just call it price volatility and how it could relate to the overall markets over the next year or two. So everybody's going to be eyes wide open on new opportunities to make sure that not only are we locking in great assets, good locations but that we'll be at pricing that is either favorable to call it current market, the conditions or future. So Juan I hope that answered your question.
Operator: Our final question comes from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please go ahead.
Jade Rahmani: Hi. I just wanted to follow-up quickly. So is the shortfall in home purchase demand directly benefiting single-family rental new lease demand, or is the impact not material at this point? In other words, are you seeing notable percentage of applications from people who otherwise would be looking to buy a home?
Dallas Tanner: No. Our top of funnel has felt pretty consistent in terms of call it the type of customer coming into our business today. And it lines up with things that we generally would see in normal years around this time of the year. Now that being said and I think it's important to emphasize, we're not seeing anything that's suggesting wholesale changes in the housing market right now outside of maybe new listings coming into the space and decelerating, which should support home prices in the near-term. That being said I think we're also early in where the impact of mortgage rates are and what that could mean for our business both in how we capture existing demand in the marketplace, because one could obviously argue if the cost of owning a home is 60% higher today than it was in January of earlier this year that's a net windfall to single-family rental one would assume. We're not seeing anything on the supply side that's suggesting that we're going to have a tremendous amount of inbound to put pressure on our existing supply. So we view the overall landscape as quite favorable, but we're also being realistic that it's still pretty early in terms of where mortgage rates are providing impact. But we'll obviously keep everybody updated on our thoughts as we go forward.
End of Q&A:
Operator: This concludes the Q&A session. I will hand the call back to Dallas.
Dallas Tanner: We appreciate everyone's participation today. We look forward to seeing everyone at upcoming conferences. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you all for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-28 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Invitation Homes Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Irene and I will be coordinating this event. I would like to turn the conference over to our host Scott McLaughlin, Head of Investor Relations. Scott, please go ahead.
Scott McLaughlin: Thank you, Irene. Good morning and welcome. I'm here today from Invitation Homes with Dallas Tanner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer; and Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may reference our second quarter 2022 earnings release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources, and other nonhistorical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures in yesterday's earnings release. With that, let me turn the call over to Dallas.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks Scott and good morning. I'm excited to speak with you today following the release of our second quarter results. The state of the business remains very healthy. Second quarter average occupancy was 98%. We set a new record with trailing 12-month turnover at only 21.3%. Lease growth continued to accelerate including a blended rate of 11.8% that was 380 basis points higher year-over-year and same-store NOI growth was 12.4%. These strong results and our improved expectations for the full year, as provided in our revised guidance, reflect the hard work of our teams and the impact of favorable supply and demand dynamics within our markets. I'd like to discuss these in more detail during my remarks today. First, let me begin with the hard work of our teams. We've been providing a high level of care to single-family residents since we started the business over 10 years ago. As you know we provide 24/7 customer service to our residents routine ProCare visits and a deep and wide bench of dedicated associates. We believe we offer a differentiated and best-in-class experience that is unique to an industry that is still predominantly comprised of smaller mom-and-pop operators. We know that satisfied residents tend to stay with us longer and take better care of their homes. And our customers are telling us they are very satisfied both by their comments and with their actions. We believe our high resident satisfaction ratings high resident retention and high occupancy are among the strongest indicators of our residents' trust satisfaction and loyalty. I, therefore, like to thank our more than 1,400 associates for delivering the best resident experience in the industry and for executing so well operationally again this past quarter. Second, the overall shortage of housing. By some estimates, the United States is undersupplied by as many as 2 million to 4 million homes today. Much of this traces back to the Great Recession and the resulting plummet in the number of single-family housing starts. While construction has gradually improved it remains insufficient to meet existing demand and is predicted to decline again over the next few years. Despite these supply challenges, we continue to offer a valuable choice for those who want to lease a home. This choice is broad-based and in addition to our legacy business now includes options for those preferring a lease-to-own opportunity through our investment in Pathway Homes as well as one for those desiring to lease a home that's been recently constructed by one of our builder partners. Third, I'd like to discuss the strong demand we continue to see for our homes. This is driven by job growth and household formation in our markets and continued migration and population growth particularly within the Sunbelt. It's also driven by age-based demographics. Millennials still represent the largest population segment in the United States at over 70 million people between the ages of 26 and 41 today. With our average new resident age staying really consistent at about 39 years old, we believe many of this generation are or will be attracted to the lifestyle and affordability that leasing a single-family home provides. This demand is further enhanced as a result of more recent and continuing trends, including the need for more space, such as a home office, the popularity of pets and a rise in mortgage rates that made leasing a home a more affordable option compared to homeownership in all of our markets today. I also want to say a few things relating to ESG. We recognize the strength of our business is directly linked to the strength of our communities. In this regard, we've led by our core values, including those of genuine care and standout citizenship. We live out these core values in many ways, including tens of thousands of company paid hours, that our associates spend volunteering in their local communities each year; our invitation to skill up project, which encourages and supports careers in the skilled trades; and also our green spaces programs, which develop and improve outdoor community spaces and promote conservation efforts. The call to be a standout citizen extends to our corporate government practices as well, where we recently moved up in Green Street's annual REIT governance rankings, from one of the top-rated REITs to the highest-rated REIT. Before I wrap up, I want to address the report released this morning by the House Select Subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis. While we have not had time to fully digest the report, there are a few things I'd like to share here. First and perhaps most importantly, the report clearly states that we did not engage in practices that were unlawful, the fact that we've known quite well, since we work hard to follow all the laws within our markets. Second, this report shows just a tiny fraction of the full picture of the work we did during the pandemic and will continue to do so today. We are proud of how we stepped out early to halt all evictions, to fully comprehend the impact of the pandemic and quickly moved to provide flexible payment plans for our residents; contacted residents who had fallen behind in order to help them with flexible payment options or assistance with government assistance; and overall, our team showed the kind of genuine care, we are proud to exhibit on a daily basis. Through these efforts, we provided help to more than 33,000 residents, who are in need of extra time or financial assistance, for a total of nearly $175 million. We also helped over 10,000 residents obtain government assistance payments, totaling more than $94 million. These are the outcomes that matter. At Invitation Homes, we believe everyone should have the choice to live in a great neighborhood. When they choose to lease from us, we're committed to providing the highest quality resident experience possible. We're pleased to have favorable supply and demand fundamentals as a tailwind for our business, and we work hard to offer a best-in-class resident experience, that allows our residents to live freer. With that, I'll pass it on to Charles, our Chief Operating Officer.
Charles Young: Thank you, Dallas. I'd like to start by thanking our associates for another extraordinary quarter during one of our busiest times of the year. It's because of their efforts in providing a premier resident experience that we have achieved such strong operating results. I'm proud of our teams, how they've done in the field and earn such strong recognition and loyalty from our residents. We see this evidenced in many ways, including a record low turnover that Dallas mentioned earlier, our sustained A+ Better Business Bureau rating and certification and our average length of stay approaching three years. I'll now take a moment to review the details of our second quarter 2022 operating performance. Same-store core revenues grew 10.4% year-over-year, which is up from 9.4% year-over-year in the first quarter. Our year-over-year increase was primarily driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 9.4% and a 19.9% increase in other income. These top line results drove same-store NOI growth to 12.4% year-over-year in the second quarter, making four quarters in a row of double-digit same-store NOI growth. This was despite same-store core operating expenses being up 6.2% year-over-year in the second quarter. Our largest expense increases were in property taxes, which were up 4.7% year-over-year in line with our expectations given the recent rise in property values and also on repair and maintenance expense, which was up 15.2% year-over-year and includes the impact of higher labor and material costs across the marketplace. Next, I'll discuss the current leasing environment. We continue to see strong demand through the second quarter into July. New lease growth rate accelerated throughout the second quarter, with June's 17.9% result, surpassing May's 16.5% and April's 15.4%. Blended rate growth was 11.8% for the second quarter, up 380 basis points from last year's strong results. As we sit today, leads are at or near three-year highs, while our application volume remains in line with the last two years. Markets with the strongest new lease growth continued to include Las Vegas and Phoenix and now also include South Florida, Tampa, Orlando as well, reflecting the continued strength of the Sunbelt. Further with our new lease rate growth continuing to significantly exceed renewals, we remain – we maintain a sizable loss to lease that we estimate to be approximately 16% across the portfolio. Together with our historically low turnover, we believe we are well positioned for future rental growth. While these leasing trends are notable so too are new resident incomes. Residents who moved in with us for 12 months ending June 30 had an average annual household income that exceeded $131000. This represented income-to-rent ratio of 5.3 times, which means our new residents are spending on average less than 19% of their annual income on housing. Leasing a home has become increasingly more affordable, given rising mortgage rates and home prices. According to John Burns' latest figures, in all 16 of our markets it is more affordable to lease a single-family home today than it is to buy, by a weighted average savings of almost $700 per month or 24%. Our own internal data shows that the first half of this year compared to the prior year we saw a significant decrease in the number of residents moving out to buy a home. This was the case as measured by both number of move-outs to buy a home, which was down 24% from prior year and also as a percentage of total move-outs, which was down 300 basis points to 26%. And this trend of fewer move-outs to home ownership accelerated this year from the first to second quarter. With just over half of the year behind us, I'm excited by the opportunities in the remaining part of the year to continue to improve and deliver the leasing lifestyle our residents desire. This includes a home that offers individuals and families, the additional space they need is close to work and welcomes their pets, and offers an easy leasing lifestyle that all of our associates do our best to provide each and every day. I'll now turn the call over to Ernie, our Chief Financial Officer.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today I will discuss the following topics: balance sheet and capital markets activity, followed by our financial results for the second quarter, before wrapping up with our updated 2022 guidance. I'll begin with our capital markets activity, starting with our recently announced $725 million unsecured term loan. The seven-year term loan matures in June 2029 and bears interest at adjusted SOFR plus 124 basis points based on our current credit ratings. This pricing includes the benefit we received from meeting certain ESG performance targets similar to our existing unsecured credit facility. The new term loan has a delayed draw feature that allowed us the option to receive a portion of the proceeds at closing, followed by up to three additional draws over a six month period. We elected to draw $150 million of proceeds in our initial funding at closing in June and used the initial proceeds to voluntarily prepay a portion of our secured debt that was scheduled to mature in 2025. As a reminder, at the start of the second quarter, we also closed a $600 million 10-year unsecured public bond offering. The 4.15% senior notes priced at the end of March and are scheduled to mature in April 2032. Net proceeds were also used to voluntarily prepay a portion of our secured debt that was scheduled to mature in 2025. As a result of these capital market activities, we increased our unencumbered pool to approximately 78% of our wholly owned properties and raised the portion of our total debt structure that's unsecured to over 66%. We have no debt coming due until 2025 and our weighted average maturity was 5.8 years at quarter end. At the end of the second quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.9 times within our targeted range of 5.5 to six times As of the end of the second quarter we had nearly $1.8 billion of liquidity including approximately $273 million of cash along with the undrawn capacity of our credit facility and term loan. I'll now touch briefly on my next topic, which is our second quarter 2022 financial results. Core FFO per share increased 13.2% year-over-year to $0.42, primarily due to NOI growth. AFFO per share increased 11.9% year-over-year to $0.36. The last thing I will cover is our updated 2022 guidance. As a result of strong execution and favorable supply and demand fundamentals, we raised our full year 2022 same-store core revenue growth expectations to a range of 9% to 10%, up 100 basis points at the midpoint. While we're coming off two years in a row with exceptionally low expense growth of 1% and 0.5% respectively, as expected inflationary headwinds have been strong this year and are predicted to remain. As a result, we revised our full year 2022 same-store expense growth expectations of 6% to 7%, which is an increase of 50 basis points at the midpoint from prior guidance. All considered, our revised full year 2022 same-store NOI growth guidance has been increased to a range of 10% to 11.5%, up 100 basis points at the midpoint. Regarding investment activity, considering current and anticipated market conditions for the near term, and also due to the cost of capital increasing from both the beginning of the year and more recent expectations, we now expect gross acquisitions for 2022 of approximately $1.5 billion. Through the end of the second quarter, we acquired approximately $800 million of homes on balance sheet and in our joint ventures. With regards to dispositions, we now expect approximately $200 million of proceeds for the year, of which approximately $130 million have closed through the end of the second quarter. Taking these changes into account, we are increasing and tightening our guidance for core FFO and AFFO to reflect our revised outlook. We now expect full year 2022 core FFO of $1.66 to $1.72 per share, which represents an increase of $0.03 per share at the midpoint from previous guidance. AFFO is now expected to be $1.41 to $1.47 per share or an increase of $0.02 per share at the midpoint. I'll close by echoing Dallas' and Charles' comments that we continue to be pleased with the business and our team's execution. Moreover, supply and demand fundamentals remain favorable. We feel well positioned with our loss to lease and low turnover and we remain committed to delivering an exceptional revenue experience. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital. Austin, your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks, everybody. Wanted to just hit on the guidance, first, specifically on revenue. And Ernie, within that revised guidance, I guess, how much embedded deceleration in lease rates are you baking in for the back half of the year? And do you expect the easier occupancy comps to be a modest tailwind moving forward?
Ernie Freedman: Well, two things. On the new lease side, we do expect some seasonal slowdown, but we'll certainly have better numbers than we've seen historically based on where we're at today. But we do expect to see some modest deceleration as we get to the later half in the new lease rates. Renewal rates, we expect to see would be pretty steady. We've been able to achieve low-double-digits or 10%-plus renewal rates. And the way things are shaping up and where those renewal as have gone out for the next few months, we would expect to be a stay in the very high-single-digits or maybe around 10%. Now I would say, the occupancy comp isn't necessarily so easy. We've been in record high occupancy for quite a period of time. So, we're not anticipating that we necessarily have a good guide that would certainly benefit us from the occupancy side. We'd be pleased to see things kind of in a steady state from where it was last year. And that should get us into the middle of the range of our guidance.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ICI. Steve, your line is open.
Steve Sakwa: Yeah. Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could just maybe talk about the development opportunities and whether you see the opportunity to further expand that, just given the housing shortage that we've got in the US, and just how you sort of see that unfolding over the next couple of years.
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Steve, this is Dallas. Great question. It's certainly been by design that we wanted to have a structure in place where we could work with some of the nation's best builders to develop a pipeline that we believe over time becomes very influential. Today, we've got about 2,300 homes in that pipeline with our national builder partners. And I would say, your inclination is right where we probably have an even greater opportunity to bring additional supply into the fold. The nice thing about these structures, as you know, is we're under the hood early with our partners and we can influence things like floor plans, fit and finish standards, even sometimes community layouts, and that's been a really advantageous position with us, but being very balance sheet-sensitive. And so, we would expect that if there is a little bit of a slowdown, those partnership opportunities should be that much more appealing both to our partners and to us. And I would expect for us both in how we think about growth and also how we think about shaping the portfolio to have our builder structures play a major part in that over the coming years. There's no doubt about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nicholas Joseph from Citi. Nicholas, your line is open.
Nicholas Joseph: Thank you. Just maybe on acquisition guidance coming down a bit. Is that more a reflection of your cost of capital or is it opportunity set? And then how are you thinking about funding that growth in the back half of the year?
Dallas Tanner: It's a little bit of everything Nick. First of all we don't love where our cost of capital is today to be fair on balance sheet. But we've done a nice job of building out our investment management business over the last couple of years, so we think that will lend itself to additional opportunities in the future. In terms of the market and pricing changing with particular assets, it's still a little early. I think we've taken a little bit of a cautious approach through summer wanting to see where supply could shake out. Because we're certainly long investors, so it's candidly impossible to be perfect in terms of how you buy an asset every day. But we do want to see where the -- some of these submarkets start to settle out. We think there could be some even better buying opportunities towards the end of the year. So we've been methodical in our approach. Ernie?
Ernie Freedman: And Nick to address the question around capital. So we do anticipate the $1.5 billion and these are year-to-date numbers Nick that we'll end up with about $700 million of balance sheet acquisitions for the year and about $800 million will be funded through our joint ventures. With that, we do have capital available to do more whether it's on balance sheet or on the joint ventures without raising any more capital this year without increasing leverage. We'll actually end the year with more cash than we would have thought because we're bringing the guidance down a little bit. So if we do see the market change in a way that's favorable for us, we can take advantage of that with capital either in our joint ventures or some balance sheet capital. And, of course, if our cost of capital change that could also be another way.
Nicholas Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital. Brad, your line is open.
Brad Heffern: Hi everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Are you getting more calls from your homebuilder partners looking to offload supply? And how do you look at the attractiveness of that versus the traditional MLS channel right now?
Dallas Tanner: Every -- on the one-off opportunities, most definitely over the last month it feels like a lot of our partners have been calling us because they've had some cancellations. I think you've seen some of that even in the news releases that are out there. So, yes, I would say almost call it two Fed raises ago when they moved at 75 basis points for the first time, it felt like we had a lot of cancellations in communities that we were active in and we're able to take some advantage of that. I think wholesale programmatic things? No, I think the pipeline takes a little bit of time to develop but we'd expect that we might see more opportunities towards the latter part of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley. Adam, your line is open.
Adam Kramer: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. So I think your core NOI margins in the -- kind of like -- right? So Western US is at 75% or so. Texas and the Midwest are a little bit below 60%. Just wondering what drives the differences in margins across those regions. Are there structural differences there? Can margins in Texas and the Midwest be raised over time? Just wondering about the, I guess, kind of the dispersion of the margins and the sustainability of those margins given the record low turnover that we have?
Ernie Freedman: Yeah. I mean it's a good question. We certainly think across all the markets there's going to be opportunities for us to improve margins still. But really the reason you see the wide difference across our portfolio is because of our fixed expenses. In certain states, property taxes run much higher than in other states and that's mainly because of whether there's an income tax in those states or not. So, for instance, in the State of Florida, in the State of Texas there's not a personal income tax but funds are raised by local jurisdictions by having higher property taxes than maybe in other states. The other item that has a wide dispersion across our portfolio would be the insurance costs, and so for instance any of our markets that have exposure to windstorm. So again the Florida market as well as Houston specifically and the Texas market are going to have significantly higher property insurance rates incurring costs versus other markets. And then just the cost to operate is a third item, but that's much less or so. And so that's why you see markets like Phoenix that have low insurance rate and lower property taxes. Market like California, even though it has higher insurance, because of earthquake has lower property taxes because of Prop 13. You see that wide range of NOI margins. That will certainly continue to exist in the portfolio. But overtime there's opportunities across the portfolio to hopefully improve margins in each of our markets.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Powell from Barclays. Anthony, your line is open.
Anthony Powell: Hi. Good morning. Question on renewals versus new lease spreads they converged a bit in the past few quarters. I know you want to be prudent in terms of pushing rate on renewals. That said is there more of an opportunity to maybe be a bit more aggressive there given the overall dynamics in rental housing across your markets?
Charles Young: Yeah. As we said from the beginning -- this is Charles here. We've been really tough on renewals. As you can see we've been pushing up almost every quarter every month for the last year or so, breaking into the low-10% here. Ernie mentioned it, we're -- for September and October we're out in the mid-10s, 10.5, 10.4. So I expect that we're going to stay steady there. And what you'll see is we're kind of in really nice new lease spreads, but accelerating from Q2 to Q3. Naturally we'll see that stay high in Q3. But as we move into Q4 you'll see some seasonal slowdown. And I think those spreads will start to -- between the new lease and renewals start to converge a bit. And given our loss to lease that I mentioned earlier, we think that those renewals are going to stay steady for a little while as we try to catch-up and clean up there. So we've been thoughtful. Low turnover is a good thing for this business. We look at it in terms of our markets and where we think market is. But on an individual home or a submarket our local teams are really thoughtful around are we pushing the rent too much? We're not we don't have any really hard caps other than where we're required in California, but we are thoughtful about how we do that and where we go. And you can see we're still steadily pushing that number up. So we're going to keep finding that right balance and I think we're putting up good numbers overall.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Haendel, your line is open.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you, and good morning guys. I guess, Ernie, maybe you could help us understand what's going on with the collection stats. Why have revenues, collected in the same month remained so low versus pre-COVID levels? Your net bad debt improved I think 100 basis points to 70 basis points I believe, but there was no real movement in the better collections in the month. I understand that rental assistance has helped, but what happens when that runs out? Will bad debt move up again? So maybe you could help us understand what's going on here. Thanks.
Ernie Freedman: Yeah. Haendel it's certainly -- it's been a new experience for all of us dealing with collections in a pandemic period. And certainly in hindsight it's not has been as predictable as we hope it would be. You're right to point out, that we've been pretty consistent in terms of collecting current rents. Historically we collected about 96% of our rents current and then, people were catching up for the next three and change. We got to a low 99% collection rate in the past. What we've seen over the last many quarters is we've kind of been steady around 91% 92% in terms of current rent being paid. And then we have some volatility around the past rents being paid in terms of people catching up sometimes with the help of rental assistance sometimes without just people getting the opportunity to catch-up. And we were surprised in the first quarter with where our results came out to the bad with regards to what happened with collections. So we had a bigger bad debt number than we expected. But then, we were surprised to the good in the second quarter offsetting it. So year-to-date we're still a bit off from where we thought we would be. But then, over the longer six-month period it's kind of closer to where we thought things would be. I suspect there certainly could be some timing issues with regards to what happens to bad debt over the next period of time here at Dallas as rent assistance will drop off and new application is not being accepted. But our application is still being processed. And we received rent assistance in July and we'll certainly likely receive some rent assistance in August. But we are also seeing some good things happening with regards to people getting more current as we move past the pandemic period and we've been able to work -- continue to work with folks. So it could mean there is some noise in the second half of the year around bad debt in terms of it coming out at a number that's more like what it was for the average in the first half of the year versus what you saw in the second quarter. And it's kind of we're not too far off from what we thought we said at the beginning of the year that we don't expect to get to our historical numbers here in 2022. And sitting here today now seven, eight months into the year, we certainly feel very strongly about that statement that we will not get to our historical bad debt numbers and collection numbers before the end of this year. It will likely take some time into 2023 before we get closer to that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Choe from Credit Suisse. Sam, your line is open.
Sam Choe: Hi, guys. I just wanted to focus a little bit on the operating expense side. How much of the R&M increase was due to the seasonal turnover quarter-over-quarter versus the inflationary pressures? And then also on utilities, what led to that uptick quarter-over-quarter?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. So, Sam, we generally look at a more a year-over-year basis versus sequentially because of the seasonality of the business. Quarter-over-quarter, we always do see a big increase in repairs and maintenance costs from the first quarter to the second quarter. They stay elevated in the third quarter. And that's really around HVAC season, air conditioning. And as we all know, it's a pretty hot summer. So we're certainly seeing a little bit more of that this year than we did last year. So a little bit is that. But the majority of the year-over-year difference is around inflation. We had a couple of years in a row where our total net cost to maintain and our R&M costs were really under control in terms of modest increases. But the environment we've been in now for almost 12 months really kind of started toward the tail end of the third quarter, certainly, grew in the fourth quarter and continued to grow in the first and second quarter of this year, is we're in a pretty significant inflationary environment on the R&M side. So that's certainly been, I think, a challenge for a lot of companies across the board. We're not immune to that. And you throw a hot summer on top of that as well we're seeing the elevated R&M costs. And we do expect those to continue for the remainder of the year in our guidance. With regards to utilities, there's a few other items that we group in that as well. And so, I think, the bigger challenge there is a bunch of different items associated with that. And so, the utility costs are definitely up across the board. We're responsible for utilities where the homes are vacant. And so, because of that, we're seeing increases and we're not immune to what's happening in the market with regards to utility costs.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Jade, your line is open.
Jade Rahmani: Thank you, very much. On the investment side, capital deployment side, how are you seeing the market adjust currently? Are you seeing cap rates move in any material way? Are you seeing investors slow down their purchases as they assess their cost of capital? What are you seeing in terms of those trends? I know it will eventually be probably a big opportunity for Invitation Homes considering its institutionalization, its strong balance sheet. But in the current market what are you seeing? Thanks very much.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Jade. This is Dallas. We certainly feel equally as confident about our capabilities if the opportunities present themselves. I think, so far, we haven't seen much movement in pricing. In fact, it's still been a relatively active home buying season across the board for both buyers and sellers as well as maybe investors through summer. I think the Case-Shiller Index through the end of March, early April, our markets is still like 23%. So we're still seeing significant home price appreciation, albeit, is starting to moderate to some degree. So the backdrop of not having enough supply isn't going to turn on big changes in cap rates overnight. And there still is a buyer in the marketplace even with a higher cost of mortgage, given the amount of pressure. But with that being said, we would expect that as you get into Q3, Q4, later in the year is typically a little bit slower season, you might see some opportunities start to develop. And I think it's really hard to forecast beyond that. We just got to see how the economy is, what's happening with the consumer. Builders, I would imagine, are going to start to be a little bit more careful in terms of deliveries and things like that as well. So it could lead to, like, an extended supply-constrained environment, truthfully. So that may offset any potential cap rate gains or things that you would hope that you might be able to see in the marketplace. But feel generally pretty healthy right now. I think a quarter ago if you had asked me, Jade, about if we're making an offer on a one-off property, we're probably competing with eight to 10 other buyers. And in the market today it feels like you might be competing with three to four, just given where rates have gone and things like that. So that's really kind of the current color on the ground.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keegan Carl from Berenberg Capital. Keegan, your line is open.
Keegan Carl: Yes, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just when we think about same-store occupancy declining 40 basis points in the quarter, what were the main drivers of that? Are you seeing any more pushback on elevated rate increases causing move-outs?
Charles Young: No. We really haven't. I think we're just getting back to a normal environment. As you think about last year with COVID, and kind of where we were in that environment, we now see people starting to move again. And we're getting back to our kind of normal kind of seasonal curve that we've seen. And if you look at our quarter at 98% occupancy, it's still very good. And so I think this is just kind of getting back to a natural area. And we're doing that, also by making sure that we're capturing the new lease rate that's out there, as we start to push renewals. So I wouldn't – I have no disappointment in our 98% occupancy. It's very strong. You look back at 98.3% that's not naturally where we are. We're typically much lower than that in Q2 and Q3, because that's the time when people move out, as they're looking for schools for their kids and all of that. But I would pay attention to our low turnover number that's sub-22% and 21%. It's just really healthy. And that just shows that, we have homes in the right areas and we're providing the right service and people like what we're doing, including our extra ancillary services and the like. So 98% feels really good. I would think in Q3, you might see it come down, or stay right around there maybe a little bit and then you'll start to see it go back up in Q4. That's the seasonal curve we typically see, and I think we're getting back to that normal curve.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tyler Batory from Oppenheimer. Tyler, your line is open.
Tyler Batory: Good morning. Thank you. A follow-up question on turnover. What's included in the guide in terms of turnover for the second half of this year? Do you expect that metric to remain pretty low just given some of the challenges for affordability out there? Are you expecting it to pick up a little bit? And I guess, as we look at the guidance, if turnover continues to move lower or perhaps stays, where it is right now could that be a little bit of a tailwind to the guidance that you provided?
Ernie Freedman: Yeah. Tyler, we continue to see a month – comparing month-to-month, year-over-year that turnover is lower this year than it was last year. We continue to expect to see that for the foreseeable future, as we finish out the year. So we think we have turnover numbers will continue to stay in that low range as Charles just talked about better than we saw last year in terms of – and more favorable in terms of a little bit lower. And we'll just have to see whether we can do better still, or it goes slightly the other direction, but we think we have a room with our range to cover that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pawlowski from Green Street. John, your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Hey, thanks for time. With turnover continue going down and length of stay increasing Ernie or Charles, could you take a stab at quantifying just how much deferred kind of total cost to maintain is in the portfolio right now we might see come through the system once turnover starts to normalize?
Ernie Freedman: Yeah. John, we certainly have seen as people are staying longer in the portfolio, we're seeing that our cost of turn is increasing and increasing a little bit faster than inflationary. To give you a number off the top of our head, here, wouldn't be appropriate at this point. But certainly, as people have been there longer, we do expect those costs to rise a little bit. But also remember, we have our ProCare maintenance, and then when we go out to the home once not twice a year, to make sure things are in a good spot. It gives us an opportunity to make sure that things are in the place where they need to be. So we don't expect there to be a material change. It should put some pressure on the cost to turn that might be a little bit more than inflationary pressure but not meaningfully different.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Malkin from Capital One. Neil, your line is open.
Neil Malkin: Thank you. Good morning. Charles, a question for you on the operating side. So it's very important in terms of resident relationships and expectations that you as the regional manager, a regional team that are well versed well trained well equipped to handle a variety of problems that can occur just – again, this is someone's home, so they probably have always a sense of urgency and emotional connection. So, can you just maybe generally talk about how you guys go about training and sort of doing like continuing education or improvement to have your regional managers, or your people-facing staff ready to handle questions making people stay as enjoyable, so it reflects well on the company? And maybe if you can give something like an average maintenance request average time to being fixed or something as just another way to kind of help us understand how all those things work? Thank you.
Charles Young : Yes. No. Great question. Look, we're really proud of our approach in what we do in the field. We've been doing this for a while now. And part of what is special about us is all of the talented team members that we have in our markets that are -- we break them into pods and groups that are focused on homes and those residents. And as they are either turning those homes or dealing with work orders -- and when you take a step back, we do over 500,000 work orders a year. And we survey our residents and their overall experience on every interaction, whether it's a work order or a work order from our vendor and the like. And I think the vast majority of our residents are just really happy with what we're doing. And in my mind they vote with their feet and their wallets 98% occupancy, or low turnover, or 79% renewal rate, the BBB things, the rating that I talked about. Google and Yelp score is over 4%. We measure them. We measure ourselves and we use that when we track as to your question on how we train and make sure that our residents -- our associates are up to speed to provide a great experience for our residents. Our brand really is about that experience. It's the quality of the homes, the location of the homes and then how responsive we are to those residents. Do we get it right 100% of the time? No. There are some things and hundreds of moving parts in the house. In any business you're going to have a couple of instances. But generally, we really like what we're doing, and we continually get better and we make sure that we train our teams. We do national things that come out of the central team, and we do things locally to make sure that our people are trained. We also have -- as we bring new employees on, we're making sure that they're up to speed and that's kind of an ongoing effort we need to do. Your last question is around response time. Let's be clear, there are multiple avenues in which someone can request a maintenance request. So it could be through our new maintenance mobile app. It could be on our website, so online portal or they can call our 24/7 call center. And when we do that there's -- the requests all go through the same criteria and we really break it down in terms of what's an emergency request, what's urgent and what's kind of a normal fix that might be taken care of in a ProCare service or done or scheduled on the timing of when the resident wants to let us in. Again, we don't have permission to enter. So we have to schedule along with the residents. The thing I want to be clear about is, if there is an emergency we're there within 24 hours. And that's what really matters for us to make sure that we're getting those and that's about 20% of the work orders that come through. So when you take an average of how long it takes us to respond, it's really an average between, whether it's urgent, whether it's in normal course, or something that may need to be coordinated. And then the last thing I would add is, historically, about 75% of our work orders are handled on that first visit. So that's a big thing for our residents. They want us to come in and be done. Sometimes there's follow-up and we'll come back. But generally, we're responding quickly. We're showing up and finishing that job within that first unless there is some follow-on that needs to be done. Bottom line is, we're proud of what we've been doing, and we continuously improve and use that as training opportunities for our teams.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Dennis, your line is open.
Dennis McGill: Hi. Thank you. Ernie just going back to the bad debt. There's a lot of different numbers, I guess, as we talk about the collections and the reserve and rental assistance and so forth. Can you maybe just peel apart the 0.7% number that we see on the P&L between what the gross reserve was in the quarter, and then the puts and takes to get us down to that the rental assistance and so forth?
Ernie Freedman : Dennis we really analyze it unfortunately on that number. Certainly, you're going to have some netting against that as some stuff becomes due. And then we have rent assistance that comes in that goes up against it. That's how we disclose and how we talk about it. I'd rather not confuse the issue more by throwing other metrics out there that I think we list what the bad debt is and it's at 70 bps.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital. Juan, your line is open.
Juan Sanabria: Good afternoon. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about expectations with regards to CapEx, for homes given the inflationary environment and kind of the rough numbers for remodeling now that you're factoring in, as you buy homes as part of that normal process just to think about kind of the go-forward run rate.
Ernie Freedman: Juan, for the last few years we had had our recurring maintenance CapEx reserve, which took into account work that we did for repairs and maintenance as well as churn. For the last many years ahead of this year it was running -- they ran that consistently about $1,500 per home. So again that's the CapEx side, of our net cost to maintain. There was really no increase. We're able to offset any inflationary increases that we had during those periods of times, granted when inflation was much lower than it was today, through productivity through being able to get better contracts in place for procurement. And certainly lower turnover helped somewhat in that number as well. We're certainly trending toward a higher number this year, that could be as much as 20% or more, higher than what that was in the past. So if you take the $1,500 we're probably, trending something that's going to be closer to $1,800 this year. Going forward, we'll just have to see. We do anticipate at some point inflation is going to come down. Very hard to predict when that's going to be, we get to a more normalized environment. And certainly in a lot of cases, we're seeing less pressure on the supply chain. And then, if we're going to some economic uncertainty, it's possible we're going to see less pressure on the labor side, going forward as well. That could help us out. So I think over the long-term, Juan, we would expect that increases would be closer to inflation, it's hard to fight inflation with the opportunity through our scale and our size and what we do to maybe do a little bit better than that. But certainly in this environment, especially coming off a few years where things are more challenging -- or excuse me more favorable to us, but the comps kind of creates a more challenging comparison for us this year. And so I think, that's why you're seeing the outsized growth.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chandni Luthra from Goldman Sachs. Chandni, your line is open
Chandni Luthra: Hi, this is Chandni. Thank you for taking my question. Could you give us an update, on where things stand on the legal front? I believe your arguments are filed just last week or more recently. Could you give us an update there? And what's the next step in that process? Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Yes. This is Dallas. I think you're asking about the qui tam suit that we're dealing with in the state of California. No, real update. I'll say that we had published I think in mid-July our response as part of the process. And now the judge has it in their hands on the motion to dismiss. And we've been told that these can take anywhere from three to six months, to get a ruling on that. And then what happens beyond that, is indicative of where we stand there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. Joshua, your line is open.
Joshua Dennerlein: Hi, everyone. Just kind of curious on the expense front. I know there's been kind of record heat waves across kind of the country. Just kind of thinking about potential for higher AC repair needs, is this something you're seeing or something maybe you factored in?
Charles Young: Yes. No. Look, we always know in the summer as it heats up that this is going to be a higher expense period. So that's baked into our numbers. But you can never tell, kind of how hot it's going to be. And there are some regions this summer, that are just hotter than we've seen. And so that's starting to show up in the numbers a little bit this quarter, and I expect in Q2 and we'll expect to see through a bit of Q3. So we always know that that's there. And we try to get out ahead of it to make sure that, we have our vendors on call. We think about any preventative maintenance, we can do with our ProCare service. But ultimately, we have to show up when there is any challenge. And we treat it always the same, where we go in and evaluate whether it's a repair or replace, based on what's going on. And when you have this type of heat, you just need to be ready. Our teams have been responding well. And when there are any instances, as I talked about before, from a customer service, we're going to be really thoughtful around how we support our residents through that. So this is normal course, maybe a little hotter than normal and we'll see how it all plays out. Hopefully, it'll cool off a little bit.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Linda, your line is open.
Linda Tsai.: Thank you. In terms of the loss of the lease of 16% across the portfolio, can you discuss regional differences and how that's trending?
Ernie Freedman: Linda, this is Ernie. We do look at that more on an overall basis. There's no really markets that stick out too much with possibly the exception of California because of the rules associated with what we can do on the renewal side. So, we do see in California the loss to lease is bigger than in other parts of the country which would make sense. We're certainly seeing it in markets where we're seeing more recent higher activity like Florida.  So Florida has really taken off in the last six to eight months where some of our markets like Phoenix and Las Vegas have been great for the last 15 to 18 months. So, Florida is certainly leaning toward being more of an outperformer. And then on the weaker side would be the markets where we're generally seeing again on a relative basis the weaker activity markets like in the Midwest, Chicago, Minneapolis a market like Houston. But California, most of our Sunbelt markets and especially Florida would have a disproportionate higher amount of loss to lease relative to the other markets.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is a follow-up question from Nicholas Joseph from Citi.
Michael Bilerman: Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Nick. I just had two follow-ups. One, just Dallas, just on the lawsuit. I assume not only are you spending a lot of time, but you're spending some money in defending the company. So maybe just outline how much capital was spent in the second quarter and if there's any expectation at least in guidance for what you may spend the rest of the year. And then I just had a follow-up on a separate topic.
Ernie Freedman: Michael, it's Ernie. It's really been pretty de-minimis on the lawsuit at this point because as you've seen we just filed briefs. We've certainly done a lot of work internally to understand where we're at, but it's in the low tens of hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's not a big number. We're not going to disclose specifically what we're spending on any specific loss or any legal activity, but it's not something that's material nor do we expect it to become material at this stage as we think about our guidance. And we'll just have to see how this plays out over the next period of time and what may or may not be required depending on the judge's ruling.
Operator: Thank you. Our next follow-up question comes from John Pawlowski from Green Street. John, your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Just a follow-up on the qui tam complaint. I know we have to wait for the legal process to play out. But curious, Dallas in your own internal review have you seen anything that makes you change your opinion? I think you've voiced at the Citi conference where you feel good about the facts. And if we're wrong and I don't think we are if we're wrong the financial impact would be pretty de-minimis. Is there anything you've seen to change that view?
Dallas Tanner: No. Nothing from our viewpoint has changed. We feel good about the facts we have. Charles and the whole operating team do a really good job of running, not only the right processes, but the right checks and balances. But again we've got to let the -- these are the kind of the unfortunate things about being a public company. You get picked on from time to time and I'm not sure the motive's always pure in terms of why companies have to deal with some of this stuff. But we'll just deal with it. No change in terms of our internal view.
Operator: Thank you. Another follow-up question comes from Nicholas Joseph from Citi. Nicholas, your line is open.
Nicholas Joseph: I'm back. I guess the line gets muted after you ask. So, I prefer not to go on a whole diatrive and get into a little bit of a conversation. But two questions. One was just going off on the lawsuit is there anything that we should read into from the Washington Post article where they brought in Charlotte and Orlando effectively trying to highlight that this may not just be a California issue? The second topic I wanted to follow up on was, Ernie on your comment about -- I think you said, we don't love our cost of capital. And just to drill in both from an equity and debt perspective obviously you did the debt earlier in the spring. Those bonds are yielding about 5% today from a debt perspective and your equity is in a low four cap. And while you're not at the mid-40s where you peaked from a stock price perspective, you're high 30s at this point. I'm just trying to understand your sort of -- is it the debt side or the equity side? Is it both? And where does that capital that you get comfortable with in terms of issuing it for external purposes?
Charles Young: Hey, this is Charles. I'll start on the first part of your question around the Washington Post article. To Dallas' comments around the qui tam, look we like and understand exactly what's going on here and we know that we do this thing the right way. And we disagree with the Post's premise that they laid out there. And we recognize we're in a bit of a moment. I think, it's time to try to, kind of, step back and think about our business. And our approach is as we -- our business plan and when we target an acquisition it's typically a light improvement that we're going after about 10% of the purchase price $25,000 -- $35,000. And we try to avoid properties that need heavy work or really require permits. And when we look at our numbers, 80% of what we do is cosmetic. And when I say cosmetics let's just think about that. It's paint, flooring, it's cleaning, it's landscaping. Maybe some cabinet work, a little bit of countertops, some lighting interior exterior. That's 80% of what we do and typically would not require any permits at all. And so when we -- this is our business. We've been doing this for a while. And we've kind of broken that down and looked even further. If you think about what might need permits it's really only about 6% of our spend, which would be like a roof replacement or a large HVAC replacement or something like that. And that remaining 10% or 14% are -- would be a fence or depending on the municipality would be unlikely to require a permit. The point of all that is we know what we're doing here. Our teams do a great job. We work with contractors locally that are licensed. They know the local laws. They -- and we rely and we make sure that we hold them accountable in terms of the applicable laws and what they need to do on permit. So as we look at this we see no other kind of risk out there that's going to make a big difference.
Ernie Freedman: Michael, it's Ernie. To address your second part of your question with regards to our cost of capital. Yes, we look at the components very specifically. On the debt side, we were able to raise the unsecured term loan at SOFR -- adjusted SOFR plus 124. So we certainly like that cost of capital. We've drawn $150 million of that to pay down one of the pieces of secured debt -- within the range of where we want to be from leverage right now. So if we saw a really good buying opportunity, we certainly consider using some of the unfunded proceeds that remain about $575 million do some modest buying on the balance sheet if we thought so because that certainly would be a good cost of capital if we do that. So we want to balance those two things. That said overall, we're not looking to really increase our leverage much from where it is if at all because we are within our range, but we certainly have the capability to use some leverage. And to your point leverage especially, what we just recently raised would certainly be favorable for that. From an equity perspective, the stock price has certainly been extremely volatile for all the companies out there over this last period of time. It's really hard to time something exactly around that. But we're not so much focused on where we were at Michael. That's history. We want to focus on what our opportunity is at hand, and compare that to how we can deploy that capital and would that be accretive for shareholders whether it's on an NAV basis, whether it's on an earnings basis. When the stock is trading in the mid-30s based on how we view a valuation we would certainly say that would not be accretive. As we get closer -- if it potentially increases and gets somewhere higher than where it's been in the last many months, it's certainly potentially more of an option for us. But then again, we want to marry that up against where we can buy, and see where cap rates as Dallas talked about earlier ultimately kind of land over this next period of time for homes whether we're buying them from our builder partners, whether we are buying them off the MLS like we traditionally do. So we'll certainly stay nimble. And the nice thing is we buy homes about $350,000 to $400,000 at a time. So it certainly gives us some more optionality that other people might not have in terms of the size of capital that needs to be raised to be able to fund future growth and we'll be prepared to do that if we think we're in a favorable position both in terms of the buying opportunity and the capital opportunity.
Operator: Thank you. Our last follow-up question comes from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Jade, your line is open.
Jade Rahmani: Have you talked about on this call -- and I apologize, if I missed it under a modest recession scenario where you think occupancy might trend? Just curious as to what you think some of the risk sensitivities are that we should be focused on. And also, if you think that rent growth would still remain positive considering the constrained supply environment? Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Jade, this is Dallas. Good question. Look I think our business is really well positioned as a recessionary hedge quite frankly. I think we've seen it a little bit in turnover ratio say in the last 90 days as we've seen mortgage rates and a few things, maybe impact people's thinking in a time where we would traditionally see more volatility in our leasing program because we have more people moving out to homeownership and doing some things like that. So I think we're insulated. And one of the things I've loved about this business and I've almost been doing this now close to 20 years is how resilient SFR is over time and over distance. In a previous life, we had about 1,000 rentals I shared with some of you in Phoenix back in the last crisis of 2007 and 2008. While you get a little bit more muted on your rent growth, it's just more of like a CPI type of number our occupancy stayed really steady through the Great Recession in that kind of 96% 96.5% range. So I feel really good about -- and by the way we didn't have the tools the resources or the platform which Invitation Homes is now. I think we've developed a really good track record with our current customers. I think it's evidenced in the retention rates and in the renewals that we're seeing. And I also think our service levels are getting that much better. So I think in a recessionary environment, if people have got to make a decision about where they want to live and how they want to spend their own capital. We're really in a position of strength, coupled with the fact that right now our rent to income ratio is approaching 5.3 times, the customer is spending somewhere around 17% or 18% of their monthly rent with us. So I just think we're really well positioned. We're in the right markets for a recessionary environment and we've got a product that quite frankly as Ernie pointed out people want and need in the right areas. So I think we're well positioned for this next chapter.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, currently we have no further questions. Therefore, I would like to hand back to Mr. Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: We just want to thank everyone for their support of the company and we look forward to seeing you all either in person or on our next earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for being with us today. Have a lovely day ahead. You may disconnect your lines now.

Operator: 00:04 Welcome to the Invitation Homes First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ruby and I will be your moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] 00:17 I will now hand over to your host, Scott McLaughlin to begin. Scott, please go ahead.
Scott McLaughlin: 00:23 Good morning and welcome. I'm here today from Invitation Homes with Dallas Tanner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer; and Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer. 00:38 During this call, we may reference our first quarter 2022 earnings press release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. 01:22 We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures in yesterday’s earnings release. 01:55 With that, let me turn the call over to Dallas.
Dallas Tanner: 01:59 Thanks, Scott and good morning to those of you joining us today. We believe the fundamental tailwinds remain a strong as ever for our business, and I'm pleased by our team's solid execution that achieved our first quarter results. On the heels of Invitation Homes 10-year anniversary, it is clear that we've built a great real estate business that own and operate for lease product with first rate service, but that's just a foundation as our success is determined by the genuine care and the premier experience we provide to our residents every day, and the loyalty and trust our residents place in us. 02:32 We see this evidenced by our average resident tenure of nearly 32 months. Occupancy of over 98% with extraordinary resident retention and work order satisfaction scores of over 4.7 out of 5. To the nearly 1 million residents, who made a house a home with us and especially to all of our associates, thank you for 10 great years. 02:54 I often speak about how our homes are attracted to a resident demographic. There is not only growing, those preferences continue to evolve. This continues to play out with a large population surge of younger adults, just beginning to approach our average resident age of 39 years old. A common theme within this millennial cohort is that they want to live freer, meaning they want more choice and flexibility in their lives, including how and where they live? The pandemic accelerated this shift with many people choosing to move from tight quarters in higher cost cities to working from a home in a new location with great schools and a higher quality of life. 03:32 More recently the macroeconomic environment including rising mortgage rates has met leasing a home is often a more affordable option than owning. According to recent data from John Burns, leasing a home is over 12% more affordable on average than owning a home within our markets. These factors and more have led to unprecedented demand for our product, which is an intensified due to a lack of available high quality well located homes. 03:58 At Invitation Homes, we're proud to be a part of the solution to this imbalance, by offering choice and flexibility within housing. One way, we're offering this is through our partnerships with homebuilders across the country, as well as through our recently announced ventures with Rockpoint and Pathway homes. 04:17 I'll start with our builder relationships, which are helping to add new residential housing supply and expand choice for consumers, where it's needed the most. Our current approach keeps development risk off of our balance sheet and partners us with some of the best in the business to select and buy new homes in great locations. We've talked a lot about our preferred relationship with Pulte Homes, which continues to progress towards our goal of buying 7,500 homes over the next several years. 04:43 We're also working with other national, regional and local homebuilders. Through these relationships as at the end of the first quarter, we've build a pipeline of nearly 2,000 new homes and in a disciplined way we're adding more every month. Most of these projects, we're helping builders bring online will include a mix of owner occupied and for lease homes, which underscores our firm belief that everyone should have the choice live in a great neighborhood, whether they lease or own. So we're proud to be bringing not just new homes, but new and diverse communities to life. 05:15 Another example is our latest Rockpoint joint venture, which we announced last month to specialized in premium location, higher price point homes for lease. These homes will offer superior locations within our markets and open up investment opportunities where we have limited or nor current product. And they also provide us an opportunity to invest in additional projects with our homebuilder partners. 05:38 In Phoenix, for example, that might be a home in a submarket like Scottsdale or in the plan on the submarket of Dallas. In turn, we believe resins results may want a higher level of convenience and live easy amenities and choose to spend more on ancillary and other services. We expect the new JV to begin buying homes soon with us earning asset and property management fees in addition to our share of income as we target this new premium segment. 06:02 Another example is, our investment in Pathway Homes. Pathway works directly with aspiring homeowners to identify and purchase a home, offering them the opportunity to lease their home first, with an option to buy later date, if they choose. Pathway has started acquiring homes and as well on the way to providing residents the choice at least today with the flexibility to buy tomorrow, if they so desire. 06:30 To further our commitment to choice and flexibility and in response to the ongoing strong demand for our homes for lease, we plan to keep growing our portfolio this year. We plan to leverage our multi-channel acquisition strategy, our proprietary AcquisitionIQ technology and our localized in markets to help us grow prudently where pricing, total risk-adjusted returns and scale make the most sense. We're targeting total gross acquisition, including through our JVs $2 billion this year. We continue to make good progress so far in that regard with plenty of opportunities still in front of us. 07:01 In summary, whether it's through our growth, our homebuilder relationships or our strategic partnerships. We're very proud of our 10-year history of providing choice and flexibility in housing, along with a best-in-class resident experience that allows our residents to live freer. On behalf of this great company and fantastic team, I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities the next 10 years will bring, as we remain committed to being part of the overall housing solution that this nation needs. 07:28 And with that, I'll pass it on to Charles, our Chief Operating Officer.
Dallas Tanner: 07:33 Thank you, Dallas. As Dallas mentioned this year is off to a strong start, with solid fundamentals helping our teams achieve higher retention, attractive rate growth, strong occupancy and above all premier resident service. 07:48 Let's walk through the first quarter operating results in more detail. Our same-store NOI growth remained over 10% for the third quarter in a row, coming in at 11.7% in the first quarter of 2022. Same-store core revenues grew 9.4% driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 8.3% and a 47.1% increase in other income. 08:11 Average occupancy remained strong at 98.1% for the first quarter, which marks 18 consecutive months that occupancy has paid at or above 98%. Meanwhile resident turnover remains at historic lows with first quarter turnover at 4.6%. Demand continues to increase compared to prior -- to the prior year. We have seen increasing traffic to our website, from prospective residents including over 20% increases in the number of new website visitors in favor to virtual tours. 08:44 We believe this demand as evidenced by our leasing activity with new lease rate growth of 14.8% for the quarter and renewal rate growth up 9.7%. This drove blended rent growth to 10.9% of 550 basis points year-over-year. We continue to take a balance look at our renewal rates each month compared to market rents. As a result, we believe we have a sizable loss to lease nearing 20% with our average rent across the portfolio of almost $2,100 significantly below current market rates. 09:15 On the expense side, as everyone knows just about everything cost more in the current inflationary environment, but through the efforts of our teams, we were pleased to hold same-store core operating expense growth of 4.5% during the first quarter year-over-year. The two biggest contributors to increase were property taxes, which were up 4.3% along with repair and maintenance expense, which was up 18.9% primarily due to a challenging comparison to prior year and higher costs. Lower turnover meanwhile continues to help offset some of these rising costs with a 12.4% decline from last year. 09:53 To help us control costs, we continue to seek efficiencies through tech enhancements. This includes our mobile maintenance app that we launched last year, which has been a big win-win for our residents and us. Using their smartphone, residents can easily send us photos and videos of their service need, allowing our technicians to better prepare when they arrive. In turn the significantly reduces the need for follow-up visits resulting in higher customer satisfaction and allowing our service technicians to be more productive. 10:24 For the first time a number of maintenance requests we receive from digital methods exceeded those from our call center, and we expect the mobile maintenance app to continue to drive the shift. I'm pleased to see technology make our processes more efficient while remembering it's our people who make the difference. Thanks to the continued strong demand for our homes, our strategic execution above all the efforts of our associates to put our residents first, we stand on great footing for peak season. I'd like to thank our teams for another successful quarter. 10:55 I'll now turn the call over to Ernie, our Chief Financial Officer.
Ernie Freedman: 10:59 Thank you, Charles. Today, I will discuss the following three topics, balance sheet and capital markets activity, followed by our investment activity during the quarter, before closing with our first quarter financial results. First, balance sheet and capital markets activity. At the end of March, we priced our third public bond offering that totaled $600 million. The offering advances our stated objective to proactively manage our maturity ladder, and in particular addresses our 2025 and 2026 debt maturities in a measured in prudent manner by harnessing the advantages of the investment-grade ratings, we received last year. 11:44 The new 10-year bonds mature in 2032 when we have no other debt currently maturing. Because the offering closed in early April, its impact is not reflected in our March 31 financial statements or supplemental schedules. However, we have provided the pro forma impact on certain of our metrics and a footnote to supplemental schedules 2B and 2C. In January, we converted the remaining $141 million principal balance of our convertible notes into approximately 6.2 million shares of common stock. 12:17 We also utilized our ATM program during the first quarter to help fund our growth objectives. This included the sale of 2.1 million shares at an average price of just over $41 a share, totaling $85 million of gross proceeds that settled during the quarter. Along with approximately $15 million in additional proceeds from the sale of about 400,000 shares that settled just after quarter end. At the end of the first quarter, our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 6.0 times. This achieves the top of our targeted range of 5.5 times to 6 times and represents a more than one turn reduction from first quarter of last year. We ended the first quarter of 2022, with nearly $1.5 billion of liquidity, including approximately $467 million of cash in the full capacity of our $1 billion revolver available. 13:15 I'll now cover my second topic, which is our investment activities. During the first quarter, we acquired a total of 822 homes for $341 million through several acquisition channels. This included 518 wholly-owned homes for $218 million at an average 5.3% cap rate, as well as 304 homes for $123 million through our joint ventures. During the quarter, we sold 141 wholly-owned homes for $52 million. 13:49 Finally, I'll walk you through my third topic which is our first quarter 2022 financial results. Core FFO per share increased 13.5% year-over-year to $0.40, primarily due to NOI growth in interest expense savings. AFFO per share increased to 11.9% year-over-year to $0.35. Our full-year 2022 guidance remains unchanged from the initial guidance we said in February. 14:16 In conclusion, we're pleased to see this year off to another strong start with fundamentals continuing to favor single-family rental and many people choosing to lease a professionally managed home in a great location. We believe we are well positioned to continue to provide strong financial results while providing the best overall resident experience. 14:33 With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Operator: 14:40 [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: 14:59 Hey, guys, I'll leave the bad debt questions to someone else. But I did want to focus on acquisitions for a second. I think your original forecast was $1.5 billion of balance sheet acquisitions for ’22, that's certainly what we model. I think on a run rate basis you're pretty far off that pace in 1Q. So maybe we can just talk through the cadence of 2Q, 3Q and 4Q. And if you think that $1.5 billion is still the right level to be thinking about?
Ernie Freedman: 15:28 Yeah, Rich. This is Ernie. I'll start and I’ll pass it over to Dallas. I'll remind folks that we’re 50% ahead of our pace of last year. In the first quarter of last year, our total acquisitions were $233 million. This year we came in at close to $350 million. So it's typically seasonal for us Rich. The first quarter is a little bit slower. The fourth quarter and the past has been a little bit slower things really ramp up in the second and the third quarter for us. I'll turn it over to Dallas to provide any more color there.
Dallas Tanner: 15:51 Yeah. Ernie is right. The first quarter is typically a little bit slower out of the gate, because the activity that tends to kind of not occur towards the end of the previous year. The other thing I'd add Rich is, we added close -- a little over 450 new homes into our build of pipeline in the first quarter just under contract. So you're not seeing that come through the numbers as well. So actually pretty happy with where we are kind of early in the year to earnings point. I think we're also seeing really good momentum on the builder side, both in our strategic partnerships with companies like Pulte, and then again in our merchant build program locally. So we're in a good spot. And I think we'll start to see a little bit of that velocity increase quarter-over-quarter.
Rich Hill: 16:35 Got it. And so, maybe just one follow-up question on the revenue side of the equation. And I'm going to ask a sort of a direct question about what the earn and benefit that's building for 23 years. And I'm sorry if you disclosed loss to lease, I didn't hear it, but could you maybe talk through what you think the earn-in. So what's already baked for same-store revenue for 23. And the reason I asked the question is, your new lease spreads are really good, you turnover is relatively low, very low. So it does suggest to me that there is a lot of big same-store revenue already in for ’23, ‘24 and maybe even ‘25. So I just -- above that maybe unpack that a little bit more Ernie as much as possible without putting you in a position where I'm asking you to guide?
Ernie Freedman: 17:21 Well, I'm just glad you are not asking for ‘26 and ‘27 also, right, all the way out to ‘25. Your supposition is correct. Charles did mentioned in his call script that our loss lease continues to run at almost 20%. And importantly, and we've seen some people talked about this and you as well, our renewal rates continue to accelerate for us. We saw a modest acceleration, good acceleration over the first part of the year and certainly, big acceleration over last year. But our renewal rates are not where our new lease rates are and then that's purposeful in terms of, we think is the right thing to do in this environment where we're at. And said another way, that means we are building up a higher loss of leasing price any other residential sector. You might certainly see, with other companies in the single-family sector like us. 17:50 And so it does set us up for a good position in terms of having a longer runway of above trend growth because of that as long as market rates continued to be a strong as they are, we're not seeing anything that would tell us otherwise. So without giving a specific number for ’23, ’24, ‘25. I think it's before thinking about models, it’s right to see that we likely have a long runway of above trend growth because we're comparing against a difficult year from last year rather than the residential space aren't last year others in the residential space have concessions. So going on early last year and so it does set us up for a probably a nice growth profile over the next few years.
Rich Hill: 18:38 Okay. That's helpful. And Ernie, just one quick clarification question. Could you remind me what was recapture lost leases on an annualized basis.
Ernie Freedman: 18:49 Let me make sure I understand that, Rich, we recapture applies to lease.
Rich Hill: 18:53 Yeah. I'm basically saying if you loss leases is 20%, how much of that do you think you can gain in a given year, obviously, you're not going to get a 100% of that because you don't have 100% turnover. So I'm really asking a question of how much of that loss lease can you gain in ‘22, ’23, ’24?
Ernie Freedman: 19:11 Yes. Got it. So about a quarter of our leases are two-year leases, so you won't recaptured on those and again as long as renewal leases continue to stay behind new lease, which is we had in the first quarter and will likely persist for a while here. Certainly it will -- you'd have to discount it even further, I have to do some quick math in my head to get to Rich price, it's probably the recapture rates lower than you would see in multifamily because of the short-term leases in the fact that renewal leases and multifamily are at or exceeding new leases right now. So you'd have to discount that in terms of how much you would see capture this year but that have to do a little bit of math to get back to you.
Rich Hill: 19:45 I understand. Thanks guys.
Ernie Freedman: 19:46 Thanks.
Operator: 19:49 Our next question is from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Derek Johnston: 19:55 Hi, everybody. Thank you. Yes. So just on the turnover, it really seems to hit a new low every quarter. Are you seeing any indications of a return to normal or could this lower level be somewhat of a new normal in a post-pandemic and maybe higher rate environment? And then in that case, would it be safe to assume that the natural rate of occupancy could be higher going forward?
Charles Young: 20:21 Yeah. Great question. This is Charles. We have -- and really proud of how turnover has trended down over the last couple of years, honestly. And even before the pandemic, we were seeing that come down year-over-year. We think a lot of it is around the product to our location, the service we're providing. However, the pandemic has slowed down some of that move out and we guided that we thought we'd be a little higher in turnover in 2022 that has not shown up yet to your point. And we're keeping an eye on it. I don't think it will stay at this level, like we're seeing right now. However, I don't think it's going to go back to where we were previously. It's going to be somewhere between that given that and given our days to re-resident and how we performed in the past, we do think that this is 97.5%, 98% occupancy business if we continue to do what we're supposed to. And so we'll see how turnover goes. Right now, it's holding. I do expect there will be some point of the year might come back a little bit, but it's a seasonal metric anyway and we'll have to see what the Q2 and Q3 has.
Derek Johnston: 21:27 Excellent. Thank you. And then, just quickly on getting the Pathway Homes portfolio going with the 46 acquisitions and aiding aspiring homebuyers in a pretty tight market was encouraging to us. So can you give us some further details on how it works and if you feel it addresses, or alleviates any regulatory touch points in terms of assisting residents?
Dallas Tanner: 21:52 Well, I think it's early in terms of alleviating stress points in terms of the lack of supply we face nationally that's, that's a much bigger issue than any of the programs will either support or sponsor ourselves as we grow the business. I think more importantly, we're really excited about the progress that they've made and getting the product out in acquiring the resident that is looking for that lease with an option to purchase. I do think that we are seeing the marketplace evolve to where the customer does want flexibility and choice. I talked a little bit about that in my opening remarks, there is a cohort of people specifically millennials that are looking for this flexibility and optionality. And in our business, if you look at the way that we structure our leases with some of the ancillary programs or if you look at some of these new ventures we have to things like Pathway. We're trying to design a program that is completely geared towards choice for the consumer. And I think there is a strong sentiment in the marketplace that people are looking for some of these non-traditional methods to ease into a single-family experience whether it be through leasing or through some of these other products. So we're excited is obviously just launched our partners are doing a great job. We're excited to support it. It's a great revenues, it will be a great revenue center for us over time. And I think it's, naturally, where the marketplace is starting to evolve. It's not as one dimensional as it was say 20 or 30 years ago.
Derek Johnston: 23:18 Thanks guys. That's it for me.
Operator: 23:23 Our next question is from Chandni Luthra of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Chandni Luthra: 23:30 Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So in terms of kind of thinking long-term. How do you think about managing homes as a business for basically kind of not your JV partners. So essentially, do you think about third-party property management? And is that something that you could perhaps evaluate down the line?
Dallas Tanner: 23:56 Yeah. We never say never. The one thing as we've looked at the business on itself. It's not a high margin business generally, property management. And I think you really do want to have a strategic view as to why you would do that. Does it help you with your bottom line, right. Can you mitigate costs over some broader subset of homes. I think what we've really been focused on is curating and experience for our customers. That's very specific and that we can repeat across the country, through scale and high touch service. And so for us, if we were to ever entertain that down the road, we would likely want to provide that same level of service. And you could certainly see a world where as our ancillary offerings, expand and some of the other things that we do with the customer, it could be beneficial. But you have to have enough scale to where it really made sense, I think as our current viewpoint on the third-party space. There is only so many hours in the day and we'd love to spend our time making sure that we're driving the best returns possible in our capital.
Chandni Luthra: 24:52 Got it. And then on the Rockpoint Homes I mean, these higher price point homes basically, how is the geography different in kind of even if it's in sort of the same, say, geography is the location differently from your current homes in that these quasi-suburb, close to transportation corridors portfolio that you have. How are these higher price point homes different from that standpoint?
Dallas Tanner: 25:24 It's a great question. One, we've talked about a little bit at Citi and the few of the other conferences, but really, they're meant to be a little bit more infill, a little bit higher price point, you might see a little bit higher end finishes. We own some of this in our portfolio today in parts of the country where maybe you get priced out a certain categories as well. You could take a markets like Seattle that way in terms of having really interesting opportunities to invest and infill locations that maybe the price points are a little bit higher. It also is a nice complement to our partnerships with our builders and the partners in that space, where they have communities that might be talked a little bit more infill at higher price point and segments with which would be well beyond what our average rents are today and so we view it is completely complementary to what we're doing as we've looked at the customer these higher price points of our own portfolio. We see very similar statistics in terms of the types of decisions they make while in our portfolio. And we also know that there is a growing room of preferential that are preferring to lease at these higher price point assets. And so for us, we look at it as a value add really across the chain. And it's not all that different from what we currently own and operate just a little bit higher price points, maybe a little further in.
Chandni Luthra: 26:37 So does that give you any kind of, does it make it harder from a maintenance standpoint.
Dallas Tanner: 26:43 I'm sorry, make it harder. I'm not understanding the question.
Chandni Luthra: 26:47 I guess what I'm asking, Dallas is, given that the location is a bit different does it make harder from maintenance standpoint?
Dallas Tanner: 26:56 No, it’s too early [Multiple Speakers] No. Okay. I'm sorry, I wasn't coming through very clear. No, it's still has all the same characteristics we typically want to try and achieve when acquiring assets, but just could be that it's in a little bit more of a higher price point segment within those kind of geographies, and I'll give you an example that I mentioned on the call. We operate in Phoenix really inside of the major rings, right. The 202s. the 101 freeways, but there are different geographies within some of those sub-markets. South Scottsdale submarket for example would fit great into this higher quality price point where we own plenty of homes in Tempe, which is 5 to 10 minutes away just a little bit further south. So I use that as an example where it might just be a little bit more infill, but still have the same major arterials, similar school scores and things like that it's just a little bit higher price point segment.
Chandni Luthra: 27:50 Got it. Thank you so much.
Dallas Tanner: 27:53 You're welcome.
Operator: 27:56 Our next question is from Nicholas Joseph of Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Joseph: 28:03 Thank you. Ernie, guidance was unchanged, but if you look at the same-store numbers they were ahead of what the full year implies obviously the comps change and we're still early in the year. But how did 1Q trend relative to what guidance assumed and was it more of a company policy decision to wait till the middle of the year or things trending more towards the midpoints?
Ernie Freedman: 28:27 Yeah, Nick. I can tell you with a guidance perspective, we are trending a little bit better in toward the higher end of the ranges, but it wasn't such a significant outperformance. So we felt this early in the year. It made sense for us to provide a guidance update. Typically in the past, we haven't done guidance updates in the first quarter to your point, I won't call it a policy, but just the reality is we just provided guidance about 60, 70 days ago, and this year has been other than a couple nuance things that are kind of offsetting each other has been kind of what we expected it to be. But as I said, we're trending a little bit better than the midpoints but it makes sense at this point we thought to make a material change to guidance where we're at in the years playing out for the most part as we expected at this point.
Nicholas Joseph: 29:12 Thanks. That's helpful. And then can you provide an update to the California lawsuit where it is today and kind of any updates from our conference back in early March?
Dallas Tanner: 29:25 Yeah. Hi, Nick, Dallas. Not a lot to update, but just kind of by way of summary. In late February, we elected to remove the California State Court action to Federal Court so that action, it's now pending in Federal District Court in the Southern District of California. We're currently preparing our motion to dismiss the complaints, which we intend to file shortly. And it's really in accordance with the court's schedule so under that schedule once we do that the plan at this time to respond. We have time to respond to that. And so the deal definitely take us into kind of the middle part of the year. Outside of that, as I've said before, we think we have some pretty compelling arguments and we're just interested. I guess, and having our time in court to go and defend us properly.
Nicholas Joseph: 30:12 Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: 30:14 Thanks.
Ernie Freedman: 30:16 Thanks, Nick.
Operator: 30:17 Our next question is from Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Jeff Spector: 30:24 Great. Thank you. And first, congratulations on the 10-year anniversary.
Charles Young: 30:30 Thank you.
Ernie Freedman: 30:29 Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Spector: 30:32 Question -- absolutely, amazing 10 years. First question I had was just on Charles commented on the website traffic and it seemed like there was some moderation in the new lease rate growth. I guess, can you talk about that a little bit and tie those together?
Charles Young: 30:55 Yeah. So as I mentioned, we're seeing good demand, occupancies maintaining 98%, and then you look across kind of how we've been progressing in Q1, which is typically a slower period each month of newly side, we see an improvement. And so, ending on the newly signed in Q1 of 14.8 is really strong and April has continue to accelerate and will be in the 15s. It's still early, we haven't -- we're not completely close, but we're still seeing good demand going into peak season maintaining that our strong occupancy turnover seems to be holding. So we see nothing but a kind of good upside going into peak season.
Jeff Spector: 31:33 Okay. That's great news. So, April, you're saying -- you're seeing an acceleration into peak and then I guess any particular market color you can add on to that, Charles?
Charles Young: 31:45 Yeah. It's been strong all-around, markets are the kind of typical Phoenix led on the new lease side has been really strong in Q1 to north of 20% almost 23 -- north of 23%, but what's been unique about this market and some of the demand kind of conversations we've had previously around people moving. The Florida markets are really stepping up for us. So, South Florida, is on the new lease side, north of 20% as well, just around 20.9%. We're also seeing Vegas, which is historically been strong, that's still strong at 19%. Atlanta has been holding well, north of 50% and Tampa. So those Florida markets are really kind of the addition to what we've seen in, historically, on the West. And the same thing kind of on the renewal side, Phoenix Vegas, South Florida, Seattle catching up after having some limitations, which is great. And we're happy to see that in Atlanta, Tampa also holding pretty strong on the renewal side. So it's great to see our typical markets that have been performing at kind of the top if you see the Eastern Florida do well is nice as well.
Jeff Spector: 33:02 Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: 33:05 Our next question is from Neil Malkin of Capital One Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: 33:17 Good morning, everyone. Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for the time. I was wondering if you could talk about ancillary revenue. I think previously you mentioned you had a couple of pretty significant initiatives you're working on one being the smart rents systems and things along those lines. Can you just give us an update on how those things are going, if there is any more in the pipeline and what you kind of see as your -- this is an example, 4Q like ’22 quarterly run rate versus ‘19, given the things that you've done over the last couple of years or plan to initiate on?
Charles Young: 34:05 Yeah. Great. Thanks for the question. We're really proud of what we've been able to do on the ancillary side, we had our Investor Day, a couple of years ago, when we said we're going to start to build these programs and infrastructure. We put a team around it. They're fabulous team and they're really executing well. As you mentioned the kind of the hallmark of the ancillary is our Smart Home technology. We have that in all of our available homes. It's well and well over half of our homes and we continue to add every, every month as homes turn. But what we've done there also is launched our video doorbell piece, which is additional revenue as well as convenient for the resident and we're packaging that really in a nice well. So that's going to give us further growth that's going to go into the numbers that Ernie will talk about in a minute. 34:51 The other things that we've worked on this year and last year, going into this year is our pet program, really optimizing what we're doing there as well as thinking about future partnerships. We launched our filter program, which is a win-win in terms of better air quality and energy savings for our residents, but it also keeps the HVAC costs down for us in terms of overall maintenance. We have insurance partnerships. We have a pest partnership with Terminix which is a great partnership as they get our residents get a lower cost than they would find on their own and we get a revenue share with that. We're working on some pilots around utility management and energy as well as landscaping. And landscaping is a big one as we look at it, because this is a lease obligation that our residents need to do, but we can give them a really easy and affordable option that makes it a bit of a turnkey. So those are the hallmark of the programs that we're running in ‘22. 35:51 But as we look forward, we're building partnerships that we think are going to be real win-wins for our residents, as we think about whether it's gym memberships or our convenient food memberships, in terms of thinking about high-speed Internet, which are attractive things to our residents, these are parts of the business that we hope to have a suite of things that we're building over time that's going to help to get to that run rate. I'll give it over to Ernie to talk about kind of where we are the numbers from ancillary perspective.
Ernie Freedman: 36:25 Neil, you referred to 2019, which is backed, I'm guessing to our Investor Day, where we thought we'd be at our annualized run rate of about $15 million to $30 million a year for ancillary items. The team has done a great job to get us ahead of that pace. And we're actually going to deliver somewhere between $40 million and $45 million ancillary income this year on 2022, so ahead of the $30 million annualized number we provided three years ago. And that's going to ramp up here a little bit as we go through the year. So as we get into the, into the fourth quarter to your question and that number for us be closer to say $12 million plus or minus. So that puts us in a good footing for continued growth and that's before any of these new items that the Charles has talked about which should start earning in later this year as well in the next year too. So we continue to see upside from ancillary income opportunities.
Neil Malkin: 37:07 That's great. Really, really helpful. I guess another one from me in terms of pathway and how that's going and maybe how big it could be, or how much of a component of the company, it could be, I think some advertisements for other types of programs, companies that are similar. Wondering, if that impact your view on that I guess market share or a built like addressable market the ability to capture as much as you maybe had thought or maybe impact your view and how much money to allocate to that or to invest in funds in future funds, anything you could talk about on the competitive landscape and how maybe that evolves near term would be great.
Charles Young: 38:05 Yeah. Let's just take a step back for a second and think about what that funnel looks like. So there is call it roughly 170 million households in the U.S., of which about $50 million plus or minus EW in some form of a rental product today, right? and as you think about what I mentioned earlier, around shifting preferences, millennial kind of changes of behavior and the things that we're seeing even in our portfolio with rent to income ratios and things like that. There's definitely a customer out there that's looking for flexibility. rising mortgage rates are probably only adding to some of these decision points for people right now about maybe putting off potential homeownership with, we'll see where rates go, so all lends itself to platforms and companies that can provide choice. I think you're going to carry, really good momentum through kind of different parts of the cycle. So while we're early in our venture down pathways, we're certainly bullish on the prospects of offering choice and maybe a lifecycle for people in terms of the different stages of their lives and what they need and how to suit those needs to best while helping people stay down payment light. I think that's a very kind of important characteristics of the types of things that we want to spend our time on, which is how do we drive overall cost down for the consumer, while creating an experience that looks at deals, maybe close to home ownership. And so we're bullish about where that's going, it's early in the process as we disclosed at the end of the first quarter, we had call it our first 50 homes kind of in that program, partners are learning a lot about the customer and I think we'll continue to see some of these shifting opportunities. 39:43 I think the key thing for us is what do we believe that we can do over time and distance and actually provide value through scale. And we see this as one or two of those kinds of categories, whether it's a rent to own structure, a sale leaseback structure or maybe some of these alternative equity builder programs that are consumer friendly and we're already in the business and it should be an easy thing for us to part with our offerings down the road.
Neil Malkin: 40:08 Okay. Great. And then just a little part B of that exact line maybe -- I know you're probably limited in what you can say that we're on a public call. But do you think that this is also something that helps you almost have an embedded shield toward legislative scrutiny or sort of Twitter headline negative news that you're helping people get into homes. Is that sort of added intangible benefit you guys kind of think about?
Dallas Tanner: 40:40 Well, I think on itself having an array of products available to consumers is just a good thing for the marketplace. We can't really predict where the shifting political wins are going to be or what they're going to focus on that we don't spend a lot of time worrying about that just about running our business the right way and finding ways to solve problems, the consumers are currently facing. So at the end of the day. No, we spend a lot of time thinking about great products, great processes Charles just talked about all the exciting things we're trying to focus on that are going to cure a better experience for the resident. We think the results will speak for themselves. But we're certainly ready to defend what it is that we do which is provide quality product, got a much better price, then you can find in the marketplace today.
Neil Malkin: 41:25 All right. Thank you for all the insights. Great quarter.
Dallas Tanner: 41:30 Thanks.
Operator: 41:33 Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: 41:39 Great. Thanks, everybody. I was wondering if you guys could provide a little bit of detail and context around the 80 basis point increase in bad debt as a percentage, rental revenue and maybe what markets are driving that and is this a concerning trend for you?
Charles Young: 41:54 Yeah. Great question. This is Charles here. Let me step back a little bit, if you think back over our collections bad debt, second half of the year, we were really seeing a nice gradual improvement in all of our markets, including California. And some of our residential peers have talked about this, but going into Q1, we saw that the rental agencies were a little slow on their payments that were outstanding and you couple that with residents who were waiting on those payments and deciding not to pay that kind of hit us in Q1 as a bit of a surprise, especially in February. And so we were really improving at all markets like I said up until December, January is always a little off and then February was a bit of surprise, now the good news is we bounce back some of those payments started to show up in March and in April, we're still a little bit of time left. But we've seen a significant increase, because the payments have shown up, but you also a couple of that with what's going on in California in that April payments and beyond are no longer eligible for rental assistance. And so the psychology effect of that on the resident is they're starting to pay, where they thought they might have a chance to some of them had a chance to wait out for rental assistance. So April is encouraging, as I said, all of the markets are gradually getting back to normal, if you think back to kind of how we thought about the year, we knew the first half would be a little more challenging from a collection of bad debt and we thought that the second half is where we start to catch up. So we don't see it as a major concern, but we're going to keep an eye on it, and we'll see how we progressed with California going forward.
Austin Wurschmidt: 43:40 That's a helpful clarification. And then I'm just curious if there's anything holding you guys back from driving higher turnover. And Ernie, I believe you said it's kind of the renewals you're sending out below new leases is the right thing to do. So should we take that as your self-limiting increases or should we expect and have you assumed that those will continue to increase as we get into the peak leasing season?
Charles Young: 44:08 Yeah. This is Charles. I'll take that one. We've really taken a balanced approach. We believe it's the right approach, given the tenure of our residents, living in a home families, all of that. Also keep in mind that renewals are priced 90 days in advance. And so if you go back over the last year or more every month, we've improved on our renewal pricing. And we will continue to get that as we look out to kind of May and June, we’re asking over 10% on our ask. And you look at our Q1 renewal spreads at 9.7%. As I mentioned on the newly side, we've actually seen more acceleration in April on renewals into the mid-10% range. So we think there will be continued improvement. We'll see how high that goes, but the goal here is to really take a balanced approach and be thoughtful around our resident experience and keep a resident who is good, paying in the home for a long time, a 10% increase is really good. Now we have that loss to lease, and as things turn will capture that. And we're going to keep pushing and improving the renewal rates when we can capture it.
Austin Wurschmidt: 45:18 Very helpful. And then just this last follow-up to that is, can you walk through the puts and takes around the impact that lower turnover has on guidance versus the increase that that you assume for the full year because obviously one hand you're recapturing that much higher new lease rate than what you're achieving on renewals. But on the flip side, you're incurring higher turn costs and perhaps frictional vacancy. So, how do those two kind of balance out and depending on how that plays out.
Ernie Freedman: 45:48 Yeah. In the moment, if we have lower turnover, it's going to have a better impact for our results and that will have higher occupancy, because we have lower downtime from vacant units. And we'll have lower expenses because it will be avoiding turnover costs. And then just really just depends on what the difference is between that renewal rate you're getting in that new lease rate in terms of the long-term earn-in from that. As Charles pointed out as everyone, I'm sure seen our new lease rates have been, have been higher than renewal rates for a period of time. So we think it's the right call from an economics perspective. We think it's the right call in terms of dealing with our residents. 46:23 And for us, as Charles alluded to in the beginning of your questions, where bad debt came in a little bit higher than we would expected at the beginning of the year here in the first quarter. We're more than offsetting that by better rate. We're doing better on the rate side than we expect to both on new lease, as well as on renewals we had high expectations, but we've exceeded those expectations in the first quarter and they continue to trend that way and we've done a little bit better on occupancy as well for the reasons I just described.
Austin Wurschmidt: 46:50 Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator: 46:55 Our next question is from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: 47:05 Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Acquisition cap rates, I noticed they ticked up by about 30 basis points from the low end of third quarter. I'm curious, has competition abated at all or what else would you attribute that change to?
Dallas Tanner: 47:19 Still early to say that there is an argument around rising mortgage rates and creating some new supply. It just comes down to kind of shift mix and what we're seeing in the marketplace. Generally, I wouldn't read too much into it either way, but the early in the year, as I mentioned earlier on the call, there's a little less supply than you typically see. You see the spring and summer seasons, you typically see your supply creep up. We'll keep an eye on it and keep you guys posted, but right now, going in cap rates feel pretty good.
Brad Heffern: 47:50 Okay. Got it. And then on the third-party homebuilder pipeline, I know it went up a few hundred homes for last quarter the ‘22 deliveries went up as well, but I thought the ‘23 went down and then there were 167 cancellations. So I was wondering, if you could just give some color on the puts and takes there?
Ernie Freedman: 48:08 Yeah. In the ‘23 and the cancellations are line up with each other. There was one project that we're moving forward with the builder and as there complete the work on zoning turned out wasn't going to work out for us and that's why the nice things, we like about this program is that there is a flexibility to get locked into something that may not work. So we don't expect cancellations each quarter, but we did happen to have one to canceled and what ‘23 delivery that was the project that enough cancelling on us. We just move forward and as you saw, we grew the pipeline, pretty robustly beyond that.
Brad Heffern: 48:36 Okay. Thank you.
Operator: 48:40 Our next question is from Keegan Carl of Berenberg. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Keegan Carl: 48:49 Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So just kind of going back to acquisitions in the quarter. Could you just walk us through your expected yield please, because if you get back-envelope math 5.6% (ph) stabilized cap rate same-store NOI margin of 70%. Your rents, roughly 30% higher than your existing plan. So just kind of curious what sort of rent growth you're baking in going forward?
Ernie Freedman: 49:10 On new acquisitions?
Keegan Carl: 49:13 Yeah.
Ernie Freedman: 49:14 Well, I think it's safe to say that like in your models, it varies by market and your year one assumptions are going be a little bit more aggressive than your other assumptions. But at the end of the day, kind of mid to high-single digits, probably for your year one is kind of probably your base case and then you just got it, you have to mirror the product with the sub-market and everything else that you're buying, so it can kind of go from there. But you're right in that, those are really healthy cap rates going in considering where rate growth has been and where it's likely going. It could be pretty good yields years two and your three.
Keegan Carl: 49:52 Got it. And then shifting gears here I guess specifically to markets. So if you look at Denver and Seattle, there is no improvement quarter-over-quarter in occupancy. Just curious, is this still function of renovation is taking longer than expected?
Ernie Freedman: 50:08 It's been really a function of two things. One is that we continue to buying those markets and two, as we talked about last quarter, we've made some improvements across many of our markets in terms of being get a rating done a little bit quicker, but there's still some challenges. And with regards to getting the vendors on board, our DCs to help us with that. And those are two markets where we've seen a little bit more challenged, but we're starting to make some good steps and move in the right direction for both of those.
Keegan Carl: 50:33 Got it. And just one final one for me, so insurance expenses were up 5.1% year-over-year same-store. I guess, what should we kind of expect for the balance of the year, given you're supposed to hear about it in March?
Ernie Freedman: 50:45 Yeah. We actually had a pretty flat renewal with regards to our property insurances as the vast majority certain liability lines were low double-digits for the vast majority of the costs coming through on insurance is in the property line. So I think you actually see that get a little bit better as we get through the rest of the year. So we still had the first two months of the year that we're comparing to the prior insurance policy, new insurance policy on the property side, it's flat year-over-year. So I think you'll see some improvement in our year-over-year insurance growth will decline from what you saw in the first quarter.
Keegan Carl: 51:14 Got it. Thanks for your time, guys.
Ernie Freedman: 51:18 Thank you.
Operator: 51:20 Our next question is from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: 51:27 Hi. Thanks for the time. Just wanted to touch on the builder relationships in the contracts there. Could you just remind us how the pricing works when you lock in the prices per homes and how that fluctuates if at all, where changing cost of capital and particularly on the debt side?
Dallas Tanner: 51:49 Yeah. So from a high level, typically what we do is, we'll structure an agreement where we lock in pricing prior to the, obviously the project getting going through zoning in some of those entitlement works Ernie mentioned earlier. And then we have a little bit of some protections built in for both our builder partner and for us. So, in a rising cost environment, we have an out, if things get to a point where we're not comfortable with what that pricing needs to be based on a variety of what I would call kind of open book factors. 52:19 And then on the flip side, if we're able to be costs and a couple of key areas we share in some of those wins in our entry point gets a little bit better. So we try to make these contracts is flexible for us and for our partner as we can. While locking in conviction that we're all in on the opportunity subject to that range in pricing and that range is pretty tight in terms of where final pricing ends up and we've already like, do what you would imagine we underwrote initially to call it a worst case scenario that we like the price, no matter what within that kind of specific range. So far so good, in terms of the majority of how these structures have gone. And then we're reviewing a lot of other projects right now so excited about what the future will hold.
Juan Sanabria: 53:05 Thank you. And then just to follow up on the qui tam issue, recognizing you're confident in what may happen in California going forward, but curious if you've had any indications or of potential investigations are questioning by anybody on those same issues that have been a less than California in other geographies outside of California.
Dallas Tanner: 53:32 No, we have not.
Juan Sanabria: 53:34 Great. Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: 53:36 Thanks.
Operator: 53:40 Our next question is from Dennis McGill of Zelman. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Dennis McGill: 53:46 All right. Thank you, guys. Ernie, can you just remind us what the definition, how you guys calculate loss lease just mathematically with the way you're estimating both the market in the latest rate you're using that?
Ernie Freedman: 53:59 Yeah. So we just take where we see current market rates across our portfolio. It's a little trickier for us than the multifamily space because each of our 2,000 homes is unique, but each month we reprice, a good chunk of those to our renewal process. And so we take a snapshot out of our revenue management system as to where we think market rates are and so we're comparing that market rate number to where our current rents are in our portfolio based on the leases that are in hand, the leases that were signed and people living in those homes since.
Dennis McGill: 54:31 And that would include anyone that just signed at least essentially being mark-to-market? So anybody that wasn't signed in the recent period would obviously be higher than that portfolio average?
Ernie Freedman: 54:42 Yes. And that's why we have a loss to lease. Yes, we're taking the leases in hand as they are for the quarter were they're at compared to where market rates are, so it weren’t certainly weren't certainly an environment now that people are signing leases now are much higher than the ones that were expiring.
Dennis McGill: 54:59 Yeah, that I understand. I'm just saying, obviously that you signed leases in the quarter, and that wasn't period would be mark-to-market and those new leases, does the 20% loss to lease treat those as mark-to-market or exclude those from the comparison?
Ernie Freedman: 55:11 No, because leases in January potentially had some market increases. So we look at all of the leases, Dennis. So, yeah, absolutely we’re looking to the most recent releases.
Dennis McGill: 55:21 Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then going back to just the Rockpoint JV, the new one, previously in the past that it always been I think generally thought of in the industry that higher-priced homes were a little more challenging to get the right yield of a right return, how do you guys think about that as an evolution for you to get to believe you can get the same yield and return on these homes as the lower-priced homes, or is there a different kind of risk reward balance that you're looking at there?
Dallas Tanner: 55:49 Yeah. To be clear, they are a little bit different from a return profile. So I mean, we've been pretty clear about this, we kind of see these homes coming in, in that kind of low 4s to mid-4s from a cap rate perspective. The other key thing here Dennis is, more -- like more expensive product does not equal bigger product that's also an important differentiator. You want to make sure that from an operating perspective, keep your square footages in check, so that you don't get into trouble having bigger homes that cost more to turn and obviously on your rent on a per square foot basis you're going be a little bit more elevated, but from a total yield perspective, from a customer perspective, from an ancillary opt in, kinds of services perspective, we're really intrigued by this customer. And then we're going to look to get a bit smarter in the category through our partnership with Rockpoint hopefully well into the future.
Ernie Freedman: 56:36 To that point, Dennis, it’s one of the reasons why we're doing this in a joint venture because we are in property management fees and asset management fees that help offset the lower initial yield that we expect to get on these, as Dallas described. And then, we also have the opportunity to earn a promote. We think the risk adjusted return on a per home basis is going to be compelling compared to our regular portfolio, but we do recognize that there is probably slightly lower yielding home at the outset, but that's offset by our opportunity to earn fees and actually puts us in a position with the price stronger economics. We might be doing on our balance sheet.
Dennis McGill: 57:07 Yeah. It makes sense. And then, one more quick one for you. Ernie, it looked like there were some movement in swaps during the quarter, maybe taking on a little bit more floating at this point versus before is that just timing or can you maybe just walk through what the impact was of that?
Ernie Freedman: 57:21 Yeah, Dennis. It's exactly timing we priced our bond offering on March 25 and we broke the swap that was associated with the debt. We're going to pay off at that time. So we didn't take any pricing risk or interest rate risk, but we actually didn't close on the bonds until April 5, that's when we receive the cash. And so we get right back to where we were before in terms of basically be a 98%, 99% hedged. We just had over the quarter, it looks like we went down the 92% because we broke the swap before the bond actually closed a few days later.
Dennis McGill: 57:49 Makes sense. Okay. Thanks. Good luck, guys.
Ernie Freedman: 57:53 Thanks.
Operator: 57:55 Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: 58:04 Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Ernie, just wanted to go back and clarify, what was the bad debt assumptions for improvement in bad debt at the start of the year and what does that -- now has that changed at all in light of what's going on in Southern California?
Ernie Freedman: 58:20 Yeah. We ended last year in the fourth quarter at about 1.1% bad debt was what we reported. We thought we'd have a number that was closer to that. We thought it would go up a little bit, as Charles mentioned earlier, you may have heard January tenant and December tenant to be ones that are a little bit more challenge for bad debt versus the rest of the year. So what surprised us was the February activity. So we thought we'd be a little bit higher than 1.1%, but not as high as the 1.8% that we reported. Yeah. Too early to say at this point, hand up our full year expectations for bad debt has changed, as Charles alluded to, what we seem to be getting back on track as we got in the March, as we're seeing in April. I certainly don't want to call year of this early, and if we were surprised in February. I hope it won't be surprised later in the year or maybe will be surprised to the upside. What I will say, as I mentioned early and we are doing better on the rate side and the occupancy side. It's certainly helping offset that. So we, therefore, feel very good about our guidance and don't change what I said earlier that we're trending toward the higher and then of our guidance range, when it comes to us then link revenues.
Haendel St. Juste: 59:15 Got it. Understood, okay. On the whistleblower case going to court, is that going to pressure G&A at all. Are you comfortable with the range still here. Any reason for us to paint that perhaps upper end or maybe a little bit more on the G&A side? Thanks.
Ernie Freedman: 59:31 And Dallas, it’s kind of going into through the process we expect that it's, and you say it's going to court. We have to -- we'll will file our motion to dismiss, but then there'll be some activity that happens beyond that as Dallas described. So we're not seeing anything different at this point that would tell us we need to do anything different with our guidance. We feel very good about with the case, but it's going to be a process, but nothing should be read into that other than we talked about.
Haendel St. Juste: 59:57 Got it. Okay. Thanks. And Dallas maybe one for you here. Certainly, seen a lot in this industry evolve here last 10 years. More recently, though, it seems like the industry you guys earn a bit of defense in terms of the narrative with the oversight the regulations, the messaging lately it appears a bit of a shift hearing more of the -- we're helping to solve the housing need, you have the pathway JV. I guess I'm curious, are you at the point now or maybe the industry will start getting a bit more offensive in the messaging and dictating messaging a bit versus the having someone else to the messaging, which I guess you had a point now where it seems like sometimes the value proposition, the quality, the homes what you're providing often get muffled by all the other chatter going on around us?
Dallas Tanner: 60:46 Yeah. Haendel, I mean we obviously are aware of, kind of shifting narratives that are out there, but they shift. I think that's the key thing. If you go back, we are celebrating our 10 year this month and 10 years ago, the narrative was we were saving housing, companies like ours and that were coming in and we talked about this a little bit at our event, at least have neighbors come up and give us big hugs for fixing dilapidated homes that were in their neighborhood. And now as we're in a period where there is rising housing costs and everybody wants to figure out what's cognizant, there's a lot of times, you just -- the narrative is going to shift I think is the easiest way of saying it like, we're not too focused on the moment, really focused on big picture what is that we do. We buy quality housing. We produce quality housing with our partners and the goal is to create flexibility of choice. So if that's a defensive tone. I guess you could call it that, except that it's really offensive in the sense that we are total conviction around the business model. It's been here forever, no one has done it professionally and we're going to continue to find ways to do it and even better fashion, whether it's through some of these other products and being more maybe be sensitive to the fact that down payment is hard for people to come by. Sure. That just means the industry is evolving and we're happy really to be a participant in that. 62:06 I think we're getting better at talking about what it is that we do beyond just buying great real estate and offering great services. So some of that is the qualitative stuff and it does matter, it's important that is an industry. We get the narrative out there about what it is that we do as companies, but at the end of the day, it's really about just running a great business. The results have, I think spoken for themselves at least in the five years that we've been public. And I think you know us evolving as a company just shows that we're growing. We're finding ways to invest capital in meaningful ways that I think provide other alternatives to people because the lease isn't for everyone necessarily all the time, either. And so we want to explore those avenues and figure out ways to make the company better over time.
Haendel St. Juste: 62:47 Got it. Well, keep up the pipe, you come a long way Thanks for the time.
Dallas Tanner: 62:53 Thanks.
Ernie Freedman: 62:54 Thanks, Haendel.
Operator: 62:58 The next question is from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: 63:05 Hi. Regarding increased traffic to your website. Do you have a sense of who the demographics are, and if they vary from that plus 120,000 to income 39 year old. I guess it's another way of asking, if you see your total addressable market shifting?
Charles Young: 63:18 Yeah. Going through the website traffic. we don't see those specific demographics. But we do see our application traffic come in and that's how we understand the household income as the age. The demographic still look similar 39 years old. Although, on the household income, we're seeing continued increased, we are almost 130,000 household income now with our current rents that puts us in almost 5.5%, 5.4% ratio. Yeah, 5 times plus. And so, really healthy demographic, strong demand as we talked about. What I would clarify is some of that traffic is our existing residents coming back because we're driving traffic there as well as we're looking to try to build the ancillary part of our business. So a little nuance to that piece, but overall we're seeing the same demographic. We also survey our residents that are moving in, it's a smaller survey, but things haven't really changed there significantly about 80% have lived in a single-family before and it's up slightly from prior quarter. And the main reasons that are moving as are looking for space, which is our business and single-family, backyards and extra bedrooms on a price per square foot really affordable and they want to be closer to work. And it just -- it solidifies our business model that we're in the right locations, offering the right products. So we triangulated on all of that information to make sure that we're buying in the right areas, and doing the right things.
Linda Tsai: 64:55 Thanks. And then, is there a way to quantify the cost savings or margin improvement that occurs from mobile maintenance request versus call centers? And then besides reduced turnover, what you see is potential margin drivers going forward?
Ernie Freedman: 65:09 Yeah. It’s the right question and we're tracking that closely. We're seeing that our productivity of our team is higher where they get to more, more work orders each day, because of that, so we haven't reported yet publicly as to what that's meant from a margin increased perspective in terms of our savings will have on personnel and other as well as the maintenance costs. It's the right question as we have more data and we have more backing. We'll certainly be able to provide some more color on that.
Charles Young: 65:34 Yeah. We do have data as we track our customer satisfaction scores that come from that. Our residents clearly like the experience of the mobile app, in terms of you reduce the number of trips as Ernie talked like, that's a quantitative difference that we're seeing at our -- ratings are always high on our work orders in the kind of 4.6, 4.7 maybe higher and we're close to 4.9 on the mobile maintenance app, which is really great.
Linda Tsai: 66:02 Thanks.
Operator: 66:08 The next question is from Alan Peterson of Green Street. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Alan Peterson: 66:14 Hey guys. Thanks for the time. Just wanted to follow up with an additional Rockpoint JV question. I appreciate all the insight you guys have provided so far. Just wanted to see if you could touch on or quantify any differences and how you're thinking about margins between the higher price point homes relative to the rest of the portfolio? And is there any change in terms of the statistics on average length of stay or move-out to buy trends for those higher price point homes?
Ernie Freedman: 66:43 Yeah. We're really compare to Alan is, those types of homes we have in our portfolio today. So from a margin perspective on a like-for-like basis, meaning in the same market. We’ve expect these to have higher margins by couple of hundred basis points because of the higher rent levels that they're going to half because it we expect to ramp it at a similar to maybe just to suddenly increased cost with regards to repairs, maintenance and also have higher taxes, but those down kind of flow through from a valuation perspective. So it's really going to come down to as where the mix of where we buy those homes in terms of where they are, that will be the biggest determinant one overall how that joint venture does from a margin perspective from that perspective. And then, remind me Alan what the second part of the question was?
Alan Peterson: 67:21 In terms of just average length of stay, is it a touch higher or lower relative to the rest of the portfolio or move-out to buy trends are those a touch higher or lower?
Ernie Freedman: 67:31 Yeah. Again for the homes, we have currently in our portfolio they are pretty consistent. We didn't see an immaterial difference depending on the market. Sometimes you see one is a little bit higher, one is a little bit lower than the current portfolio. There is always a much of a difference there. And again I gave us some conviction and certainly the folks Rockpoint is we got excited about the opportunity.
Alan Peterson: 67:49 Thanks. And then, just another question for me. In terms of the amount of capital that's looking for SFR today, obviously, it's come under -- come into the spotlight for some regulators and from local politicians, state politician, but have you noticed any form of legislation or even new policies among homeowner association that is starting to deter your ability to buy new homes within any given market?
Dallas Tanner: 68:18 Not really. I mean occasionally have an issue with an association where maybe they're trying to limit the amount of rentals or have some sort of a seasoning period before somebody could do rentals, but no, nothing, nothing material.
Alan Peterson: 68:32 Perfect. That's it for me. Appreciate it guys.
Dallas Tanner: 68:38 Thank you.
Operator: 68:38 Our final question today is from Jade Ramani of KBW. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Sarah Obaidi: 68:46 Hi. This is Sarah Obaidi on for Jade. Are you facing any supply chain issues impacting the business in terms of ability to execute and complete repairs or renovation?
Charles Young: 68:59 Yeah, nothing material, in terms of supply chain, as we talked about earlier, there is a little bit of inflationary pressure on costs. But in terms of supply chain, we saw early on in the pandemic, there were some issues around appliances, when we had alternate vendors that we could go to that helped that. As Ernie talked about there's a little bit in some of our markets, as we're buying just trying to get GCs, but that's specific to a couple of markets. Other than that, no real major supply chain challenges.
Sarah Obaidi: 69:32 Got it. Thanks for taking my question.
Dallas Tanner: 69:35 Thank you.
Operator: 69:38 We have no further questions, so I'll hand back to our hosts for the closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: 69:46 We want to thank everyone for joining the call and we look forward to seeing everybody at NAREIT in June. Thanks.
Operator: 69:53 This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-16 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and good afternoon and welcome to Invitation Homes Fourth Quarter 2021 Results Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now hand you over to Scott McLaughlin to begin. Scott, please go ahead when you are ready.
Scott McLaughlin: Good morning and welcome. I am here today from Invitation Homes with Dallas Tanner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer; and Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call we may reference our fourth quarter 2021 earnings release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures in yesterday’s earnings release. With that, let me turn the call over to Dallas.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Scott. And good morning to all of you joining us today. In my remarks this morning I’d like to share several thoughts and highlights from this past year, and also take a look at the year ahead. To start we continue to be impressed with the level of demand we’re seeing for high quality housing, the focus is on functional living with the flexibility of a leasing lifestyle. It’s this strong demand that’s helped us maintain our same-store occupancy above 98% for the entire year in 2021, and also taken our average market rents to over $2,000 a month this past quarter. As a result, our core FFO per share increased 16% from the prior year. And thanks to the execution of our teams, we were able to deliver full year 2021 same-store revenue and NOI growth at the high end of our expectations. During 2021, we acquired 4800 homes, which is roughly double our original guidance at the beginning of the year with an average cost basis of over $400,000 and an acquisition cap rate of over 5%. We believe our homebuyers were among the highest quality of those bought by our industry peer group, and accretive to both earnings and NAV. I’d like to mention a few additional highlights from this past year. We achieved three investment grade ratings. We made significant investments in technology, including the introduction of our mobile maintenance app and we continue to work on adding amenities and services that improve our residents experience, such as offering great pricing on pest control and other services by using the value of our size and our scale. We also made great strides with regards to ESG where we improved our disclosures and scoring and launched two big initiatives. First, our step up stand out program in partnership with skills USA which encourages and supports careers in the skilled trades. And second, our Green Spaces Program, which is dedicated to the development and improvement of outdoor community spaces within our markets. So while our teams did an outstanding job in 2021, it’s time to look ahead. Demographics remain solidly in our favor. The leading edge of the millennial generation is now starting to reach our average resident age of 39 years old. In addition, migration trends continue to result in significant household and job shifts to the southeast, southwest and Sunbelt. At the same time, many Americans are showing a preference to lease their home so they can have more space and live in great neighborhoods with improved access to better schools, jobs, and transportation. By contrast, housing supply in the US continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons and those challenges are even more pronounced within our markets. We believe it’s imperative that we play a more significant role in bringing new housing supply to the market, along with helping to provide additional housing solutions around flexibility and choice. Let me offer two examples. The first is our commitment to invest in new housing supply. As you know, we’ve chosen to focus on being the best owner and operator of single family for lease housing. So when it comes to building new product, we believe it’s better to partner with the best home builders rather than competing with them directly in the home building space. Last year, we announced our strategic relationship with Pulte Homes, which amplified our new home acquisition pipeline, and gave us additional strategic opportunities for future growth. In addition to that important relationship, we’re also working with other home builders across the country to help them break ground on new communities where they are strongly needed. At the end of last year, we were under contract on over 1,700 of these new build homes in eight of our existing markets while staying true to our criteria for location and risk adjusted return. We expect to see delivery of these new homes beginning in 2022, and accelerating in future years. The second example involves our commitment to expanding opportunities for choice. Earlier this month, we announced that we’re the lead investor in Pathway homes. Pathway’s mission is to make homeownership more attainable for more families. They do this by working directly with aspiring homeowners to identify and purchase a home, offering them the opportunity to first lease that home with the opportunity to buy it at a future date if they choose. The new venture with Pathway creates additional options for choice. In addition to being the lead investor in Pathway, our partnership offers us the opportunity to broaden our third party property management expertise. Outside of Pathway another way that we’ve helped families achieve their housing goals is through our resident first look program. For all that we’ve identified for sale for strategic reasons, this program offers residents residing in those homes a first opportunity to purchase. Since we started the program in 2016, we sold nearly 250 of these homes to our residents, representing over $60 million in sales, further living out our mission of together with you we make a house a home. That mission marks a big milestone in 2022. On April 11, we’ll celebrate 10 years of providing high quality housing to people choosing to lease a single family home. When we launched this business, a professional home leasing company with coast-to-coast 24 hour customer service, seven days a week did not exist. Invitation almost was at the forefront of creating a new model and change the narrative by offering an innovative concept built on customer demand and favorable demographics. During this past decade, we’re pleased that an important part of that narrative has been our meaningful impact in the communities in which we serve. We’ve invested nearly $2.5 billion in home renovations within our communities. While last year alone, our associates also volunteered more than 13,000 hours of company paid volunteer time to help local organizations they care about within their communities; a practice we strongly encourage. In conclusion, today in the US there are over 125 million households with 90 million single family homes, of which about 17 million are single family rentals. I’m extremely proud of the 80,000 of those within our portfolio where we believe the highest standard of quality location and genuine care for our residents is both expected and delivered. I’d like to close by saying thank you to our teams for 10 years of curating a unique leasing lifestyle, providing a level of service that gives our residents peace of mind and creating strong communities where our residents and our associates can thrive together. With that I’ll pass it on to Charles, our Chief Operating Officer.
Charles Young: Thank you Dallas. Our fourth quarter results helped us finish the year strong. As you mentioned reported same-store revenue growth and NOI growth both at the high end of our guidance ranges. Average occupancy stayed at 98% throughout the year and retention and our resident satisfaction continued their strong highs. We believe we offer the best level of resident service of any single family rental operator and this is reflected in our operating results. Let me walk you through the details. Same-store NOI grew 12.6% in the fourth quarter which brought our full year 2021 same-store NOI growth to 9.4%. Same-store core revenues in the fourth quarter grew 9.5%. This increase was driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 7.1%, 130 basis point improvement year-over-year in bad debt expense and a 53.6% increase in other income net of resident recoveries. Average occupancy of 98.1% in the fourth quarter was consistent with prior year. As a result same-store revenue growth for the full year 2021 was 6.4%. Fourth quarter 2021 same-store core operating expenses continued to come in favorable to our expectations increasing 3.1% year-over-year driven by a 3.1% increase in same-store fixed expense and a 12.6% increase in personnel expense, partially offset by 12.3% decline in turnover expense, net of resident recoveries. Next, I’ll cover our leasing trends in the fourth quarter, which continued to reflect strong demand and favorable market conditions. Our new lease rent growth came in at 17.3% for the quarter, while renewal rent growth was 9%. Together this drove blended rent growth of 11.1% up 630 basis points year-over-year and up 50 basis points over prior quarter. We’re also seeing the strong results continue in January with blended average rent growth of 10.9% up 590 basis points year-over-year and occupancy remained above 98%. As you know, we send our surveys out each quarter to better understand the choices and preferences of our new residents. Let me tell you what we learned this past quarter. About a third of the group chose one of our homes because they wanted more family house seeking above all, a family friendly convenience oriented pet friendly home. Nearly half of our new residents are working from home at least two days a week and 75% plan to continue to work from home after their office reopens. Three quarters of new residents feel safer living in a single family home than an apartment because of the additional space and privacy a single family home provides. Surveying our new residents when they move in is really just the beginning of our listening process. With our pro care services, we help keep our residents’ home in good working order by performing proactive maintenance twice a year. And with the mobile maintenance app that Dallas mentioned earlier, we make communication between our residents and our service teams more convenient and efficient. These are just a few of the many ways we help to make our residents experience more worry free. We may not have invented the leasing lifestyle, but we are certainly working every day to improve while creating a resonant experience that is second to none. I’m excited by the strong momentum our teams continue to maintain as we start the New Year. I’ll now turn the call over to Ernie, our Chief Financial Officer.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today I will discuss the following three topics; one balance sheet and capital markets activity, two financial results for the fourth quarter and three our 2022 guidance in main drivers. Let’s start with balance sheet and capital markets activity. Our efforts toward improving the balance sheet didn’t stop after achieving our investment grade ratings in April. In November, we closed our second public bond offering totaling $1 billion. The transaction further improved our weighted average years to maturity to 5.6 years as of yearend, and our percentage of homes that are unencumbered to 63.2%. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio at the end of 2021 was more than a full turn lower than at year end 2020 finishing 2021 at 6.2 times, not too far off from our targeted level of 5.5 to 6 times. We finished 2021 with $1.6 billion of liquidity, including $600 million of cash and the full capacity of our $1 billion revolver available. For the year we issued almost $2 billion of unsecured debt to pay down secured debt with an average maturity of almost 10 years in an average coupon of 2.36%. During the fourth quarter, we issued approximately 4.1 million shares of stock at an average price of $41.63 through our ATM program. Total gross proceeds of $169 million were primarily used for acquisitions. In December, we launched a new ATM program, providing us $1.25 billion of capacity that has not yet been used. Subsequent to year end in January, we completed settling conversions of our remaining 2022 convertible notes with 6.2 million shares of common stock. Next, I will go through our fourth quarter 2021 financial results. Core FFO and AFFO per share for the fourth quarter increased 19.7% and 21.0% year-over-year to $0.39 and $0.33 respectively. Our full year core FFO and AFFO per share were $1.49 and $1.28 respectively. This represents year-over-year growth of 16.2% and 18.8% respectively, which was primarily driven by higher NOI and lower cash interest expense. The last thing I will cover is 2022 guidance. As Dallas and Charles outlined, we finished 2021 with tremendous results and we believe that favor ruble supply and demand fundamentals will remain a strong growth catalyst for us again in 2022. Starting with same-store revenue growth, occupancy is anticipated to remain elevated in 2022 in line or slightly lower than 2021 results. Despite a tough comp, our guidance ranges assumes a similar blended rent growth in 2022 as in 2021. It also assumes that bad debt expense improves on 2021 levels, but not yet returning to our pre-pandemic historical average. Taking those assumptions into account we expect same-store core revenue growth of 8% to 9% for the full year 2022. Turning to same-store expense growth, our guidance range for 2022 is expense growth of 5.5% to 6.5%. Our same-store expense growth for each of the last two years has been under 1%. We expect higher expense growth in 2022 due to real estate tax growth, reverting to closer to 5%, inflationary pressures on repairs and maintenance, turnover and personnel costs and a higher turnover rate. That being said, we were pleased to beat our expense growth expectations last year, and we’ll work hard to do our best again this year. This brings our expectation for 2022 same-store NOI growth to a range of 9% to 10.5%. With regards to Dallas’s comments earlier on the pipeline of new homes we’re acquiring from various home builders. Note that we expect these homes to be a more meaningful contributor to growth in 2022 and beyond. You may have seen that we have included new disclosure around our anticipated delivery of these homes, which can be found on schedule 8-B of our supplemental filing. With everything considered, we are expecting full year 2022 core FFO share to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.70 and full year 2022 AFFO per share in the range of $1.38 to $1.46. A bridge of our 2021 core FFO per share to the midpoint of our 2022 core FFO per share guidance can be found in yesterday’s earnings release. I will wrap up with a reminder of our announcement earlier this month that our board has increased our quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share a 29.4% increase over prior year. In conclusion, it’s not just favorable industry fundamentals that are helping us succeed. It’s also our differentiated strategy that’s built upon our locations, our scale and our local eyes and markets. So whether it’s through our growth, our execution or our industry expertise, we believe we have a strong competitive advantage to continue to achieve favorable results. With that Operator, we’re ready to open the line, please for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Anthony Paolone from JP Morgan. Tony, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Anthony Paolone: Great, thanks and good morning. My first question is on the regulatory risk and regulatory environment. Can you talk about what dialogue if any, you have with the regulator’s what the hot buttons may be and anything you envision changing in the business going forward on that front?
Dallas Tanner: Hi, it’s Dallas. First off, thanks for the question. From time to time, we’ll get inquiries from regulators, we’ve disclosed that we’ve been working with the FTC to help them understand our business in a broad sense, but not really any change there and aren’t seeing anything necessarily that suggests a change in the business environment. I think the big focus right now is around rental rate growth across residential generally. Our multifamily peers are coming out, I think with pretty big growth rates as well this year. So I think just that inflationary pressure tends to be more the headline versus necessarily anything on the regulatory front.
Anthony Paolone: And then in your guidance, we can probably back into this, maybe if you’d help us. What do you assume market rent growth to be over the course of 2022 in order to maintain rent spreads that you laid out?
Ernie Freedman: Yes, I think Tony important is, you have to look at it between renewal spreads, as well as new lease spreads. And I know a lot of people pointed out I think you have as well we have a pretty big embedded loss to lease in our portfolio that’s in the high teens, if not close to 20%, you can certainly see in our activity during 2021 and new lease numbers far exceeded renewals. As said in another way that’s probably going to give us a longer period of time over in probably more stability in our renewal increases and as Charles talked about in his call script and we got numbers in the renewables in the 9% range, we’d imagine, there’s the opportunity for that to be pretty steady throughout 2022. With a little bit harder predicted the new lease rates, but remember, Tony renewals are 75% to 80% of our business. So the new lease rates certainly impactful but not as impactful on the renewables, as Charles talked about -- still see an extraordinarily high new lease rates 14% plus in January, but we do expect that that will moderate as year goes through. But when you look at that on an overall basis, we think it’s pretty consistently numbers that are very similar to where we ended up in 2021, which is about a 9% blended growth rate. That’s because renewal being the majority of that not seeing a lot of volatility in that result throughout the year.
Anthony Paolone: If I could sneak one more and just what do you have assumed in terms of just acquisitions over the course of 2022 in your guidance?
Ernie Freedman: Sure, absolutely. And as you can see in our schedule at the builder contributions, pretty small in 2022. If you look at our guidance range, we’re assuming about $2 billion acquisition activity during 2022, about a billion and a half of that would be on the balance sheet, about 400 million of that would be closing out the Rock Point joint venture we expect to have that closed out sometime during the second or third quarter in terms of being fully committed and invested. And then separate from that with a Pathways opportunity, we expect it should be plus or minus about $100 million that will invest in Pathways of our $250 million commitment there. And importantly, Tony, and I saw some people pointed this out this morning, we started the year with a larger cash balance, and we typically wouldn’t kind of got ahead of our needs from a capital perspective as we finished up the fourth quarter. And so when you factor in about billion five of balance sheet activity, we’ve got $600 million of cash sitting on the balance sheet today to help fund that. We do expect this position activity of between $300 million and $400 million in 2022. So slightly elevated from where we were in 2021. And then, of course, you have your free cash flow. Our dividend payout ratio, even with our large dividend increases on the lower side for REITs at about 60%, 65%. With those things taken into account that we’ll find the vast majority of the $1.5 billion, we’re able to -- balance sheet activity, but we certainly will need some capital for us to get all the way there with some combination of debt and equity potentially during years depending on what would be more efficient across capitalist for us to use as we try to achieve that number that’s very similar to we did here in 2021.
Operator: The next question is from Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Jeff, please go ahead.
Jeff Spector: Great, thank you, good morning. My first question is on migration trends. Everyone’s laser focused on some of the comments you discussed, Sunbelt population shifts jobs. I guess anything new to share that you’re seeing, let’s say January into February. Any other trends you could share with us from your data?
Charles Young: Great. This is Charles, great question. I shared some of it in my prepared remarks. Honestly, there’s really nothing new than what we’ve seen in prior quarters. We’ve got about 83% are coming from single family prior, meaning that they know what they’re looking for. And as we talked to them, maybe this wasn’t in the prepared remarks. But the two main reasons they’re looking to move to, is to get more space or to be closer to work, which speaks to our locations, where we own our homes. We do see that about 60% are coming from out of town, that’s a combination of different cities or from out of state. And as I’ve talked about previously, we were given a pandemic, seeing a number of people move from the northeast to the southeast, specifically Florida, and you can see it in our numbers. Our new lease rank, relative demand is really high in Florida, Atlanta as well. We’re seeing Vegas with some real high demand. People moving out of California, Texas, as well. So these are some of the migration trends, but things have been pretty consistent over the last few quarters in terms of the demographics. We do also ask if we get a little deeper on around what are they looking for in terms of the community types and it’s the family friendly, kids schools, pet friendly, convenience oriented, that’s really our portfolio and that’s why you’re seeing such high occupancy and great demand within our homes.
Jeff Spector: Thanks, Charles. And then thank you for the new schedule 8-B. I guess two questions there. First on South Florida just kind of stands out that nothing is delivering in 2023 or beyond, anything particular in South Florida to note?
Ernie Freedman: I’m sorry Dallas, with that one, we have a specific contract with someone today and over deliver most of those in 2022, and look for future opportunities there to expand that further and 23 or 24. But that’s actually one of the first ones up in the Q1 22 for delivery for us, versus specific projects that we’re working on with them. But that’s a different builder.
Jeff Spector: Thank you. And actually, my last question, if I could just ask on the expense growth Ernie, just to confirm the 6% midpoint range are you seeing most of that is estimates for higher real estate taxes?
Ernie Freedman: Yes, good question. Jeff, as I mentioned, the prepared remarks the last two years our expense growth has been at 1% or less, it’s been pretty extraordinary. So I think it’s a combination of a few things. And you point out the biggest one, Jeff, and that real estate taxes are about 60% of our expenses and baked into our guidance, there’s an expectation of about 5% increase in real estate taxes. We’re going to aim to do better than that, if we can have some good news on some appeals and things like that, maybe we can come in a little bit, that’s certainly going to be a big driver. And then the other big driver, they’re just being the inflationary environment we’re in with regards to repairs and maintenance costs in turn costs. And then finally, you asked on the numbers, our turnovers came in again, extraordinarily low here in the fourth quarter, and for the full year at 22.9%. We are assuming the turnover goes up a little bit from that about 23% number to something more in the 24% to 25% range. So not only do the inflationary pressure of labor in supplies, but also baked into our guidance are more terms. Now, to be fair, we sort of thought that was going to start to happen in 2021 and it didn’t. So you’re hard to predict for certain that will happen. But that is what’s embedded in our range of the 5.5 to 6.5 expense growth.
Jeff Spector: Okay, thanks and congratulations on a great 21.
Operator: The next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad your line is open, please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Thanks, good morning everyone. On Pathway, I’m curious what you consider thinking about doing that model yourself. And then is there any scale that you can give to the key potential there?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. We’re really excited about this partnership and maybe just level setting for a second. We talked about this a little bit in the release, but we have an ability with people that are leaving our portfolio and seeking homeownership to also help bridge some of that gap as this program develops over time. I think your question is a good one, which is why not do this per se yourself. I think out of the gates, what we’d like to do is get smarter around the product, deal with partners that we trust, and that we’ve worked with in the past. And I think Pathways offers us that kind of perfect opportunity. I would expect that as if we like the programs over time and distance, we’ll be able to also extend those programs, buy a Pathway or whatever alternatives are in the marketplace. But I think helping people along the housing continuum and in their journey is something that our company and our people are passionate about. So the investment in Pathways is reflective of that, and we’re excited to see what sort of fruit it can yield in the future.
Brad Heffern: And then any new color on where rental income ratios have trended recently?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, great question. We’ve been continuing to see upward kind of movement on that rent income ratio. We’re over 120,000, on the average household income, which is very healthy. And with our rents around 2,000 a month, we ended up at a five to two ratio, which what I would say is one of the strongest in the residential sector. So it’s a testament to our location, demand that we’re seeing, and our team is doing a really good job with screening as well.
Operator: The next question is from Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick, please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. As we’ve seen, the increasing amount of capital that’s been earmarked to the single family rental space, where do you see the most change in direct competition, I don’t know either from a quote channel or geography or something else?
Dallas Tanner: Hi Nick, Dallas. We’re certainly still hearing a lot of the build for rent narrative out there. And that’s starting to take shape across two or three different categories. You really have garden style apartments that are starting to pop up in suburbs that are much smaller square footages. We certainly have partnerships with companies like we have with Paulte and other builders, where we’re building single family detached product that is generally geared towards for lease product. And then you’re seeing kind of a hybrid, where guys are doing stuff infill on a townhouse basis. But it feels like a lot of the capital coming in is more sophisticated or at least wanting to come in as more sophisticated you’re hearing really kind of insurance companies, sovereigns, pension funds, looking for ways to deploy capital, as we’re having conversations. I think the challenge is largely around kind of a couple of areas of why that’s not as easy. One, you got to have a great platform, which we all know is difficult to build in. And replicate is similar as what we have here at Invitation Homes and I think the second piece of it is which markets and why where’s your thesis and do you have kind of sound logic, but I’m hearing the same things, I think you are Nick, which is there’s a lot of capital that wants exposure to single family in similar ways that they’ve had exposure to multifamily over the years.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. That was Michael speaking here with Nick. Does that alter your views on perhaps growing a much larger asset management program and sort of ventures to take advantage one of all this capitals out there and appears maybe lower return than what you’re willing, and then layering in your operating platform and the management of it, you can try to juice the overall enterprise? Is that an active process for you today?
Dallas Tanner: It’s certainly something we’ve gotten a bit smarter out over the last year with a Rock Point venture. Michael, I think you’re touching on kind of key things that are important to us. One, you take a step back absolute shareholder return is our focus. So we do want to do things that allow accretive growth to the portfolio or the platform that has complete upside for shareholders. And the Rock Point venture for us was a way that we could obviously insulate some of the risk for whatever reason, our cost of capital wasn’t in a position to grow as quickly as we wanted to. But there’s also different slugs, there’s probably some different opportunities overtime as we get a bit more sophisticated and how to think about JV businesses overtime and distance that we could do things at our discretion that are very accretive to the platform to shareholder. So I think we’ll continue to be opportunistic. I think that capital coming into the space obviously lends itself to future thinking around some of that. And it can also be price point driven, geographic, I think there’s some things that you could think of outside the box where we could take less shareholder risk, in terms of how to look at markets or opportunities, but drive a ton of value to the platform and actually use the synergies and the efficiencies of the platform to create exceptional returns. So it’s something we’ll certainly look at overtime and distance.
Unidentified Analyst: And then the second topic, Charles, you talked a little bit about surveying the new residents that are coming in and you made a comment that about half of those are working from home two days a week and 75% intend to work from home in the future, even with their offices open. I guess what is that new renter, what is that representative of the total portfolio? How representative do you think it is? I don’t think you’re serving all 80,000 homes right now. It’s only that new park. And maybe you can just I don’t know, if there was some geographical impact? Or can you just sort of tease out a little bit more of those comments?
Charles Young: Yes. No that’s great question. Just to be clear, we’re serving new residents who moved in that quarter. So you have a good question. But it’s hard to tease out what you’re asking for, given that we’re really just trying to capture those who are moving in, and kind of what’s their general sentiment at the time, but having looked at it over last few quarters, or last year through COVID it really hasn’t changed that much. As I said, high 40, almost 50% are working from home some part of the time. And the other thing we got from it is about 73% are thinking that single family home gives them that safer environment that they’re looking for their families, for their pet. And so we can try to pull out that information in the future. But right now, we can’t go as deep as you’re asking us.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, I just didn’t want to jump to a conclusion based on a smaller sample set. It was certainly a bigger headline, an eye catching headline, I just want to put it into context relative to the size of your portfolio and all the geographies that you’re in just to try to understand it better, which we can do at a later time. Appreciate it. See you in a few weeks.
Operator: Next question is from Keegan Carl from Berenberg. Keegan your line is open.
Keegan Carl: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the questions. First, I think this one’s a little more challenging to answer. But I’m just curious, you guys have any broader thoughts at home price appreciation looks like this year? Do you have any sort of internal forecasts for rates and the impact it’s going to have on the housing market?
Dallas Tanner: This is Dallas. We would all be in different professions, if we could have predicted what’s happened over the last 24 months in terms of home pricing. So I agree with your sentiment that it is very, very difficult to predict. And obviously, it’s interest rate sensitive. I would say this, as we looked at just the case sheller across our marketplaces, we’re somewhere around 23% on a look back basis. Now I can remember three or four years ago when we look back and that number was closer to 6% or 7%. And then I can think about 10 years ago, when we started the business when we were looking back at that number and it was between 12% and 13%. So the momentum or the inertia of where kind of mean, median pricing in a market is going is impacted by a variety of factors. I said this, this morning in some media we were doing but we don’t expect trees to continue to grow to the sky forever. But with that being said, all the things Charles just laid out around desirability people wanting maybe a little bit more space, people wanting a yard I do think living a couple of years like this now, with these types of things influencing our decisions are likely here to stay longer than they are to go away. And so I do think that pressure around housing prices continues. I think the supply challenges are so much bigger than what we just talked about around months of inventory. This is at a very municipal level, zoning and an implementation level to really course correct and be able to create ease of supply to come into the marketplace. So we would expect home prices to generally stay elevated given that interest rates are by and large, still really low, even though they’re going to creep up if you look at it on a relative basis. When I bought my first home in 2003, I was paying 6%. Today that rate is somewhere in the high three. So it’s still really, really cheap money for somebody that wants to go and acquire a home. I think the key thing is, within municipalities and at the state level to be pro development in some of these markets. That’s going to solve some of the appreciation issues that people are calling attention to.
Keegan Carl: Got it. I guess this one’s more for Ernie, but just any sort of commentary the use around insurance renewal rates and what they could look like in March.
Ernie Freedman: Yes, good question. We’re actually just going through our renewal right now and because we’ve had such very good loss history and insurers understand the spread of the risk for us as much different from a catastrophic event. If you think about our homes in Florida, certainly Charles and Dallas have to build scale. But scaling our business is a lot different than having one or two large commercial buildings or residential buildings that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. We’re expecting an insurance renewal that’s going to be generally flattish, maybe up 1% or 2% but we’ve gotten good feedback from the market and the share hopefully wrapped up here in the next few weeks. So insurance will be a good guy for us to believe relative to our other inflationary pressures we’re seeing on expenses.
Keegan Carl: Yes. No, certainly it’s good to hear. Just want to clarify one thing I know this was mentioned a little bit in the beginning on regulatory. Did you guys mention anything about the FTC investigation or any sort of update on that?
Ernie Freedman: No, no update there. They’re just that we’ve acknowledged that we’re working with the FTC to answer any questions that they have around the company or the industry that the inquiry is pretty broad, and we’re doing our best to make sure we get them the information they need.
Keegan Carl: Got it. Thanks for the time, guys. Really appreciate it. 
Operator: The next question is from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Jade please go ahead.
Jade Rahmani: Thank you very much. As a follow on to the FTC question, could you give a broader update on the regulatory and political environment both respect to rental housing overall, and if there’s anything you’re hearing in single family rental in particular, just around the affordability question and rent growth?
Ernie Freedman: Yes happy to Jade. And by and large, we’ve continued to keep you guys and everyone for that matter updated with inquiries and questions that we’ve got from state, local or federal inquiries overtime. We’ve worked over the last several quarters, with the house congressional subcommittee on the Corona virus to give them a bunch of information, as have many companies within our industry, we’ve done that. Also across the Senate Banking and Finance Committee, as we’ve had inquiries from Senator Warren and others, we’ll continue to do that. Its best practices, also how we’ve been for 10 plus years in terms of making our information available to those that have inquiry. And by and large, one of the benefits of being public is our information is generally available on what’s going on with the industry. I think at the local levels where you’re hearing kind of some of the noise and the pressure really does center around rate discussion. The cost of goods generally, will evolve felted across different categories and sectors is going up. And we just talked about it with home price appreciation, our cost of materials and flooring and paint and all that will also have some of that creep as well overtime. I think Charles and the team have done a phenomenal job, if you look at our expense creep the last two years of keeping that locked in and using our platform and our pricing power to be as effective as we can. But it’s just an environment that creates a heightened sense of awareness and costs. And so I think some of that Jade feeds into the public narrative. And again, we said this every two to four years, we’re in another election cycle and unfortunately, some of this starts to become the headlines. We’ll do our best to continue to take the same approach we always have, which is work with any and all parties that objectively want to dig in and understand what’s going on in single family. We are a very small, small percentage, but a good barometer of what we’re seeing across the space. And so we’ll share that information freely. And outside that Jade, we haven’t had really anything new beyond what we’ve kind of been addressing over the past several years.
Jade Rahmani: And is there anything from the feedback you’re receiving or your sense of the environment that is causing any operational changes? One of your peers, for example, has some limits on the rent bumps that they will take. And some concessions they provide as partial offsets to rent growth. Are there any practical operational implications to the way you’re running the business?
Ernie Freedman: Yes I mean, to be clear, and we talked about this on the last earnings call, we’ve done a considerable amount of rent adjustments, rent forgiveness, and worked with folks through the last couple of years in the tens of millions of dollars, in terms of how Charles has run that program. Going forward with obviously working with all the different rental assistance providers to make sure that we’re erring on even the side of caution, and making sure we’re working with customers and Charles has done a spectacular job. I think we’re close to $50 million. Charles, we’ve secured in rental assistance over the last two years on behalf of almost 8,000 cases with our residents. So the team has done an exceptional job, I don’t think we’re going to change anything that we do outside of following state and local laws around how to operate property management businesses and how to think about the way that you issue new renewals. I think the headline there, also Jade is that we have a lot of embedded loss to lease on the renewal side of our business. So we do look at where our renewal assets are going out. We modify and make sure that we’re being sensitive to market and kind of current market environment. You see that in our numbers, our new lease numbers are substantially higher than our renewal numbers. And so we think that actually has a good long term tailwind for the business overtime.
Operator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski from Green Street. John, your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Thanks a lot for the time. I was curious to get your thoughts on them pretty wide disparity we’re seeing in private market pricing on portfolios versus one offs. And so is there an opportunity to kind of reposition the portfolio more in a step change fashion, take advantage of portfolio premium prevailing right now?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. It’s a great question, John and you’re seeing similar things, really more so last year, I felt like we saw a few portfolios traded really high premiums on a relative basis to whether we were we thought maybe our cost of capital was or what we would consider call it end user retail pricing. That appeal, we’re seeing less of those opportunities going out. So yes, it is part of our asset management practice, we’re constantly looking at parts of our portfolio where we think could we drive a premium. And you might be able to argue that our California portfolio has pretty high values to it. But again, it’s also got the Prop-13 protections, it’s got a really steady tenant base. And there’s a lot of upside in terms of a risk adjusted return profile. So anytime we look at our portfolio itself, we don’t rely analysis. We have a discussion around where we have conviction and why and so you’ll see us continue to call and turn and look for opportunities. I don’t think there’s an opportunity, necessarily in the near term that’s immediate or wholesale that would take us off course, from what we’re doing currently. But it’s certainly something that we do as a matter of best practice internally.
John Pawlowski: Maybe just one follow up on the acquisition side as you’re underwriting, even small and mid-sized portfolios. Could you help quantify portfolios, you’ve looked at what a typical spread is and a cap rate basis on the portfolio versus if you had to assemble that portfolio on a one-off?
Ernie Freedman: Yes, it just depends by market. I mean, we saw some trades last year in Sunbelt, in southeast markets that we’re trading, what I would say on an in place cap rate, kind of in the high threes. You might be able to buy those assets, one by one at a five cap today, or high fours. And again, your cap rate will compress the more you buy, because there’s just sort of limited opportunities out there. But those deltas can swing pretty widely, and it’s based on the product and how big the deal is. I think you’re highlighting an important point, it goes to the one that Michael talked about earlier, which is with the balance sheet, we’re going to be really careful. We want to do things that are creative, we want to do things that make sense and are buying 4,000 or 5,000 homes a year one-off is extremely accretive for us. So we’ll continue down that path. I think, to be aggressive on some of those other portfolios you have to look at other slugs of capital over time, and you have to have conviction that you believe in the assumptions. And those are the things that we look at when we looked at those opportunities, John.
John Pawlowski: Alright, appreciate the time.
Operator: The next question is from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Haendel your line is open. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you, thank you, good morning. I guess the question, I think you guys mentioned earlier that you expect to extinguish the remaining capital from the Rock Point JV this year. So I guess I’m curious how you thought maybe about potentially expanding it or maybe adding a new JV partner here. So I’m curious how you’re thinking about JV capital and how it might play a role or not in your term? Thanks.
Ernie Freedman: Yes, I already mentioned that the initial Rock Point venture will likely be finished in the second or third quarter. And we view that that buying would then go back on the balance sheet and be additionally accretive growth for the REIT. I think I mentioned it earlier, we want, we’re thinking outside the box are there markets, are there sub markets within our markets at different price points that can be accretive with outside capital, where the platform could benefit on that over time and distance. I think, Haendel, we are spending time trying to get smarter around what that approach could be without confusing our core business, which is to continue to buy accretively for our shareholders. So I think anything that we can look at with, outside JV partners, or maybe long call it core ventures could be interesting over time, you got to find the right type of capital, you got to think about what those price points are, why they make sense. And you don’t want to do anything that distracts you from what you do day to day. So just being smart about the opportunities, the geographies, the price points, and making sure that the story is really clean, and that we don’t compete against ourselves. And at the end of the day, we have a really good generally good cost of capital. We have an infrastructure that supports really good shareholder growth. So we want to make sure that we maximize that over time on anything that we will look at outside of investing on balance sheet.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it, thank you. And a follow up on Pathway I guess. Can you talk a bit more about the pace of capital deployment? It sounds like you’re expecting half of that to be deployed, have the 250 this year and maybe a bit more on the scope of fees and invest returns and trying to understand how this might impact the numbers earnings going forward? Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: Yes Haendel, very happy to address that. And part of it also, in terms of how fast they’ll deploy in the Pathway home announcement, they’re also looking for additional capital, not just ours. So right now we’re the lead investor, but they’re out seeking additional capital. So during this period of time where we’re the only investor any homes that they’re firing is purely from our capital. But there’s certainly enough potential later in the year that other investors will be added to, which would then proportionately reduce what our capital requirement will be during the year. That’s the best way to think about this Haendel is that they’re buying homes very similar to what we’re doing on our balance sheet today, in terms of stabilized deals made, maybe even slightly higher. And then the difference here is they’re doing the work around sourcing the homes, sourcing the customer. So the Pathway homes operating company, which we’re an investor in, is being paid an asset management fee. And then we’re paying the property management fee on running the homes like we do with our current portfolio. So where you can really see some really good leverage for us with regards to having a really nice return here is if additional capital comes in. So earnings management fees, not just have our own capital, but also someone else’s capital is too. So a lot of it’s going to be the base case, it looks pretty good if it’s just our capital, but it gets really nice if we can start bringing in other people’s capital as well and really blow that platform, then, of course, we would our investment in the operating company as well, there’s potentially a valuation on that operating company that could certainly be beneficial to us in the future to get it.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. That’s helpful, Dallas if I could just, one more, and this is regarding I’m going to guess, understanding and it’s always a sensitive matter. But anything you can share a comment on the whistleblower lawsuit in California that was in the press yesterday?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, happy to share what I can. We don’t really comment on, pending legal and whistleblower is not really a fair term. What we had was the city saying that our general contractors were pulling permits, on rehabs and as a matter of practice, this is kind of the only comment I’ll make on this. Because I want to let make your mark and our legal team can deal with this the appropriate way. As a matter of practice, in our contracts with our general contractors, much like you would expect they’re required to pull appropriate permits with the city. So again, when these things come up from time to time, we typically make sure that our lawyers look and review. And then we point municipalities to the proper direction of where the issue actually lies. And so outside of that Haendel, I can’t really comment on pending legal but just know, as a matter of practice for our business, in our contracts with our GC, they are required to pull appropriate permits.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it, thank you. Appreciate the color.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian [Indiscernible] of Evercore. Brian, your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: On the supply side, are you seeing any bottlenecks currently affecting you and your building partners? And how do you see that trending during the year?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, we’re not seeing any real direct bottlenecks given the structure of our homes. When we buy a new home, about 10% of the purchase price goes into the rehab. So it’s in that 30,000 to 40,000 range, mostly paint carpet and all that. So early on, we saw a little bit of noise late in the middle of last year. But today, not really, I think most of it is coming just on the kind of labor side and sourcing GC. We’ve had a really good healthy buy acquisition year. And from an ops perspective, we’re doing a good job of catching up. But there’s a little bit of catch up and to keep up with what we’re trying to do this year. So it’s really just to make sure that we are making an streamline for GC to work with us. And we’re doing a lot of things on that front in terms of make it easy for them to be paid quickly, supporting them, writing quick scopes and all that. And so really haven’t seen much on the material side, it’s mostly on making sure that we’re sourcing the right GC who are going to turn the house around and from our requirements.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. And then just on the ancillary income side, real quick. You’ve talked about reaching that stabilized goal of 15 million to 30 million by the end of this year. Just want to check, if any, any changes to the timing, there’s that’s still kind of the target goal?
Dallas Tanner: We’re at the high end of that guidance that we gave a few years ago, really being driven by seven areas and through the pandemic, we’re able to maintain and keep real good momentum on the ancillary growth. We’ve built a really nice team over there. And from an OS perspective, it’s really rolling out nicely. Main focus has been on smart home optimizing that program, as well as introducing video doorbells this year, pet programs are going well. Our filter program that we were rolled out about a year and a half ago, insurance, a partnership with Terminix on [Indiscernible] utility partnerships, and then starting to work on landscape stuff. That’s really the base case, that’s going to get it to the high end of that guidance that we gave. And we think that continues to grow from there. As we go. Ernie, if you want to add anything, sorry to cut you off.
Ernie Freedman: No, no, you nailed it. All good. 
Operator: Next question is from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Dennis, please go ahead.
Dennis McGill: Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. First one, I guess just looking at the Texas markets, if we were to take 21 as the reference point, both rent growth and occupancy is among the lowest in the portfolio and migration data are away people are talking about migration, that narrative would kind of lead you to the opposite conclusion. So just curious from your perspective, I know Texas looks good versus history, but relative to other markets, and relative to the migration narrative, why aren’t numbers better there?
Dallas Tanner: Well, let me start off by saying we love Texas, we were able to acquire the beginnings of that footprint in our merger with calling Starwood and we’re trying to grow it, Dennis, quite frankly, I think some of the dislocation that you see in the numbers has more to do with the size of the sample some of the existing assets that it does the market as a whole to be fair. We are in our homebuilder program, really trying to target Texas growth, the fundamentals are off the charts, feels like the net migration patterns which have gone on here for 20 years are only going to get better. So we’re bullish, like extremely bullish. And we would expect, we saw this a little bit to if you remember back when Charlotte was a smaller market for us, the Carolinas, we struggled to see kind of the growth rates and the trends. And as we were able to scale up and provide services that candidly a better level, you started to see the acceleration and you start to get better at the pre leasing and your loss, the lease comes down and you actually start to see better programs within your renewal categories. So I don’t want to say it’s a nothing birder, it’s something that we focus on, but it will adjust and change overtime as we get the right product in the portfolio. I don’t know, Charles, if you want to add anything?
Charles Young: Yes, no, I think it’s a good call, out size does matter long term very, very bullish. And if you look at this specific trends within the market, Houston in Q4 was 97/7 occupancy, same as it was last year, which is still really healthy. And today, our ending January -- was 72 versus 28 Q4 of 2020. So while it’s not keeping up with some of the Florida and Vegas and Phoenix, which are just extraordinary numbers, these are good numbers for Houston and Dallas, we saw a little bit of turnover spike in Q4 which brought our occupancy down to 968 in the quarter. But January’s already up to 97. And we’re increasing in the blended rate growth with 99.6 in Q4. So that’s really healthy up from 3.7 before and in January, we’re still in that 8% blend. So, given seasonality, given occupancy, we think this is going to I think the numbers in Texas will continue to be healthy. And overtime, I’ll start to compete with some of the other migration markets we talked about.
Dennis McGill: Okay. Thanks. That’s helpful. And then a little bit separately, do you have, how much of your leases are month to month, and how that’s shifted over the last year or two years?
Charles Young: Yes, month to month is I think about 3.5% of our portfolio today. And it shifted a little bit some of that is the California effect when you have a limit on the renewal leases, and they’re kind of matching up to what would be our month to month rate, some of our residents out there decide to go month to month and that’s what’s pushed it up. Otherwise, it’s pretty typical to what we’ve seen in a small part of the portfolio.
Dennis McGill: Great. And then just one last one on the development pipeline of 1,700 homes, maybe just a little more detail on the asset types or all of those single family detached or percentage would be true single family detached and then are these typically hold communities or partial communities any additional detail there?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. No happy to it and bear with me because I’ll give you a few bullet points here. You know, I think we just close it we’ve got plus or minus about 1,700 homes in contract that are you know in play right now that will start to take deliveries on later this year. We have another two or 300 homes right now that are pretty close to contracts. So call it 2,000 that are kind of in our ultimate pipeline. Their majority of these are single family detached Dennis, we are going to experiment a little bit with some townhome product in much more infill locations, which we bought in the past to be clear. We’ve done some of this back in the early days and also picked up some of this along the way, but it’s really location driven. And we believe that on a margin basis, some of this can be pretty accretive. We think kind of going in cap rates right now are kind of in the low to mid fives. So really accretive in terms of where we think we take delivery. And then about 80% of what we’ve got in our current pipeline is kind of largely Sunbelt and Southeast markets. So we’re going to expect that to continue to insulate that narrative around Texas, and the Southeast, and where we’re seeing some of the highest growth. And we’re also trying to get smart around new markets. We’ve talked about markets in the past that we’d like to be in markets like Salt Lake, and Austin and San Antonio, are all really interesting for us. And we want to continue to try to see if there’s accretive ways to ultimately as a business, maybe be in some of those markets, and the network of built rent providers will continue to expand. John Gibson, and Peter DiLello on our team do a really good job of spending time with a number of different builders and they’re looking at 1000s of opportunities, over a three to five year horizon. So we’re excited about where we are, what we laid out a couple of quarter quarters ago, in my opinion is working, we haven’t taken the majority of these deliveries, but we’re doing things with tried and true partners. And building these on like the right foundations that are built on trust, transparency and an initiative to candidly bring more leasing supply into the marketplace, and I think we’re going to do it, like we’re going to do a good job of it as well.
Dennis McGill: Now, so you’re experimenting at all with that sort of ultra high density product beyond?
Dallas Tanner: No, because at the end of the day, no, I think because at the end of the day Dennis, our customer wants an 1,800 to 2,400 square foot home at about $2,000 a month where it blends, and that ultra high density tends to be a little bit more amenity based, I would never rule out the never. But those start to tend to get to be smaller product. It’s a little different customer not saying it’s a bad customer. It’s a little different from the customer that we have the state of this now almost three to four years and wants, the ancillary businesses and the things that Charles talked about. So I’d actually expect this maybe in some ways to go the opposite way continue to do what we do really well, and drive additional services into the platform and make everything mobile to where a customer can adjust kind of what’s part of that experience from their phone over time and distance, I think that will lend itself to great growth for the business beyond just the real estate and being location focused with our investments.
Dennis McGill: Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Good luck.
Operator: The next question is from Sam Choe from Credit Suisse. Sam please go ahead. 
Sam Choe: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just since we’re talking about acquisition pipeline, again, just wanted to know what percentage of the current pipeline is from Paulte? I think you guys threw around a number like 1500 last quarter.
Dallas Tanner: If you look on schedule stuff, we’ll know to add, the vast majority of that is from Paulte probably 80%m 90% of us fail. But in terms of what’s going to happen in 2022, in terms of we actually intend to buy very little comes from Poulte. Poulte really doesn’t start to kick into gear for us until 2023. And then the vast majority of it seen in supplemental schedule AD comes through in 2024. And as we do more deals with Poulte I think you’ll continue to 24 build out as well, you’ll start seeing 25 and 26.
Sam Choe: Right, and that’s where the 7500 homes kick in, right? So after 23. That’s the five year period where you guys expect that relationship will build and you guys will eventually try to get to the 7500. Is it the correct way to think about it. 
Dallas Tanner: Yes, and we announced the relationship here about two quarters ago. And so, over the five years that will certainly get us into 20 26 million to early 2027. And because we’re getting involved with policies really at the beginning of the process with regards to when we’re thinking about acquiring the land when they have acquired the land. So certainly from there takes the certainly a couple years to get the land ready for the developments to start to happen. So that’s why you’ll see a lot of the stuff deliver in the out years for us. It takes into account the fact and the same number of homes in terms of what the growth rate will be and ultimately other than crewing appropriately for outperformance. If we’re so fortunate to have that later in the year, I think you’ll see kind of a steady growth with regards to the cost associated personnel and then just overall for expenses Sam, real estate taxes you take your best guess at the end year how it’s going to go. And then again you’d put that increase through pretty evenly throughout the year. And then as you get more information, you tweak those accruals. So I would expect you to see and again, profit with property taxes being 60% of our expenses, you’ll see a, we would expect a relatively smoother expense growth in 2022 with regards to where it’s at, and maybe we’ll get some slightly easier comps until we get the second half of the year around repairs and maintenance and turnover, things like that, because the inflationary environment really started to kick into gear for us here towards the end of 2021.
Sam Choe: Got it, guys. That’s really helpful. One more from me. I guess the total occupancy for Seattle and Denver were kind of low compared to the rest of the portfolio at like 91 and 87. What was going on during that quarter?
Charles Young: Yes. Just quickly on Seattle, what’s standing out there is there was a freeze on the renewal side of the business that the Washington had in place. And when we could start to move rents back to market and we did that in a very thoughtful way some residents decided to move out. So it created a little bit of a spike in turnover. And so that’s why you see occupancy went down to 971 was still very healthy from 985. But it’s already rising up in January, we’re at 976 and you’re going to see the renewal rank growth and rent growth go higher.
Dallas Tanner: So Sam, I know you were talking about the total portfolio, not same store. And so on total portfolio the activity we’ve had a significant amount of acquisitions in both of those markets. And so what’s happening is we’re acquiring homes and Charles talked about a little bit earlier, we did see some labor supply shortages in the fourth quarter of 2021, with our general contractors. And with this, the quick ramp up and acquisition activity in the second half of the year, we did see it taking us longer to get our initial renovations done. And we’ve been very acquisitive in both the Denver and Seattle market. So what you’re just seeing there, it’s taking about 30 to 45 days longer than historically, to get homes ready. And that’s impacting our occupancy. We would expect that to work itself out over the year, actually the first half of 2022 to get to more normalized total portfolio numbers.
Sam Choe: Got it. Appreciate the color guys and congrats on the great quarter. 
Operator: The next question is from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc. Austin, please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks, everybody. Wanted to circle back on the pathway investment really quickly, just to better understand it. So is the $250 million investment, your total commitment or just an upfront investment that could grow from here over time? And then second are you structuring these deals, essentially, to ensure you achieve your targeted return? And then any upside from home price appreciation over the term of the rental period is enjoyed by the resident, just any detail you could provide would be helpful?
Ernie Freedman: Yes Austin this Ernie, and Dallas may chime in as well. With the first part of your question, we committed $250 million to the platform, we funded 25 million of that to the operating company, the group is actually they set up an operating company to source the customers and source homes. And our capital partners have also put some cash into that entity as well. And we own 15% of that entity. And then the remaining $225 million is committed to the property funds, where were the homes will actually be owned. And there will be leveraged that will be used there as well and then the hope is that in Pathway homes, folks that are around trying to raise additional capital there to grow that even further. And then from return perspective, we would expect return one stabilizing and they stabilize very quickly because they’ve been someone’s moving in right away. There’s a very light renovation apps on these homes because the current consumer, the residents can pick out the home. It’s the home that they want to potentially buy after a period of time, we expect the yields at the property level would be similar or slightly better. But the least clearly states with what the renewal rates will be over the period of time that they’re leasing and pre negotiates with the purchase prices will be. So if you do see some outsize home price appreciation that will certainly accrue to the benefit of the resident, but that’s all factored into the lease that’s put in place to get together with that resident.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. That’s really helpful Ernie, thank you for that. And then just secondly, back on the regulatory side, I guess, how do you let a lay investor concerns about the regulatory backdrop and outstanding class action lawsuits that came up, which presumably, are on everyone’s mind and come up frequently in conversations, and then maybe bigger picture. Do you think any of these risk release derail the opportunities set for Invitation’s ability to continue gaining scale or on the internal growth profile looking forward?
Dallas Tanner: Let me address first the class action references. We’ve been dealing with for several years in. And there are two claims, but they stem from the same case, the first one was dismissed across all states, but they kept the California piece. Our general counsel is working with that there, we don’t comment on anything ongoing. But this has taken some time, just a case that’s been going on for a while. The second one is the old plaintiff, after the case have been dismissed filing in the state of Maryland. So no new news there outside the fact that these things do arise from time to time. And it’s in regards to a late fee claim and our counsel is working through it. In terms of the broader environment, I think I’ll go back to what I said earlier, which is, there is a heightened sense of awareness with warehousing costs and supply constraints currently live. And we’re all filling, we’re filling in our own choices around housing, whether it’s to buy a home, and the home price is up 25% than it was a year ago, or whether it’s in a lease like a market like Phoenix, where we’re seeing new lease growth in the 20 percentile during the peak months. We can’t solve the overall supply issue for the country. And our shared remarks at the beginning, we do try to make sure that people understand we represent a very, very small subset of the forward lease single family rentals, housing space, and we’re part of a broader sector and an industry that’s evolving and getting better. I think the narrative will be that people will continue to invest in SFR, because they like the returns. It’s never been an institutional asset class. But there’s been somewhere between 15 million and 18 million people that have rented this type of product forever. And so we’re happy and proud of the small part we play in that story. Our goal will be to continue to find ways to accretively grow our portfolio, but not just the portfolio, but the services we provide to the residents. I cannot tell you whether the regulatory environment goes up goes down, it tends to follow political cycles and spectrums and stories that are out there. Right now you have a high cost of housing, reality that we’re all dealing with. So it will get picked on a little bit from time to time. At the end of the day, we were part of an industry has been around forever. And I think we can continue to find ways to make it better than how it was before. And so that’s really our focus is how do we take an industry that’s been here for 200 years, and make it better. And I think you see with our Pathways announcement, those are areas and quite candidly opportunities for renters or potential owners to ease into homeownership in a way that is less obtrusive. And that you can also cap the way that your rate growth on your rent might be while you’re considering whether you want to own this home or not. So we’re fully supportive as a business and industry and a company. And we talk about this all the time, we are all about choice. We think the consumer ultimately deserves choice, two thirds of the country is going to own something, a third of the country is going to lease something in that category around lease we want to be as active as participants we can and we want to take current practices and make them better. And that’s ultimately the view of Invitation Homes and some of these other opportunities that we’re going to continue to look and try to invest in.
Austin Wurschmidt: That’s helpful. Appreciate the thoughts and lastly, Ernie in the 2 billion of acquisitions, how much accretion is embedded in guidance? 
Ernie Freedman: Well, I’ll let you use your, sorry about that Austin. We would expect them to be able to buy environments similar to where we are right now. And 5% plus cap rate range, and you can layer in your own assumptions and around what you think your cost data or work or equity may be traded.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. Sounds good. Thanks, guys.
Operator: The next question is from Neil Malkin from Capital One. Neil please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the time. Glad to be on with all of you, look forward to continuing to cover you guys. I guess first one is going back to acquisitions. The announcement about the Zillow offers unwinding their portfolio looking at some of those houses that they have on their, on the website, I don’t know if that’s the entirety of their inventory, but a lot of their properties seem to match up with your markets pretty significantly in a meaningful way, infill locations, kind of square footage, etc. Particularly in some of the markets you’ve talked about such as growing in Texas, Nashville you’d want to look back into getting into you found the right inventory. There’s several 100 houses in each of these markets. Have you been looking at those? Do you think that’s going to be a larger part of your investment activity this year? And would that be a good way to sort of increase your exposure or get a quicker sort of foothold in markets you’re wanting to grow in?
Dallas Tanner: It’s a great question. And as you look at and I’ll tell you this year, in or 2021, we only bought 126 homes thrive our channels. So it’s not a material amount for us in terms of how we look at growth, we definitely look at those channels. And the headlines always sound good to your point that there’s a lot of crossover. When you start to get underneath the hood on markets, neighborhoods, HOAs the amount of refurbishment that might be needed. And again, I go back to the fact that we’re pretty stingy investor. We were really particular about where we invest capital and why. And we wanted to line up with our strategy around the resident experience. So we didn’t tend to see a lot of opportunities, particularly on the Zillow side of things. We certainly looked. And we’d be crazy if we didn’t, but there’s price, there’s location, there’s 10 finish standards, there’s things that we hold ourselves to is we want to continue to build out our brand and the way that we do business. So while we would welcome any opportunity to buy from my buyers, if that made sense, we just haven’t lined up on a lot of trades this year. That’s the answer kind of playing a short.
Neil Malkin: Yes, makes sense. In terms of the platform, you guys have obviously been leading the way in terms of institutionalizing and sort of making that model more efficient. A lot of the apartment peers have really been focused on sort of like what you call next gen, or putting technology and the resident experience more to the forefront. Obviously, your portfolio is different than a high rise apartment building. But can you maybe just elaborate on things that you’re doing beyond the sort of 15 million to 20 million of other revenue increases? You talked about achieving? Can you just talk about how you see technology or the operating portfolio maturation along with technology impacting the business in terms of potential margins over like a three year period.
Charles Young: Yes, great question. This is Charles. Innovation is kind of at the core of what we’ve been trying to do in this industry, obviously professionalizing, the single family business and being able to introduce technology that’s been our base of how we kind of deal with and manage 80,000 homes across 16 markets. Early on, we were early adopter in the smart home technology that did a lot towards that. And we’re still trying to evolve that side of the business that allowed us to do self shows, and allow the residents to control the thermostat and safety by introducing video doorbells, I think we’re going to be able to do more on that front in terms of making it even more convenient and safer for our residents to tour the homes. One of the innovations that we introduced this year or 2021 was around our maintenance mobile app which has been really helpful. We’ve had about 30% adoption of our work orders are coming through the maintenance mobile app. It’s on both Apple and Android and almost over 60,000 downloads. Well, we find what that is that the resident, it’s really meeting them on how they want to operate with us. It’s very convenient. Our satisfaction scores are higher when people go through the mobile app. We’re getting lower number of multiple trips. So these are the types of things that make the resident experience better and makes us more efficient. And we’ll continue to do that. You brought up the ancillary site. I think there is huge improvements there. As we survey our residents, we constantly ask them, What are you looking for, what’s going to make it more convenient for you whether it’s moving services that we can talk about, it’s the broadband services, handyman services, these are things that we are experimenting with, we’ll be piloting and then rolling out and that innovation is really going to be led by what’s going to be that leasing lifestyle that our residents want, and that we know it’s going to make us more operationally efficient. And to your point, pull in those margins, if you will, not everything that we’ve done in the history of the company as we’ve expanded and been able to get more and more efficient in our operating environment.
Neil Malkin: Great. Sounds like you have a lot of things in the hopper. That’s all I had. Thank you very much. Great quarter. Look forward to continuing to work with you guys. 
Operator: Final question today is a follow up from Nick Joseph from Citi. Nick please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: It’s Michael, appreciate you guys sticking around. I just wanted to come back to sort of the last release, which we talked about being 20%. Obviously that’s grown through the years you’ve had very strong market rate growth and you haven’t been able to push the renewal for strong. And I was wondering if you can just step back and just talk about your renewal process in the markets that don’t have caps on rent increases? Are you imposing a self imposed cap on those increases? And how do you think you’re going to be able to get at this 20% which arguably, should have continued rent growth within everything that we’ve talked about, from a fundamental standpoint, that 20% just going to grow larger by the end of the year. So how do you sort of put this all together given some of the regulatory constraints that are going around?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, it’s a good question. Short answer is there’s no hard cap. We’re really just trying to be thoughtful around how we go out with our renewals. We’re seeing what’s happening on the new lease side, obviously, we’ve had a really good numbers, even through the January numbers that are really healthy in the mid teens. But what you will notice on the renewal side, it’s increased every month, over the last year, and we’re continuing to see that acceleration. And I think over time, we’ll get back to capturing some of that spread that we’re losing in the loss to lease, but how we do that practically on the ground is we perceive what we think is that market rate and we then go and give that to the field teams, and we look at it house by house market by market and trying to be thoughtful. And if there really is a high push that you start adding $400, $500, then we need to be thoughtful around what we do there, we may pull it back. But we’re starting to see that we’re able to capture more and more of that, because our residents are also seeing what the new lease side is looking right out there. And they’re seeing that this has value in our renewal numbers that we’re giving them. And so over time, we’re just trying to be thoughtful that we will continue to push that up. And if you look at our January numbers, our renewal numbers are at 9.6, where we were on the renewal side 93 in December. And that’s continued to accelerate as we look at February. So I expect it will continue to push up on a renewal side. And we’ll find out where it goes over time. We’ll find that balance. But we are very proud of our teams in how thoughtful they’ve been to try to make sure that we’re creating a right experience and not spiking turnover as well and putting people out into a tough environment.
Unidentified Analyst: Right. Do you have a sense and you quote that 20%? How much of that attainable if you were just taken off the market? How much regulatory issues could there be in markets where you can’t lift the rent to that extent? Right. So if you looked at it on a adjusted basis, what would that upside be? To what you actually put -- exactly the reasons. Yes.
Ernie Freedman: Yes. That’s the key Michael is we’re not going to do it, even though we could do it legally and virtually every one of our markets, California would certainly be the exception around what we can do there. St. Paul recently passed rent control legislation in the fall of 2021. Minneapolis has a very specific cap of 3%. Minneapolis now allows for rent control, but they have not enacted what they’re going to choose there. The vast majority of our portfolio we could do what you’re seeing the multifamily guys do, I suppose to start with our fourth quarter numbers that are January numbers where there are no rates are close or new lease rates. But it shows that we’ve made a conscious effort in our business, our resin stay with us three for almost five years when you see our turnover at 20%. A little bit different than the multifamily business in so we’re not going to capture it. It’s not unlikely we’re going to capture that full loss to lease in one year. Now on the flip side, that should allow for less earnings volatility going forward, because if market rates stay where they’re at, and to your point, they probably continue to grow a little bit. It certainly gives us a longer path we otherwise might see for what we can do for renewal increase over the next many years and still have our residents under market. So it’s kind of a win-win for residents where they’ve been with us for a long time. And it’s certainly an 8% or 9% or 10% increase is a big increase. But it’s not where the market rate is. So we’re playing that balancing act. And it’s not so much from certainly where there’s regulatory pressures. We’re following those 100%. But it’s really just we think it’s the right way to run the business right now.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks Ernie. I appreciate you guys sticking around. Thanks. 
Operator: This concludes today’s Q&A session. So I will hand back the call to Dallas for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: We appreciate everyone’s support and in participating in our quarterly call. We look forward to speaking with everyone next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s call. Thank you very much for your attendance .You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-28 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to Invitation Homes Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Scott McLaughlin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Scott, please go ahead.
Scott McLaughlin: Good morning and welcome. Joining me today from Invitation Homes are Dallas Tanner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer. During this call, we may reference our third quarter 2021 earnings press release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements, relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures to the extent available without unreasonable effort in our earnings release and supplemental information, which are also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Dallas.
Dallas Tanner: Good morning. I’m pleased you could join us as we share our thoughts on the past quarter and the prospects for our company as we look ahead. To start, we had another outstanding quarter of great results. We also continue to find ways to invest capital and generate accretive external growth. I’m particularly proud of our associates, who once again, delivered a resident experience with the genuine care that has become synonymous with our brand. Our ability to develop loyalty with our residents has helped drive strong outcomes for our stockholders. On top of all of this, we believe that the operating fundamentals for our business remain fantastic and that the environment for growth remains favorable with our opportunities to creatively deploy new capital among the best we’ve seen in recent years. I’d like to discuss these points with you in a bit more detail, starting with the strength of the operating fundamentals. As we’ve reported, our average occupancy remains at historically high levels. Turnover continues to trend lower and our rental rate growth continues to accelerate well past our traditional summer leasing window. As the market continues to demand more single-family rental product, we believe a primary driver of the elevated demand is demographics. I’ve spoken previously about the population surge of millennials and how we expect many within this cohort to transition into single family homes over time. They desire more space for raising a family in a room for a home office, and they want better access to good schools, jobs, and amenities. They also value the convenience of a worry-free subscription-based lifestyle. We believe we’re well positioned to continue capturing on these trends. In contrast with this surge in demand is a shortage of housing supply, which we expect will continue in our markets, given supply chain constraints, policy restrictions, and the time required to deliver new supply. We therefore believe single family homes located in infill neighborhoods in high growth markets where supply and demand fundamentals are the most favorable will remain highly attractive investments throughout most real estate cycles. With this favorable backdrop and fundamentals, we believe the growth environment for us to invest meaningful capital remains very strong. We surpassed our original $1 billion acquisition target for the full year back in August. And we had our strongest acquisition quarter in many years during the third quarter with nearly 1,700 new additions to the portfolio. As a result of our improved pace of acquisitions and a better home resale environment, we increased our acquisition guidance last month to between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion for the full year. With our average acquisition cap rate of 5% this past quarter in excess of our implied cap rate, we believe we are deploying capital at yields greater than our cost of capital. This is because rents have kept pace in our markets. As home prices have continued to appreciate and are focused on infill locations as well, differentiated from most new entrance into the space. To pursue these opportunities, we have a multi-channel acquisition strategy. As a reminder, we’re always channel agnostic and location specific. And most of our channels in the third quarter were open and active and remain so today. The environment for one-off acquisitions is particularly strong right now, especially for the product we’re targeting, which are well-located homes primarily in our West Coast and Sunbelt markets. In addition, we continue to lean in on our best-in-class home builder network to help bring additional new supply to the marketplace. We’ve bought several hundred new homes directly from builders so far this year representing nearly 20% of our wholly-owned acquisitions. These do not yet include any homes from our previously announced strategic relationship with Pulte Homes for which now we’re under contract or have agreed to terms on over 1,500 homes. The first of these Pulte Homes are expected to deliver towards the end of next year with our target of over 7,500 new homes coming in over a five-year period. We are excited to have such a strong pipeline of new homes across a diverse network of home builders without the higher risk burdens of being a developer ourselves. Before I close, I’d like to offer an update on our sustainability efforts. Earlier this month, we achieved an over 13% increase in our GRESB score from 2020 to 2021, which compares favorably to the average GRESB participant who saw no change in their score year-over-year you’ll recall last year that we were one of the first REITs to add an ESG component to our credit facility. So as a result of our increased GRESB score, we’ll realize a one basis point improvement on pricing on our revolving line of credit. These are pragmatic steps we are taking while leading sustainability is an important part of our long-term success. And we’re proud to be moving in the right direction while recognizing we can continue to do more. Lastly, I really want to say thank you to our team, whether you’re demonstrating our core values directly with our residents or sharing them from our corporate offices. You’re the driving force behind the value we create for both residents and stockholders. And I thank you sincerely for your dedication to our mission. With that, I’ll turn it over to Charles, our Chief Operating Officer to provide more detail on our operating results.
Charles Young: Thanks Dallas. All of our efforts to create a seamless and easy leasing experience for our residents have resulted in another outstanding quarter operationally. My thanks to all of our associates for making us the premier choice in home leasing. For our same-store portfolio NOI growth accelerated to 11.9% year-over-year, same store revenues grew 7.9% driven by strong rental rate and other income growth. While same store expenses increased a modest 0.6%, mostly attributable to lower turnover and repair maintenance costs. The combination of lower turnover and lower days to be resident continues to drive record high occupancy. Same-store average occupancy has remained above 98% every month so far in 2021 and came in at 98.1% for the third quarter. Our new lease rent growth was 18.4% for the quarter while renewal rent growth was 7.8%. Together, this drove blended rent growth of 10.6% of 660 basis points year-over-year. Reminder that last year, our blender rent growth was 4% for the third quarter 2020, despite the challenges from the pandemic. So our comp to last year is a very healthy one. At the same time, our turnover rate declined 110 basis points year-over-year. This puts our trailing four quarter turnover rate at only 23.8%, the lowest in our history and another strong testament to our resident satisfaction. We also continued to make progress with our bad debt, which at 1% of gross rental revenues was half of what it was for the third quarter of 2020. And important part of this improvement is due to the outstanding efforts of our team who work closely with our residents to find solutions, to keep them in their homes. Since the pandemic began, we have helped thousands of residents apply for rental assistance programs. And as a result, we have received to-date over $25 million in rental assistance payments for the benefit of our residents. Our teams continue to work with those who need help with their claims. By and large, our resident base is strong and stable. Our average new resident today is a family with at least one child and one pet. The adults are on average 39 years old, both work and together earn over $120,000 per year, which equates to an income to rent ratio of over five times. As strong as we’ve seen, we believe our markets locations and quality of homes are driving this higher end customer, along with the worry-free leasing lifestyle and best-in-class service that we provide in our residents expect. In summary, we believe we stand in a great position to finish the year strong and we’ll remain focused on continuing to execute in the last couple of months. With that, I’ll pass it along to Ernie, our Chief Financial Officer.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today, I will cover the following topics, balance sheet and capital markets activity, financial results for the third quarter and updated 2021 guidance. We took a number of steps during the third quarter to support our external growth in further improve our balance sheet. To start, we closed our first public unsecured bond offering of $650 million in August. Bonds have a 2% coupon and mature in August 2031. We used the proceeds to voluntarily prepay our highest cost classes of securitizations certificates that were due to reach final maturity over the next five years. During the quarter, we issued approximately 17.5 million shares generating over $693 million of net proceeds through both our ATM program and the primary offering that was completed in late September. In October, we sold another 1.875 million shares pursuant to the underwriter’s option to purchase additional shares generating additional net proceeds of $75 million. The proceeds from the issuance were and will be used primarily for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. As previously announced in July, we gave notice of our intent to settle our 3.5% convertible notes due January 15, 2022 with common stock. As of September 30, 2021, $199 million of principal was converted into approximately 8.7 million shares of common stock at the election of the note holders leaving approximately 6.4 million shares to be distributed no later than January 2022. Including the impact of these third quarter activities, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined to 6.2 times. Looking forward, we will continue to focus on balancing our growth objectives with our goal of reaching a 5.5 to 6 times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Moving on to our third quarter financial results. Core FFO was $0.38 per share, 27% higher than last year. And AFFO was $0.32 per share, 32.7% higher than last year. This was largely due to outside NOI growth and interest savings. One point I want to underscore from Charles’s remarks is the widening spread between our new lease and renewal rent rate growth. As you can see in our results, our new lease rates, which are predicated on current market conditions are significantly higher than our renewal rates. This is leading to a loss to lease as much higher than we have historically seen. Renewals represent about three-fourths of our leasing activity and the loss to lease on those renewals is much higher than the loss to lease associated with new leases. We believe this could position us favorably for rent growth in the next 12 months and beyond. Last thing I will cover in our update is 2021 guidance. Given our year-to-date results, we are increasing our full year 2021 same-store NOI growth guidance to a range of 8.5% to 9.5%. At the midpoint, this is a 200 basis point increase from our previous guidance. This increase is driven by same-store core revenue growth expectations of 6.25% to 6.5%, which has improved from the previous guidance of 5.5% at the midpoint. Our new guidance is also favorable for same-store core expense growth. We now anticipate growth from a range of 1% to 2%, 150 basis points favorable from our previous guidance midpoint. We’re also raising our full year 2021 core FFO per share guidance up $0.05 at the midpoint to $1.49. And our 2021 AFFO per share guidance up $0.04 at the midpoint to $1.28. In closing, we’re experiencing continued high demand for our product, proving that the desire for flexibility and choice in the housing market remains strong. We are proud of the work we do to help individuals and families who want to enjoy leasing lifestyle. We will continue raising the bar as the best in the business for both our residents and our stockholders. With that, let’s open up the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have on the phone lines comes from Richard Hill of Morgan Stanley. So Richard, please go ahead when you’re ready.
Richard Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. Ernie, I wanted to maybe start with you. First of all, just a quick question on the 4Q implied guide. It looks like expenses are up fairly significantly recognize revenue and NOI are up as well. I know in the past you’ve talked about expenses being higher in the second half of the year, but maybe you can unpack that just a little bit more for us. So I can better understand it. I guess we were expecting expenses to be higher in 3Q and where they came in. So I’m just wondering if there’s actually upside and that, that expense – implied expense guide.
Ernie Freedman: Yes. Well, unfortunately Richard one area I’ve been wrong all year, so we’d love to be wrong also in the fourth quarter with regards to where our implied guidance is, but with some areas we do think we’ll have some pressure on relative to what we’ve seen in the first three quarters are potentially a little bit higher, but growth rate for property taxes we’ve seen so far this year is we had some really good results coming through on refunds in the first part of the year, including the third quarter. We do – baked into the guidance, although again, turnover keeps going in the opposite direction. We are assuming turnover kind of stabilizes or maybe slightly higher in the fourth quarter, but we haven’t seen that yet this year. So certainly, there’s some opportunity for upside performance there, personally, you saw in the third quarter ratio, the personnel costs did increase year-over-year. We expect that to also hold into the fourth quarter, if some of that is just due to the outperformance we’ve had this year and we’re making sure that bonus accruals are where they need to be from that perspective. So we certainly hope that we cannot perform we’ve put out there, we’ve been able to do that each of the last three quarters. But we do expect getting back to more inflationary type expense growth at some point, but we’ll do our best to see if we can make it four quarters in a row where we can do better than we’ve laid out.
Richard Hill: Yes. That’s helpful. Ernie, I want to talk about your new lease rate growth relative to your turnover. You sort of alluded to this in your prepared remarks, but the new lease rate growth is pretty attractive, very attractive. We don’t really see any signs that it’s abating and your turnovers call it less than 25%. So it suggests that you have an embedded mark-to-market that that’s going to persist for two, three, maybe even a little bit longer than that. I’m not asking you to guide. I’m just asking you to walk through methodology with me, because it seems like absent rents coming down. There’s a sustainable runway for at least several years to have some pretty attractive same-store revenue.
Ernie Freedman: Yes. Certainly, you can look out over the next say 12 months to 18 months and based on where rates are today. I think as you go out to two or three years, you have to take into consideration all Rich, what do you think the overall market’s going to be. But your point is exactly right in that, we see a loss to lease in the portfolio that’s larger than we’ve seen before. And then importantly, we’re not pushing renewals to where market rates are. We don’t set market rates. The markets that’s market rates, but we’re working with our residents and you can see our renewal rates are less than half of what’s happening in the new lease rates, but that does set us up for a pretty favorable backdrop over the next period of time in terms of a loss of lease that’s in the low-double digits right now with regards to how that could play out, certainly over the next year and at least into the first part of 2023.
Richard Hill: Got it. Just one more quick macro question. And I don’t know if this is for Dallas or Charles, but I’m curious, home price appreciation has been really robust across the United States, obviously, showed some signs of slowing and the recent print, but Dallas or Charles, are you seeing any signs of weakness from supply, from build to rent, beginning to emerge in some markets where micro markets. What are you seeing on the ground?
Dallas Tanner: No, we’re not seeing any weakness in terms of like too much supply coming into the marketplace. It’s probably the opposite still this – the same thing that we’re filling in like the cost of gasoline or milk or some of these other things are impacting builders with relative to their supply chains. We obviously stay very close with some of our builder partners and just door and window packages alone are next to impossible to forecast correctly in terms of when they’ll have those things relative to bringing in the new supply. So Richard, it’s actually still a little bit of the opposite. And from our vantage point, it still feels like things are taking while to get through entitlements. Things are taking while it’s finished, but ultimately, we have seen resale supply crew back up just a little bit, which we view as a net positive. If we get a little bit more interest rate creep, I think that will help things in terms of easing up supply. And Ernie is right in his comments around the loss of lease, but we also don’t have the illusion that, that you can have 20% home price appreciation forever. I was looking at the case showing numbers from this point in time last year and a look back basis, it was like 6%. And if you look at our markets, it’s like 22% right now. It’s just – it’s a little bit crazy. And it’s a moment in time where we’re feeling the supply chain challenge and there just isn’t enough quality housing available right now.
Richard Hill: Thanks, guys. Congrats on early next quarter.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you, Rich.
Operator: Thank you. We now have the next question from Sam Choe of Credit Suisse. So Sam, please go ahead when you’re ready.
Sam Choe: Hi guys, congrats on a great quarter. I guess first going back to guidance, I guess holding that level of conservatism and the numbers make sense, but I guess this year, you guys have been performing very well with that occupancy at 98% turnover really trending lower. I’m just curious like are we – have you guys seen enough of your resident base and their behaviors to start thinking about if this is the new normal. And if that’s not the case, I’m just curious like what are some concerns you have going forward in this current dynamic?
Charles Young: Yes. So this is Charles here. Thanks for the question. When we look at overall leasing fundamentals and you ask whether it’s the new normal, we’re in a really healthy position and you called it, we’re at 98% occupancy. You’ve been there all year. Demand is really high for our well located homes. And how long will this last, we’ll see that last question and conversation was around our embedded loss to lease. And I think that gives us a good opportunity on the renewable side to keep that as high as it’s been. We’ve been accelerating on the renewal side since last summer. Every quarter has been going up, which is really healthy. And we’re seeing that actually go into Q4 as well. The new lease side, we’re still kind of in that mid to high teens, we’re not seeing typical seasonality. So it’s hard to predict how long it’s going to last, but we’re in a really healthy position and set up well to go into 2022.
Sam Choe: Got it, got it. That’s helpful color. I guess, it’s been really good to see that the external growth story is really coming back for you guys. Now, when I look at what – when Ernie mentioned the loss to lease dynamic that’s going on right now. I kind of looked at your markets in Seattle, Phoenix and Las Vegas, where that discrepancy is pretty, is large. So with that said, I saw that some of the acquisitions are more weighted to certain markets. So if I’m looking at Las Vegas, how is that local, like, supply dynamic, like trending in that area? And obviously, I’m thinking that maybe the disposition plan over time might allow you to kind of reallocate capital into these markets, where you can kind of really take advantage of the situation. Am I kind of thinking about everything correctly?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. I think you’re thinking about a lot in that question. There are a few things, let me just make sure that I try to touch on the major points. I think, your first question – your last question around capital allocation is one that we’ve always taking really a very deliberate approach to in where we invest capital and why. As you called out, in specific markets like Las Vegas and Phoenix, the Southwest Sunbelt type markets have seen an outperformance over really the last eight to 10 years, in terms of what we’re seeing with net migration, household formation. And ultimately, that’s showing itself in home price appreciation and the rate growth that we’re seeing with the corresponding growth in the home pricing. We will continue to invest capital in the parts of the country, where we believe we’re going to continue to see that outperformance. You haven’t seen us invest capital, for example, in the Midwest over the last five or six years, because we want to make sure that our shareholders are getting the appropriate exposure where the growth is going to be the greatest. Deliberately, couple of years ago, we started selling out of some of our concentrations in Midwest, and we started reallocating capital into markets like Phoenix, where a couple of years ago, we were only at 7,000 units. I think today we’re closer to like 8,700 units. We want to continue to grow those types of markets, because they are seeing this type of performance, whereas supply gets tight. So yes, that is our blended approach to how we think about risk adjusted returns. We want to always try to strike that right balance between the appreciation of the asset, where we have the strongest conviction around what’s going to happen with our revenue streams and how rate growth could be impacted. And then make sure that we’re investing our time and our capital accordingly.
Sam Choe: Got it. Thank you so much, Dallas.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Jeff Spector of Bank of America. So Jeff, please go ahead.
Jeff Spector: Good morning. Thank you, and congrats on the quarter. First question, I’d like to focus on demand and everyone’s trying to, of course, predict forecast growth in demand. You commented on your resident satisfaction stats, and again, turnover continues to trend lower. I know you do a lot of data analytics. I don’t know if you can share anything on this call to discuss a little bit more, where you see demand, how long – how the trend in your renters staying – the length of the renter staying in your homes. What do you see this going over the next couple of years?
Charles Young: Yes, this is Charles. Great question. Bottom line, we’re seeing really healthy demand. And when you couple that with our low turnover and a high occupancy, we’re in really great shape. I’ll share a couple of stats from our recent marketing survey of our move-ins in Q3. The majority, 80% are still coming from single family, so they know the product, but what they’re attracted to is the single family home, obviously, but our locations infill. The two top reasons that they’re moving to SFR and IH on specifically are for more space, which obviously single family provides and closer to work, which most of our infill homes do that. We also – we asked – what’s important to you and they said 78% are looking to have that extra office or bonus room. So those things, as you think about long-term demand and the trends of work from home and all that, put us in a really healthy position, again, coupled with our markets we’re seeing demand in the west. We’re seeing a lot of movement to the Southeast Florida, specifically Atlanta. And it’s showing up in our rent numbers. So we’re doing really well there. On top of that, you asked about where we are in terms of length of stay continues to move up. We’re on with that lower turnover, people are staying longer. And then I mentioned this in our remarks, our average household is over 120,000. It puts us at a rent to income ratio of 5 times, which is as healthy as we’ve seen. So all that really puts us in a really great shape what we think for years to come.
Jeff Spector: Thanks, Charles, I guess on that length of stay, is there anything more specific you can provide? I mean, again, I know everyone’s trying to forecast, like, where this business is heading over the next 5, 10, 20 years. Like, what’s the longest length of stay you’re seeing in the portfolio is that and what percent of the portfolio was that? Just trying to, again, see where that could hit?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Our portfolio, like I said, it’s been our residents are staying longer and longer. And what we’re seeing is, they’re into their third year and it’s continuing to grow. And with this low turnover, we expect that’s just going to get longer and longer well into three years. We’ll see how it plays out over time.
Charles Young: I think, Jeff, average length of someone’s staying now is over 32 months in our average lease term is 15 months. I mean, someone’s renewing on average twice from their initial lease term with that. That just continues to increase by about a month to month and a half each quarter. That’s in the trend we’ve seen for the last many quarters.
Jeff Spector: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We now have another question on the line. We now have a question from Nick Joseph of Citi. Sir, your line is now open.
Nick Joseph: Thank you. It seems like the political and regulatory environment around the broader single family rental sector is becoming more of a topic and potentially a risk. How are you dealing with it from an organizational and an operational standpoint?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Hi, Nick. Dallas here. Great question. We’ve been really dealt with this for almost 10 years since we started the business in terms of being active in both purchasing homes and in standardizing the single family rent environment. We obviously have a team of people here both from a PR front and also from legal perspective. And we’ve dealt with a variety of challenges over the years. So going back, two and four years ago, we dealt with some of the rent control challenges and some of the ballots that were within different markets and we’re very active in that space. And we’ve also – you have had range of inquiries over time with legislative bodies or groups wanting to understand more about what it is that we do now. The stories that really easy one, because single family for rent has gone on in this country for over 200 years, but it’s organizing yourself and making sure that you have the data in front of you that you can share with whomever the inquiry is coming from to help them understand really what’s going on with the space.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then, is there any update or in details that you give on the FTC letter that you received? I think that was disclosed in early September.
Dallas Tanner: No, not really. We’ve gotten inquiries from time to time from different legislative bodies, pre-pandemic, we were working with the house financial services committee as an industry and getting information out there. And so from time to time, we do get these inquiries. We wanted to make sure that we disclosed on the letter that we got from the FTC, but no update as of right now.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Nick.
Operator:
. :
Dennis McGill: Hi, thank you. Dallas, first question just goes to, you mentioned the ability to still buy an attractive 5% cap rate. And best planner, if you could maybe explain a little bit, why you think you haven’t seen more compression at cap rate over the last 12 or 18 months, given how much capital has been focused on the sector institutional capital that is. And how much yield compression there has been in sister industries, especially multifamily and the chase for yield in general around assets.
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Great questions. Let me answer the second part first. So I think we get a little myopic at times, when we think about SFR, in terms of the volume. And there certainly is a lot of capital coming into the space. It’s validation of the fact that, the business can exist in a very favorable or even non-favorable environment, like, what we had with the pandemic. But with that being said, you got to take a step back, there’s $6.5 million resale transactions every year in the U.S. And so as you start to think about SFR operators or investors wanting to be active in that cohort every year, we are a very small percentage of the overall buying and selling that goes on in the marketplace. By the way, it’s one of the reasons why this is a great business. It’s just a very liquid marketplace for both end users and for investors. Now, the reason I don’t think we’ve seen the compression Dennis is a couple of things. One is, you have to remember, and I talked about this in an earlier comment around [indiscernible] but the home price appreciation has been fairly dramatic and say the last 12 to 18 months. It’s been very steady for the last 10 years. We’ve seen in kind of a similar fashion, really over the last year, year and a half, we’ve seen rate really keep up with what we’re seeing with pricing. Now that won’t grow to the sky. We don’t have illusions of the fact that that’s normal. We would typically expense mid to high single digits for the way that we would think about rate growth in a normal year. We’ve just been lucky as operators that the environment or the marketplace doesn’t have enough supply. So it’s supporting the rate growth in a similar fashion. Now that will come down over time and distance. But again, going back to the first point, there’s a lot of transactions happening in the space that are happening in and around us of our operators in fact, with much more scale. So I think what we’ve been really good at is picking our spots. We’ve been active in parts of the country that lend themselves to that better performance, like I talked about before. But we’re also very deliberate about where we invest capital and why. If you look at what we’ve done to date, I think we’re close to 2000 homes acquired on the balance sheet through the third quarter. That’s really diminimous in that world of 6.5 million resales. So as long as you know, where you’re investing capital and why, I think you can find that outperformance and you stick to your investment thesis and as Ernie mentioned and I mentioned in our earlier comments, we just have a good cost of capital or generally good cost of capital right now, so we’re taking advantage of it.
Dennis McGill: Does that imply to some degree that a lot of the institutions that we all read about and the scale that we see others trying to gain that they’re targeting different markets or price points than you are?
Dallas Tanner: It could. I mean, a lot of the build to rent story you hear about right now is happening a little further out than other parts of the country, quite frankly, we just don’t operate. I think we do have some parallels with other platforms where we may bump up against each other in a couple of markets, but generally speaking, I think, you know this Dennis, we buy a more expensive product that’s much more infill. It’s differentiated from the large majority of our peers. And so I think our average price point in Q3 was close to $440,000 on balance sheet. That’s a much more expensive home than a majority, I would say of a lot of the new capital coming into the marketplace is targeting.
Dennis McGill: Got it. And then maybe just one more, just to change gears a bit. We’ve seen a lot from home builders, as well as iBuyers struggles with getting homes, either built or acquired and renovated and back to market. Are you running into any similar challenges on your acquisitions? Or can you elaborate a bit on as you acquire homes today, whether the pace of getting them back to market and least has changed at all?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. No, it’s great that we have the buying volume that we have. And we’re focusing in a few markets, these are markets for the majority that we have great teams on the ground who are ready to take this – take on the challenge. The volume is real and we’re paying attention to it, but we’re able to keep up and we’re pushing them through. A lot of these homes are like Dallas said, really in good shape and we know what we need to do on the rehab side. And it sets us up nicely. A lot of these homes will be ready early next year, and we’ll – what we’ve seen and what we’ve been able to bring through, have been really healthy in terms of what we’ve been able to gain on rent. So we feel like we’re in good shape to be in a manager.
Dennis McGill: Thank you, guys. Good luck.
Ernie Freedman: Thanks, Dennis.
Operator: Thank you. We now have Brad Heffern from RBC. So Brad, please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. A couple more on acquisitions. So obviously the guidance went up a lot to the $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. I’m curious if that was just the large number of opportunities that you were sort of unexpectedly seeing this year? Or if you think that that’s something that’s sustainable and how should we think about the Pulte homes next year being complimentary to that?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Great question. So, we started to signal a few quarters ago that we are seeing a few more opportunities in the marketplace. And to be clear, the 1700 homes that we bought in Q3, the vast majority of these are just one-off buying. And Charles, talked a little bit about this. But the power of our platform is really unique in terms of our ability to identify one-off acquisitions and to be able to then process those, put our own finish standards on those homes and have them ready for lease in a real high velocity way of doing things. Hard to say what the marketplace could look and feel like a couple of quarters from now. But so long as we have a decent cost of capital and we can buy at these kinds of prices, we’d like to stay opportunistic. We certainly love to look for opportunities to buy scale. One of the ways with which we know we can bring dedicated scale into the platform is partnerships with builders like the one we have with Pulte. Now, we also started talking about that a few quarters ago. We’re active with a lot of different builders. Pulte is just one of our preferred partners who we’re going to try to have programmatic buying opportunities with. And they’ve been a terrific partner. They do a fantastic job as the nation’s second largest home builder. And we’ll start to see those come into our normal distribution towards kind of the end of the third quarter of next year. John and Peter have done a nice job on the team working with the Pulte Group to start to look at parts of the country that we can start to forecast out a year or two in advance. And that gives us a real strategic advantage. And by the way, we aren’t incurring any costs for that. Like we haven’t had to upsize our team or bring on a ton of additional G&A to be able to run that program. So we feel like we’re in a really good spot and that will compliment what we’re already doing pretty well in the one-off space.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And I was wondering if you could talk about the iBuyer channel a little bit. Obviously we saw the news about below pausing. Is that news meaningful for you guys in any way? And can you talk about maybe more recently, how much that channels representative the acquisition volumes?
Dallas Tanner: iBuying has always been a pretty small percentage of what we buy. It’s one of our many channels that I talked about in my opening remarks. We want to have all the channels open and available to us. I don’t want to comment specifically on any one company’s strengths or weaknesses in a particular quarter. But these things tend to ebb and flow and I’m sure they’ll work through it. I think it probably speaks more to some of the labor challenges that are in the marketplace, which Charles just discussed. It’s not an easy environment to operate in if you don’t have your infrastructure set up for the long haul. And even then you’ve got to manage those pressures as they kind of flex different ways. But certainly to present more opportunities for platform buying with companies like ours, but we are friendly partner at all iBuyers, we love the fact that the transactions in the residential space are starting to digitize and get more efficient. That makes a lot of sense for the end user, for investors, for anyone that’s really active in single family.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks.
Operator: We now have another question on the line from Alan Peterson from Green Street. So, Alan, please go ahead when you’re ready.
Alan Peterson: Thanks, guys. Just focusing still on external growth. Dallas, you touched on some of the supply chain bottlenecks that are affecting your builder partners. Is this affecting pricing with partners like Pulte? Are you seeing any compression in those stabilized yields than you have previously quoted on those next swath of acquisitions there?
Dallas Tanner: I would say generally we feel pretty good about what we’ve talked about in the past with those on the call and in our – the way we were viewing the world. We build a structure with them specifically that protects both companies in the event that we have, expense creep, but it allows us to kind of rethink and reset together if there’s market volatility. We saw that with lumber by the way. Price of lumber is coming back to earth. We think we’ll see that in some of these other categories. It’s just – and it’s not just – it doesn’t just lend itself to the cost of goods sold to be really clear. If you think what happened with the pandemic in terms of new supply coming in, it’s slowed down the entitlement processes with municipalities and cities. It does a lot of things, it disrupted. In the same way, it’s hard to find a car right now or a used car. It’s very similar in terms of bringing new supply into the marketplace. It just created a little bit of a log jam from a supply chain efficiency perspective. We forecast and would believe that this will all start to regulate and get back to normal and start to bring some of that expedited supply back into the marketplace over time.
Alan Peterson: Got you. So the stabilized 5% yields are still kind of intact for your partnership with Pulte then.
Ernie Freedman: Actually it’s no different than we’ve quoted before that this action, we’re getting those at a better cap rate, so that hasn’t changed. We’ve been typically 25, 50 basis points, what we’re doing in a market with that relationship. And we haven’t seen any change in that dynamic.
Alan Peterson: Perfect. And then that’s one for me. Charles, can you provide some context on what’s driving some of the sequential revenue declines in Dallas and then just a little bit of the softness in Denver? Just trying to dig in on market fundamentals there.
Charles Young: Yes. I mean, I guess if I look at both of those markets in terms of rent growth, we’re accelerating in both especially in Dallas, we’ve had really good kind of increases on the new lease side of Q3 of 15.5% and renewals have been healthy at close to 9% – close to 6% for a nice blend. So, I think as you think about revenue in Dallas, we love that market, we’re buying in the market. We’re going to continue to grow there. Denver is similar. It’s been a healthy market. New leases are almost 12% and renewals at 7% – 7.5% or so. So, both markets are really in our perspective, we have good leadership on the ground and they’re moving in the right direction. We are buying a lot in Denver and we’re paying attention to that, which is great. And I think that’s one of those markets like Dallas that we want to grow both of them. And we think they’re going to be good markets for us long-term.
Alan Peterson: Got you. Thanks guys. Appreciate the time.
Operator: The next question is from Keegan Carl with Berenberg. Keegan, I’ve opened your line.
Keegan Carl: Hey, thanks for taking the questions, guys. Just one for me. Given the current housing shortage is your intention to implement the spec platform changed at all. It’s just my view, but I think now it’d be an opportunity time. You look at a number of people who might want to take advantage of the hot housing market yet not relocate or buy at current price levels.
Dallas Tanner: Yes. We like your thinking. I mean, it certainly feels like there’s going to be some opportunities and as things that we’ve looked at and how to bring, a little more social housing product into the single family space. And while we’re not necessarily ready today to talk about any pivot or change. And there are certainly categories that we’re looking at and spending more time on. We do think that a sale leaseback product over time is a great way for people who want to think about retirement that want to spend, part of the year in different markets. And we’ve seen that even in our own portfolio where we’ll have, a couple pickup lease in Florida, because they’re going to spend half the year there, but they spent, the other half of the year up north, somewhere in the warmer months. So yes, the short answer is, in the evolution of our company and the things that we’re focused on. I think you’ll start to see us overtime explore more of these types of product and weave them into our business model. But not necessarily tomorrow, but overtime. Absolutely.
Keegan Carl: Got it. Would a pilot program look like on that one you just focus on one of your smaller markets and test it out. Where do you think you’d be pretty aggressive from the job?
Dallas Tanner: I’d hate to speculate. Now give you a little bit of some kind of real-world we did do a lot of sale lease back 10 years ago. When we had homes where you’re buying something through distress channels and someone was leasing back. So, we’re very familiar with the process side of it, but you could always get your point. You could pilot it in a more robust form and in a market you could partner with other ventures that are currently doing it and bring back office expertise. I think there’s a lot of ways you can think about it. We’re not in a place where we know exactly yet how we want to approach this, but we certainly see these social housing opportunities as a way for that subscription economy to craft a choice. And that’s something that we believe in a big way at invitation homes is that. There is not a one size fits all approach to how you want to live. For some people it’s ownership, for some people it’s leasing, for some people it’s an option to buy. And so I think as those markets continue to develop, we’re going to play close attention and pick our spots, if, when and where we want to participate.
Keegan Carl: Got it. That’s it from me. Thanks guys.
Operator: We have another question on the line from Rich Hightower of Evercore. So Rich, please go ahead. When you’re ready.
Rich Hightower: Hey, good morning, everybody. A lot of good questions so far. But I want to go back to the 120,000 median household income. I think you sit on new leases recently. So, I just want to get a sense of the growth rate, year-over-year in that statistic and how do we correlate that to rent, to home price appreciation and how do you expect that to evolve over the next year or two?
Dallas Tanner: Well, we’ve seen, I guess the easiest way to talk about it as we’ve seen our income to rent ratio increase from about 4:6 to 4:7 to now it’s over five times with the numbers that, that Charles talked about. We’re about 123,000. So in over that period of time, you’ve seen rent growth pretty significant. So, we’re seeing that for the resident who’s moving in. So it was, that’s how we track this. It’s our new residents that they’re keeping up with rent growth in terms of where their income is. So it’s a very correlated, almost identically are actually slightly better, because we’ve gone from about 4:6, 4:7 5 to 5:2, 5:3 with regards to what our average income to rent ratio is. To predict what that’s going to be into the future would be challenging. But we certainly seen a good trend over the last many years of our average income going from, I think, around $100,000, maybe even a little bit less than that, that IPO five years ago to where we are today.
Rich Hightower: Okay. Well, if that’s true or anything, 100 to 120 is I guess that would approximate over since the IPO, let’s call it 20%. So that’s matching what, new leases are growing in a year almost. I mean, that’s just a pretty remarkable statistic. Don’t you think? I’m just trying to – I’m just trying to think about how to square that with everything that we’re seeing right now. Everything just seems off the charts and I’m trying to figure out whether it all makes sense or not. I guess it’s all good from invitations perspective.
Dallas Tanner: Well, remember, we’re in very infill locations, people who want to live close to good schools, close to their jobs. And so, we’re not necessarily marketing to the broad in terms of the averages. And then again, thinking about the markets we’re into, and we’re specifically in the Sunbelt and the Southeast and the west, where people are migrating to. And so there’s a big cohort of people out there who like the subscription economy who want to rent and they certainly have the economics and the capability to buy, but they’re choosing not to for a lot of reasons. And we’re trying to provide them that product and that service, and Charles and team are delivering on that. So, I think it’s, it continues to work for us and we hope for, we can do to make that available for folks going forward.
Rich Hightower: All right. I appreciate the color. And then maybe one follow-up question, just on obviously invitations get a very deliberate infill strategy. As you guys have mentioned many times on this call and also in the past, I mean, how would you contrast that with the strategies of several sort of new entrance or even kind of long-standing competitors in the market and even within the build to rent space? I mean, how far out of the city center are you seeing a “competitive SFR product being bought or added when in reality it’s probably not that competitive”. I mean, how would you characterize the landscape there?
Dallas Tanner: We’d agree with that Rich. And I think the way we differentiate ourselves from others in this space are location, scale, highs in market. So, we’re very focused on infill locations. And we do think that many of the new single family projects that are coming up or are more further out or they’re in more tertiary markets. So, we’re very focused on location in terms of where we want to be on a market, as well as what markets we’ve chosen to be in. We believe scales a differentiator in terms of be able to run more efficiently. And I think it helps solve a lot of the issues that others may be having around supply chain, because we’ve been in these markets for a long time. And so we have longstanding labor relationships and supply relationships doesn’t mean that we’re immune to it. But, I think we’re dealing maybe better with that than what others have been reporting. And then finally highs in market. And it helps us from our being smart about how we acquire and how we operate.
Charles Young: Yes. I want to add one thing here, Rich. Dallas, Ernie hit scale and I just cannot stress enough based on, the 10 or 11 years we’ve all been doing this. Scale is your friend. It allows us to invest in technology. It allows us to update systems loves to hire better, hire, better people like to replicate the type of platform that invitation homes has today, is very difficult. Even in this environment. Now there’s a lot of hot money coming into the space, which, in large part would probably do fine. And that’ll be treated more like a trade. It’ll be interesting to see how that works itself out over time. But the power of our platform is really showing itself. Right now, I would say through the pandemic and as we start to recover the consistency, the ability to be able to operate, to communicate with the residents in a way that allows you to have turn times like we’ve had over the last 18 months is just remarkable. And that that in itself is I think something that is very hard for new money to come in and try to replicate.
Rich Hightower: Okay, great. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. We have another question from [indiscernible]. Sir please go ahead I have opened your line.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. So good morning. Had a couple of follow-up questions here on my list. I guess starting first with the robust rent growth you’re seeing the acceleration here into third quarter. I guess I’m curious is the FTC inquiry is having any impact on your rental pricing strategies and also can you give us some color on the new and renewal rates from October and what you’re sending out from November, December? Thanks.
Charles Young: Sure. So hi, Andy [ph] Charles here. So to your first question, no one packed from the FTC in terms of leasing perspective. If you just step back and think about the overall performance of our leasing a lot of it is, as I spoke to low turnover, high occupancy grade locations puts us in a really healthy position and on the new lease side, the west continues to lead, which is great. You look at Phoenix and you look at Vegas at almost 30% and 29% respectively. But it’s not just those markets at all markets. And it was really exciting to see what’s happening in Florida and in the Southeast, as you think, are in Atlanta, Atlanta new lease a 20%, Tampa, 21%, Jacksonville at 19%, these are really strong numbers for our portfolio. And we’re seeing that kind of maintain itself going October to your question here. And then on the renewal side, I talked about this a little earlier. We’ve seen just really acceleration again, they kind of lag the newly side and new leases arisen so quickly, but we’ve been increasing almost every month since last summer. And in Q3 you saw that we came in at a renewals of that were really healthy 7.8% versus where we were last year, just over 3%, with September ending at 8.4%. And that kind of growing trend is continuing into October to your question. And then, as we went out in terms of what we’re asking going forward, we’re in the high eights to nines, as you think through to January. So, we’re set up well to continue that renewal side. And that’s where I think there’s a real change from the typical seasonality that we might see this time of year is really just not showing up.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it, got it. Appreciate the color, Charles. I think you also mentioned you received $25 million of rental assistance year-to-date. I guess I’m curious what your expectation is for the full year, I guess, the rest of the calendar year here and what that implies for the opportunity next year, and then maybe also some color on bad debt. You made some progress there on getting it down to year-over-year still above the long-term run rate. How are you thinking about that opportunity near term? Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: Yes. On rental assistance it’s actually about $22 million this year is about $3 million last year. So year-to-date, sorry, life time dates to $25 million that you referenced. And with that, progressively get stronger and stronger as we got to say, the May June timeframe into the August, September where each month in August, September, we’re collecting about $5 to $6 million of rental assistance. Hard to predict how that’s going to continue to play out. There are tens of millions of dollars of applications still outstanding for our residents in the local jurisdictions, the $0.06 are doing a better job of trying to work. Those there’s an importantly operating teams are helping those folks through that process where we can. Just hard to say how long that run rate will continue or whether it will continue to accelerate as we’ve gotten into the fourth quarter here in and into early next year. That said, we still have a large accounts receivable balance that has a lot of historically overdue balances. So if rental assistance programs stay open, if they continue to stay funded, there’s certainly an opportunity for us to have some greater collections and hopefully continue to see our sequential decrease in bad debt that you’ve seen over the last quarter. A couple of quarters here in the third quarter, bad debt was 1% of gross rental revenues, which is better than what we had in the second quarter, which was better than we had in the first. So it does feel like we’re, we continue on that glide path to get, hopefully back to our historical numbers sometime toward the end of next year, in terms of being closer to 40 basis, points of a bad debt. And then maybe we do a little bit better for a period of time with catch-up from the rental assistance. And then you see a period of time where, bad debt could go. Maybe even maybe, maybe negative as things are caught up from the delinquency side, we’ll just have to see if that happens.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And what’s that receivables balance probably should know this, but do you have that number handy?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, it’s today it’s on a gross basis; it’s over $50 million. It’s about $55 million of rent receivables that are due to us. And of course we have a big reserve against that. So the net number on our financial statements is much lower it’s about $13 million or $14 million from an on a net basis. And so, we’ll see what we can do to try to get rent assistance in for, you know, to help our residents to help bring that number down over a period of time.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. You have a question on the line from Chandni Luthra of Goldman Sachs. So Chandni, please go ahead.
Chandni Luthra: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Team, I was wondering, given demand supply metrics are hugely tilted in your favor. How were you thinking about ancillary opportunities at the moment? Is there more upside there? Are there areas, that perhaps you hadn’t contemplated earlier that you think are now on the table? Just trying to assess, how that could look in 2022, as you continue to get skilled?
Charles Young: Hi, this is Charles. It’s a great question. Even through the pandemic, ancillary has been a big focus for us. About two years ago, we did our investor meeting and we put out a target that we’d get a 15 million to 30 million run rate on our ancillary services by the end of three years, which would be the end of 2022; we’re on track to be at the high end of that. And we’re going to do everything we can to overachieve, and that’s just the beginning as we think about it. And so this has been a major kind of focus of building the pipeline and the infrastructure of projects to get us there, and the main focus has really been on around expanding and lowering the cost of our smart home technology. In 2022, we expect we’re going to roll out video doorbells, which will help to, to grow that. And it’s something as we survey our residents that they’re asking for, in today’s world, that’s really valuable we’ve done the filter program that helps us on the reduction of costs on our filters, but also provides a lower revenue where we’re working in things around pets and pests in terms of a deal national deal with Terminex. And we see many programs like that, that will continue to roll out at 2022 and beyond services around energy, landscaping, handyman services, broadband services. So there’s a lot that we’re working on and we’re being thoughtful around when and how we roll them out. And then when you put this on top of what our residents are looking for and asking for, and we talked about this a little earlier in the call. We think this is going to extend the state that our residents are going to stay with us because we’re giving what they’re asking for. We’re making it really convenient and easy for them to lease with us. So this is a big part of our kind of long-term plan. And we’re on track for a, what we set out a couple years ago.
Chandni Luthra: Got it. In for my follow-up. I like to talk about, home price appreciation that we seen so far. Could you perhaps give us any early reads on how we should be thinking about real estate taxes next year in light of the level of home prices that we see?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. It’s always a challenge to try to predict where that’s going to be. But I’d say is that you’re certainly a risk assessments are going to be materially higher than where they’re at today, but we typically see in the past and in cycles like there, - the is that no-interest rates come down because just because home price appreciation is up 10%, 15%, 20%, your real estate tax bill, doesn’t go up 10%, 15% or 20%. The people who live in those jurisdictions, the people who vote for the various folks who make those decisions, overall on average, those people’s incomes are not up 10%, 15%, 20%. So I think overall, you’ll see for the next few years, real estate taxes continue to be a risk item in terms of having greater than inflationary growth rate. But it would be surprising, in would not really match up that we’ve seen in prior cycles to see that it would be as much as you’ve seen an increase as you’ve seen where home price appreciation has gone.
Chandni Luthra: Got it. Congratulations, once again, on a strong quarter.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you.
Operator: We now have Jade Rahmani from KBW. So Jade, please go ahead.
Jade Rahmani: Thank you very much. Wondering if you could comment on recent color, most satisfaction scores have they been trending and also, has there been any negative perspective on the dramatic levels of rent growth that we’re seeing?
Charles Young: Yes, this is Charles. Resident satisfaction continues to be a bright spot for us. Our teams are doing an amazing job in the field. As you may know, we still monitor and ask for surveys after every interaction with the resident, whether it’s the move in, move out, work order. And our teams do a great job and it helps to inform what our residents are experiencing and how it’s going. I will note that we’ve continued to see a rise and, you take our social scores of Google and Yelp. And we were over four on average across all of our markets. And so all that is really healthy. Are there areas where we want to continue to improve it? That’s why we do the surveys and we’re learning. But we like as what our teams have been doing and we’re continuing to focus on it.
Jade Rahmani: What was – rate?
Charles Young: Yes. And then yes, the we’ve been thoughtful on rate on the new lease side. You have to remember, this is a vacant house we’re really we marked to the market. And so, we’re just kind of setting rents at what the market is. And so you don’t really get any pushback there. On the renewable side, we try to be really thoughtful. We’re actually based on what’s happening when new leases pricing below what’s market. Typically and we want to be thoughtful about that. And we work closely with the national team that sets rents and our local team to make sure that we’re being as thoughtful as we can we’re residence.
Dallas Tanner: And Jade it’s the – just for the last 90 days, we had a record high retention rate from residence, and you saw that we had the lowest turnover rate we’ve ever had in the third quarter. In third quarter, doesn’t have numbers this low typically. So I think the consumer understands what’s going on and actually feels like they’re getting a pretty good deal in terms of where we’re putting our renewal rates compared to where the market is at, which is, you know, less than half the increase you’re seeing in market rates is where our renewals are today.
Jade Rahmani: Thank you very much. Appreciate the conservative approach you guys add also wanted to ask about supply chain. I guess, could you remind me what percentage of the work on a house is done with in-house teams and in your view, do you feel that you’ve experienced the brunt of the ongoing supply chain destructions or is this potentially coming headwind?
Charles Young: Yes. So to your first question, our maintenance staff on average does about half of the work orders that come through. And this usually the handyman work that they’re doing the larger roof and concrete and stuff like that. If there is that we’ll outsourced all the vendors, maybe HVC and the like that’s a seasonal metric, so it goes down a little bit in the summer. But this time of year we’re actually trending at about a 50%. Right now we’re not seeing a lot of that kind of supply chain stuff hit the, that a work order maintenance work directly. We did see some early noise in the pandemic around appliances and other items. There’s a little bit of cost pressure that, we’re looking at, but we have a couple of advantages when it comes to that. And, you know, that’s, our Dallas talked about it. Our scale and size really helps. So what our centralized procurement teams do a great job of being able to kind of mitigate that. We’re not going to keep it at zero, but it allows us to kind of fare better than others. And then on the labor side, you can see in our numbers, it’s not showing up, but there’s some pressure out there and we’re paying attention to it. And what’s great is our, that’s another thing that our local scale, local density allows us. If we do have somebody turn over the next person, next teammate could step up. And, we’re attractive platform being the leader in industry we’re able to recruit, and our team does a great job of recruiting from an HR perspective.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks. And just to sum up the topic, considering the pressures out there, supply chain three theater about, okay, what is the main driver for the lower same store expense guide?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, it’s really just the earning from what’s happened in the first part of the year. You can certainly see that the implied guidance for the fourth quarter, Jade’s higher than we’ve run this year, significantly higher. And so we do expect to have some pressures that we talked about in terms of the real estate taxes, a little bit higher than we expected. We saw in the first three quarters personnel costs because of the outperformance we’ve had this year and things like that. But we read and you saw the drop was the fact that we had an extraordinary expense a quarter here in the third quarter that 90 days ago, we didn’t think would be that strong.
Jade Rahmani: Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Jade.
Operator: Thank you. We have the final question on the line from Andrew Rosivach from Wolfe Research. So Andrew, I’ve opened your line, please go ahead.
Andrew Rosivach: Guys, you’ve answered all my questions. Thanks a lot and congrats on a good quarter.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks Andrew.
Operator: This ends our question-and-answer session and marks a conclusion of our conference. Thank you again for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-29 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Invitation Homes Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Scott McLaughlin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Scott McLaughlin: Good morning and welcome. Joining me today from Invitation Homes are Dallas Tanner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer. During this call, we may reference our second quarter 2021 earnings press release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures to the extent available without unreasonable effort in our earnings release and supplemental information, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Dallas.
Dallas Tanner: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Last night, we posted our second quarter results, closing out a very strong first half of the year. The current fundamental tailwinds we are experiencing are among the best we have seen and we anticipate that these will stay with us for the foreseeable future. Demand for our high-quality, well-located single-family homes, continues to greatly exceed supply, as shown by our high occupancy and retention rates. Today, there are nearly 90 million people in their 20s and 30s in the United States. We expect this population surge to be heading our way for many years to come. As this segment of the populations form families and seek out more space and homes to live in, we see Invitation Homes as a part of a comprehensive housing solution that helps serve those who prefer the convenience and lifestyle of renting a single-family home. With our integrated platform delivering a first-rate resident experience and efficient operation, we believe we are well positioned to meet the rising demand for our product through continued growth. In this regard, we significantly enhanced our multi-channel strategy this past week with the announcement of our new strategic relationship with PulteGroup, the nation’s third largest homebuilder. Our preference from the beginning has been to partner with the best homebuilders rather than compete with them directly, and this strategic relationship greatly strengthens that approach. Over the next 5 years, we expect to buy approximately 7,500 new homes that Pulte will design and build and have already identified the first 1,000 homes across 7 communities located in the Sunbelt region. We love the approach of acquiring great product in great locations across a diverse subset of communities that will further enhance our risk-adjusted return profile for our investors. We look forward to welcoming our new residents into these neighborhoods, where families who both lease and own homes build the communities together. We are pleased to collaborate with Pulte in the important next chapter of our builder partnership story. It’s an exciting time as we invest to bring new homes to the market, complementing our other acquisition channels. Now, outside of our announcement with Pulte, we bought almost 1,600 homes so far this year through June 30 for $569 million. We are over halfway to our $1 billion acquisition target for this year. We remain confident that we can achieve our target during the second half of this year. Directing us in our effort is our three-pillar strategy of location, scale and eyes in markets. These differentiate us from our peers and support the acquisition engine we have designed and perfected over the last decade. Our first pillar, location, speaks to our focus on select markets with high population and job growth that offer good schools and easy access to employment centers and transportation corridors. Location is a major driver of outperformance as evidenced by our West Coast and our Sunbelt markets. The second pillar is scale. With about 5,000 homes per market on average, our scale is industry leading and extremely difficult for competitors to quickly or easily duplicate. And our third pillar is being high touch with eyes in markets. This refers to our local team of experts who oversee our resident services, leasing and investment decisions. Our eyes in market go beyond desk-bound associates and algorithms by investing with local insight and relationships in order to find the best homes at the best price. Together, these three pillars support our proven track record of disciplined growth and support our philosophy of genuine care. We think our occupancy of over 98%, turnover of only 25%, average length of stay now approaching 3 years, and high resident satisfaction scores are amongst the strongest indicators that our teams are delivering on our mission statement. Together with you, we make a house a home. We have lived out that mission in both good and challenging times. During the last 16 months, some of our residents have faced significant hardship. We have helped provide peace of mind to those who have been struggling by providing flexible payment structures, waiving late fees, assisting in securing rental assistance and forgiving past due balances. We have consistently gone above and beyond and I couldn’t be prouder of how our teams have supported our residents and communities during these challenging times. We will continue to follow all government directives, laws and regulations at the national state and local levels. And we will continue to go beyond what is required and work with those impacted by the pandemic, because that is who we have always been and that is who we will continue to be. Finally, I would like to wrap up with some thoughts on sustainability. We are continuously taking the steps necessary to be a responsible steward who encourages discussion, innovation and action amongst our peers, associates in the industry. Earlier this month, we announced our investment in Fifth Wall’s Climate Tech Fund, which is seeking solutions to reduce carbon emissions from the construction, ownership and operation of real estate. In addition to investing in future solutions, we continue to rollout initiatives to help limit the company’s carbon footprint and the environmental impact of our homes. These include our smart home technology, that help residents manage their homes and save up to 15% on their energy bills and our air filter home delivery program that provide better air quality and improve HVAC efficiency. Looking forward, we are focused on identifying new opportunities to advance further long-term sustainability efforts. In conclusion, I would like to recognize our nearly 1,200 associates across the country. You continue to be the driving force behind the value we create for both residents and shareholders. And I am grateful for your dedication to that mission. We could not be prouder of the work we are doing together to provide homes for tens of thousands of families who need or prefer to lease a home today. With that, I will now ask Charles to discuss our second quarter operating results in greater detail.
Charles Young: Thanks, Dallas. I’d like to begin by echoing your thanks to our associates for providing another quarter of exceptional care to our residents who place their trust in us to make the leasing a home friendlier and worry-free. Our positive momentum and focus on residents have resulted in another great quarter operationally on both the revenue and cost side. With outstanding fundamentals in our markets and excellent execution by our team, same-store NOI grew 8.4% year-over-year in the second quarter. Same-store core revenue was up 5.9% year-over-year driven by strong rental rate growth, continued strong occupancy and improved other property income. In addition, our collections came in at 99% of historical levels in the second quarter. On the expense side, expenses remained in check during the quarter. Same-store core expenses in the second quarter increased only modestly up 0.9% year-over-year aided by continued low turnover. Next, I will cover leasing trends for the second quarter. Year-over-year renewals increased 230 basis points to 5.8% and new leases increased 1,110 basis points to 13.8%. This drove blended rent growth to 8% or 470 basis points higher year-over-year. Same-store new and renewal lease rates have grown over the prior month every month this year. At the same time, same-store average occupancy came in at 98.3% in the second quarter and 80 basis points higher year-over-year. In fact, June was the ninth consecutive month that all 16 of our markets averaged above 97% occupancy. There are two main factors supporting our high occupancy. The first factor is continued strong demand for our high-quality and well-located homes. Included within that are favorable demographics and fundamentals that Dallas mentioned earlier. In addition to these, the need for more space remains the number reason for moving into our homes. The second factor is our continued improvement in our days to re-resident. During our first quarter earnings call, I told you that the number of days between when a resident moves out and a new resident moves in had decreased significantly to 29 days. We reduced this even further during the second quarter to only 23 days. Our goal is to make finding a new home and signing a new lease as simple as possible, and we are continually trying to improve ways we can lease quicker and move in faster. One of the ways we are doing that is through technology. Prospective residents are able to review floor plans and conduct virtual tours online, with a large majority choosing to do so on their mobile device. When a vacant home is available for an in-person tour, we are happy to work with their preference of doing either a guided tour or a self-tour using our smart home technology. But most of the time during the second quarter, our available homes were pre-leased to a new resident before that home was even rent-ready. With residents staying longer in our homes at such high occupancy, we are pleased to reintroduce our ProCare home visits in the second quarter after a temporary pause during the pandemic. As a reminder, ProCare is our unique proactive approach to serving our residents from move-in to move-out, including post move-in orientations, proactive service trips and pre-move-out visits. We believe regular proactive visits help us identify opportunities for both R&M and turn savings and provide an enhanced experience to our residents. In summary, thanks to the great work of our teams, we believe we are well positioned for the second half of 2021 and we are excited to keep this momentum going. We remain very focused on delivering outstanding service to our residents and outstanding results to our stockholders. With that, I will pass it along to Ernie.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today, I will cover the following three topics: first, balance sheet and capital markets activity; second, financial results for the second quarter; and third, updated 2021 guidance. Regarding our balance sheet and capital markets activity, we had over $1.1 billion in available liquidity through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility at the end of the second quarter. Earlier this month, we gave notice of our intent to settle conversions of our 3.5% convertible notes with common stock. We expect the $345 million of notes to convert into approximately 15 million shares on or before the maturity date of January 15, 2022. Post our announcement, to-date approximately $177 million of notes have converted into approximately 8 million shares of common stock. We anticipate the full conversion will reduce cash interest expense by approximately $12 million on an annualized basis, and on a Q2 pro forma basis, result in an improved net debt to EBITDA ratio of 6.7x, down from 7.0x on an as-reported basis. This will leave us with no debt maturing prior to December 2024. We also announced back in May that we closed $300 million of privately placed senior unsecured notes. The private placement jumpstarted our goal of transitioning toward a higher proportion of unsecured debt and improved the laddering of our debt maturities. It also came on the heels of receiving investment grade ratings from three of the rating agencies in April. We remain committed to further strengthening our balance sheet and are pleased with the progress we have already made since achieving investment grade. Turning next to our financial results for the second quarter, core FFO per share increased 14% year-over-year to $0.37 and AFFO per share increased 16.9% year-over-year to $0.32. These results exceeded our expectations. Based on our latest forecast through the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year 2021 same-store NOI growth guidance by 100 basis points to a range of 6.5% to 7.5%. This increase includes a 50 basis point increase in same-store core revenue growth in a range from 5% to 6%, while maintaining same-store core expense growth guidance in a range from 2.5% to 3.5%. Finally, we have increased our guidance for full year 2021 core FFO by $0.02 at the midpoint to $1.44 per share and increased full year 2021 AFFO by $0.02 at the midpoint to $1.24 per share. As Dallas mentioned at the beginning of our prepared remarks, we believe our differentiated strategy of focusing on location, scale and eyes in markets is the best formula for our business now and into the future. When coupled with a strong balance sheet, a robust internal and external growth model and an unwavering commitment to resident care, we believe Invitation Homes is best positioned to deliver outstanding results to our residents and stockholders. With that, let’s open up the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on another good quarter. I wanted to just go back and talk about the guide a little bit. And Ernie, I am sorry if I missed this in the detailed prepared remarks, but could you maybe walk us through what you are assuming for bad debt and other income in the second half of the year? I recognize in 2Q other income turned into a good guy and bad debt was neutral. Just trying to understand a little bit how conservative those numbers might be in the second half of the year relative to the guide?
Ernie Freedman: Sure. Thanks, Rich. Yes, specifically with other income and bad debt, you are right to point out that other income became a bit of a tailwind for us in the second quarter, because we had a comp where last year in the second quarter, we didn’t charge any late fees. And now we are charging late fees where permissible pretty much across the portfolio again, where it’s allowed. We expect that to continue here into the second half of the year. So, you should have a very good comp for the second half of the year and other income that was similar to what we saw in the second quarter. With bad debt, we were pleased to see that we saw some improvement a little bit faster than we thought we would. And we thought the second quarter was going to have more of a headwind. With regards to bad debt comparing to last year, we ended up coming in at the same number. You may recall last year, Rich, in the second half of 2020, we saw bad debt go into the low 2% range. We do expect that we hope and baked into our guidance that bad debt will continue to improve off the number that you saw in the second quarter. Still staying above our historical average of about 40 basis points significantly, but trailing down more into the mid-100 range, maybe a little bit better as we get to the fourth quarter. So that should be a tailwind for us, but this continue to be a tailwind for us, we would hope as we go into 2022 as well.
Rich Hill: Got it. And then moving to the expense side of the equation, it looks like expenses are going to be a little bit higher in the second half of the year. Some of that has to do with seasonality. But I also think if I remember correctly, some of this has to do with insurance costs and then maybe a little bit higher turnover. Do you think there is any scenario where the expense – the assumed expenses in the second half of the year could test the low end of the range or said another way, what would drive it to the low end of the range and give you confidence that could maybe be a little bit lower than what it implies at the midpoint?
Ernie Freedman: Yes, that’s a good question, Rich. Yes, there is certainly absolutely scenarios where we can do better than the point in the range and maybe get down to the low end or maybe even do a little bit better. We do think in the second half of the year, the expense numbers will be higher for really the following reasons. One, we had a really good second quarter real estate tax number that you might have seen on a year-over-year basis as we had some refunds come through. We expect to get back more to where we expected the run-rate to be for real estate taxes during the second half of the year, which is probably about a 4% increase year-over-year. And that’s coming off of basically that 1% number that you saw in the second quarter. The real estate taxes are the biggest component of our expenses. They are almost 60% of our expenses. We do think turnover will continue to maybe – well shouldn’t continue – could increase year-over-year. We haven’t seen that yet this year. So we have built that into our guidance that we do expect a year-over-year increase in turnover. We will just have to see if that comes to fruition. Insurance costs, as you pointed out, are running higher than they were last year, up about 7%, which is I think industry leading in the residential space. I think most people are seeing increases in the 20% to 30% space in the residential world with insurance. So, that’s worked out pretty well for us. So, we hope that we will have a similar performance that we saw in the first and second quarter, where things came in a little bit better than we originally thought. We are going to certainly try hard to do that. But we wanted to lay out something that we thought gave us – where we thought things could potentially come on in expenses and just look to outperform like we’ve had so far this year.
Rich Hill: Got it. That’s helpful. Dallas, just one more question from me, I am curious what you’re hearing about homebuilders. With similar partnerships relative to what you just announced with Pulte, is this sort of something that you can replicate on a much larger scale? And I’m asking really from – I suspect you would have done a lot of these over the past 5 years if you could have. But are you seeing much more demand from the homebuilders to do these? And is this just a template that could take you from 7,500 homes over the next 5 years to something incrementally higher than that?
Dallas Tanner: Well, good question, Rich. First and foremost, I think we’ve talked about this really in the last few quarters. We work with a variety of builders generally speaking in the past. And we’ve done stuff with both public, private builders, boutique builders in different markets. The Pulte relationship has continued to develop over time. Ryan Marshall and I got to know each other a couple of years ago, and this is something that we’ve been working on in a spirit of partnership to try to figure out how can we really move the needle for both companies over time and distance. And so I think it’s the right start between us and a partner like Pulte, where we can help them in ways that they can be, as Ryan mentioned on his call, a little bit more aggressive maybe on some bigger parcels. And we – and they can certainly help us and that we can have a partner who’s an expert at what they do, help us with future delivery pipelines in parts of the country that we can be a bit picky about. So is it replicable? Perhaps. Maybe also it can go beyond what we’ve already talked about. So I think we’re excited about it. It doesn’t preclude either company from doing business with other parties. But it’s meant to be strategic in nature. We’re going to collaborate and find ways to take these first 7,500 and hopefully grow it well beyond there.
Rich Hill: Great. Thank you, guys and congrats on continuing to put up some nice growth here.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Rich. Appreciate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jeff Spector: Good morning. Just a follow-up on the Pulte announcement. Can you discuss a little bit more how it will work? Are they building the homes specifically for rentals, meaning better materials or anything different than they normally do? And I guess, the margins – how does this exactly work for you?
Dallas Tanner: Well, first of all, they are really good at what they do generally, right? I mean they are the nation’s third largest homebuilder. They build tens of thousands of homes every year. I think what is strategic for us is to have the ability to appreciate and understand future pipeline and where some of those opportunities may be, to collaborate on floor plans and fit and finish standards that are incrementally helpful to us as a single-family rental operator. And I think more importantly, we’re bringing additional supply into the marketplace beyond what perhaps Pulte would do in a given year. This is meant to be incremental growth for both companies. So all that you described there really is some of the finishing details of why partnerships like this can make sense. And I think more importantly, it will kind of come in a variety of buckets. There will be neighborhoods where we’re buying homes that are part of a broader sales effort by Pulte. So our renters will have neighbors that own their homes, much like our portfolio exists today. There will be opportunities where we can cluster and do some things from an efficiency perspective that will allow us to have maybe better efficiency standards that could create margin expansion, to your earlier point. And then I think there will also be parts or entire parts of communities that can lend themselves to rental, which will allow us to test and try some different service standards for our residents over time and distance. All meant to be collaborative, all meant to be in the spirit of partnership with Pulte. And really not all that different from our approach with builders in the past, except that we can be in on the ground floor much earlier in a much bigger scale.
Jeff Spector: Okay, thank you. And then I know that you have several important data analytic initiatives. I just find it so interesting. Every quarter, we talked about increasing demand and average length of stay continues to increase. Anything else you can share with us what you’re learning on whether it’s your new customers or those that are staying through your data initiatives?
Charles Young: Yes, this is Charles. I mean what we’ve been able to track really from both marketing and data is what’s driving the demand for our homes. And as we talked about in previous calls, we’ve been serving our residents as they come in. And it’s interesting that, I said in my opening remarks, that they are looking for more space, about 27% are moving from cities to the suburbs. We’re also seeing a trend of people coming from out of state into our markets like Florida, to the Southeast, Atlanta, Carolinas, even into Texas coming out of some of the western states. So that data is all leading towards us seeing an uptick in our average length of stay that is moving. As we talked about, we expect to be around 3 years. And each month, each quarter is getting a little longer. So we continue to watch that data as well as other things that are making it – so we can make sure we’re creating great opportunity for our residents. Most in – foremost is it’s the great locations of our homes. And frankly, that is – the portfolio was built originally, and that’s what’s driving the demand, good school districts, safe neighborhoods of well-located homes.
Jeff Spector: Thanks. And then my last question, a follow-up, I guess, on that point is just I know location, of course, matters and it’s critical, but demand is strong. It seems like for single-family rentals throughout the country. Are there more markets you’re looking to enter?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, great question. I mean, look, if you look at our current footprint, we’re seeing household formation at almost 2.5x the U.S. average. So your point about demand is spot on. The country continues to move further south. And we’ve been pretty vocal about the fact that we would like to be in a few other markets, maybe over time. Salt Lake City would be a market that is one that we’ve looked at Austin. We’ve always liked, when we were in Nashville, we just didn’t love the product. So I do think there will be opportunities in the future, hopefully, that will allow us to maybe have a little bit more market expansion. But again, taking a step back, remember, our scale matters. It’s one of the three pillars we focus on from an investment perspective. And so expect us to continue to invest in the markets that we’re in and drive that additional scale, which will then enhance our overall return profile for shareholders.
Jeff Spector: Great. Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks.
Operator: Next question comes from Sam Choe of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sam Choe: Hi, good morning guys. Just going back to the Pulte relationship, so when you receive those new homes in future years, are you planning on receiving them in communities or is it more spread across select markets?
Dallas Tanner: It’s a combination of the two. So within a community, we may – and I’m just using an example of Pulte, were to build 600 or 800 homes in the community, we may be a buyer of 100 to 150 of those. And then there may be other communities where they can be clustered or spread out in much smaller numbers. It just depends on the opportunity set.
Ernie Freedman: Yes, Sam, what’s going to happen is Pulte will bring forward to us well before they move forward with the project, the opportunity. And we will sit down with them and will negotiate on a project-by-project basis, whether we’re interested and what makes sense for both parties in terms of how much we would participate in that project. And then that will just go into the pipeline for us. So you’re going to see things that are going to be delivered on a community-by-community basis. And over time, we will see a buildup in the various markets we’re working with that. But it’s very much on a project-by-project basis. It’s how the delivery schedule will be set.
Sam Choe: Got it. So I mean, I was just curious because like for those community-based acquisitions, I guess, could there be potential for amenity fees being incorporated in those?
Ernie Freedman: So what typically happens is in HI will be set up in a community. And if we’re a part of a community, then just like we have with HOAs currently, if they have amenities in our current homes across the portfolio that would be setup that way. If we were to buy an entire community, then something will be established with regards to that entire community that we’d be responsible for at that point.
Sam Choe: Got it. Okay, great color. One more for me, just looking at your two JVs, could you remind us how the portfolio construction differs for Rockpoint and Fannie?
Ernie Freedman: So the Fannie JV is very much of a JV that came – that’s a historical JV that came over from the merger. And that has homes in Nevada, California and Arizona. And it’s really kind of in its wind-down phase, but it will take a few years for that to happen. At this point, I think it’s less than 500 homes or around 500 homes. And each year, we’ve been selling between, say, 50 and 150 homes out of that. The Rockpoint JV, the geographies there will be more similar to the portfolio that we have today here in Invitation Homes. That JV is not going to focus on every market, the 16 markets that Invitation Homes invest in, but it’s going to focus on more between 8 to 10 markets. So that will be a little bit more of a geographically diverse portfolio. And that’s a growing portfolio, and that will continue to grow likely over the next year to 1.5 as we have a 3-year investment horizon for that JV.
Sam Choe: Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you guys.
Dallas Tanner: Yes.
Operator: The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you. Good morning out there.
Dallas Tanner: Hey, good morning, Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste: So, another one on the strategic partnership with Pulte, I was hoping you could discuss a bit more – provide a bit more color on some of the targeted yields or IRRs, thoughts on funding. And I understand your comments about scale. I guess I’m curious, would you be open to entering new markets via this partnership because their platform – I guess their footprint is a bit more expansive than yours.
Dallas Tanner: Yes. I mean, to answer your last question first, yes. I mean I think one of the benefits of this partnership will be we could look at new markets together and it would give us a meaningful approach to scale, which you know for us, Haendel, is really important. – to offer the suite of services like ProCare and some of the other benefits of being in our portfolio that are derived from that position of strength being scale. In terms of the return profile, it’s very similar in terms of how we’ve been buying for the last couple of years. We think that we can find what we think of as stabilized yields in the 5s in parts of the country that are – you’re going to lend themselves to that outperformance, both from a home price appreciation perspective as well as where we believe rate will go over time. I think that the one net benefit that we probably haven’t had historically would be just the new product side of it, right? With builder warranties and updated fit and finish standards that are exactly how we want them going in, that will be a strategic chip for us, so to speak, as we think about OpEx and CapEx over the long haul in some of those communities.
Haendel St. Juste: Fair enough. Appreciate that. I guess a question on California, your portfolio there. I think you’re at around 18%, 19% of NOI, I believe, still a pretty large exposure down from where it had been. But I’ve heard a number of others in resi land talk about culling portfolios there, getting some really good pricing. So I guess I’m curious about your long-term view on your California exposure. Are you perhaps open to actively culling and could that be a source of funding for perhaps some of the Pulte investments?
Dallas Tanner: Well, first, in terms of culling in California, we’ve done a little bit of it, right? When homes get really, really pricey, a lot of times, there is a higher and better use for that capital, to your point. And we will sell and recycle that capital in another part of the market where we can find a risk-adjusted return that makes sense. Taking a step back, though, we love being in California. We think it’s a differentiator. What we mentioned in our release, one of our first projects with Pulte looks like it’s going to be in Southern California. We want to continue to invest in California and create additional affordable housing solutions for those markets. And so there is a lot of benefits. Obviously, it’s got a great economy. And the Prop 13 advantages are really special in terms of how you can think about property tax growth and things like that. So all of that we do is a net positive. But again, to your point, sometimes it is a very expensive place from a real estate perspective and on occasion as things get too pricey, we have sold. But that’s – I wouldn’t say it’s a core focus for us by any stretch of the imagination right now.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Thanks. And lastly, if I could, just on the days to re-rent, Charles, kudos getting that number down more than perhaps I would have thought a year ago. So here you are sitting at 23 days in the quarter. I guess I’m curious overall, and not to sound like we’re not impressed, but how much better can that get? It sounds like you’ve mined out a lot of inefficiencies using technology really well. I guess I’m curious what the remaining opportunity and how do you get there? Thanks.
Charles Young: Hey, Haendel, good question. No, we’re really proud of the teams and what we’ve been able to do on the days of re-resident. We reduced at about 13 days quarter-over-quarter. We got here through a combination of great execution on reducing our turn times, keeping aged inventory down. And the majority, I brought it up in the comments, around pre-leasing. Technology has helped there. I think we’re driving towards what we hope is a new normal. I can’t predict how much lower we’re going to go, but we’re going to push. And I think it’s on consistently getting that pre-leasing done and using the technology there. We do have some markets, when you look, across 15 of our 16 markets are in the 20-day range, which is really impressive. And you have a couple of markets that are in the teens, again, high occupancy, low turnover, all of that leads towards it. So we’re in a really good environment, and we’re going to do our best to sustain if not get better. But it’s a constant work by the teams. They are doing a great job.
Haendel St. Juste: Fair enough. Thank you.
Charles Young: Thanks, Haendel.
Operator: The next question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Sorry if I missed this, but for the Pulte relationship, what’s the total capital outlay over those 7,500 homes?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. Nick, we haven’t disclosed that. We are looking at projects all across the country. So we could be at dine homes that are in the high $200,000 range up to the mid-400s, for instance, the deal of California is going to be at a higher price point. So we don’t know yet exactly what that’s going to be, but I think the way to get a good sense for it is take a look at our average home price that we’re purchasing today across our portfolio, and it’s going to be in that ballpark as we think about all the different markets we’re going to work with them on.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. That’s helpful. And then you mentioned the potential for margin expansion for some of the clustered homes. Can you try to frame that versus just a normal home within the portfolio?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. I think because – yes. I mean, because we have such good scale, we think it should be incremental. I think what’s going to get very interesting is we think about amenity packages, things we can do there, additional revenues we can potentially get by having the clustered homes. And of course, there could be some efficiencies. We don’t expect to change our operating model. I know some people in the build-to-rent world outside of the single-family world where they are hiring multifamily operators are putting people and staff on site. We’re not sure that’s going to be – that would be necessary, and we think that would be inefficient. So I think it’s just – it’s not going to be hundreds of basis points. It’s probably going to be in the 10s to maybe a little bit better than 10s of basis points, where we think with the clustered opportunities, it’s just going to overall enhance what we can do from an operating perspective.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Ernie Freedman: Thanks Nick.
Operator: The next question comes from Rich Hightower of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Rich Hightower: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking a couple of questions here. Just in – I’m looking at results for occupancy in the quarter and how strong that’s been. Is there an optimal level of occupancy that you’re targeting as you think about the strength in new lease growth as well? How do you sort of optimize those variables?
Charles Young: Yes. It’s Charles. It’s a constant balance. I mean the optimization is the right word. We have lots of really smart people, and our field teams on the ground working in tandem to try to find that right balance between occupancy, new lease rate growth, renewal rate growth. And we’re at that balance given the demand that we’re seeing for our product right now. I thought that we might be a little lower than 98%. I’m pleased that we ended the quarter at 98.3%. Seasonality would typically take us a little lower this time of year. You can see our new lease and renewal rent growth, we are trying to find that proper balance given that we ended the quarter a new lease at 13.8% and renewals at 5.8%. So we’re still kind of calculating in there, and we will see how it balances out. I expect that we might go down slightly on the occupancy side. But with the demand that we’re seeing and what we’re doing on the days to re-resident, as I talked about earlier, we’re controlling what we can control and the demand is there. So we will keep watching it. Again, this is a unique environment that we’re in and the teams are doing a really good job of executing right now.
Rich Hightower: Got it. Yes. It’s definitely a high-class problem.
Charles Young: Sure.
Rich Hightower: And then just a quick follow-up on renewals in Seattle, obviously, that’s sort of the outlier last quarter on the low side. Can you confirm that there are still regulatory caps in place? Or what’s the situation out there?
Charles Young: So there were regulatory caps for Q2, and you can see that in our number. As we’re going into Q3, they are starting to loosen, and into the fall, so you’ll start to see that come up. We’re trying to be thoughtful, and we’re watching it. There is also been kind of start to pull back and then move back and forth. Each of the states have been monitoring that. But we’re at a place now where we’re going out with more normal ads on our renewal side. So you’ll start to see that come up later in the year. We will see how it plays out.
Rich Hightower: Okay. Thanks, Charles.
Charles Young: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Hey, good morning everyone. [Technical Difficulty] It seems like those homes would just naturally have to be more suburban than the existing portfolio. I guess, first of all, is that correct? And then does it represent sort of a strategy change? And how does it affect the expectations for density and growth?
Dallas Tanner: No, on the strategy change. And I think the balance, if you look at where they build and develop, they do have a lot of infill projects. But I think there are some opportunities in the parts of markets where we already currently invest capital, that one of the first transactions that we put in contract with them is – lays over nicely with a bunch of stuff that we already own in Atlanta. And so no, it does not change the strategy shifts at all. I mean the reality is we want to continue to buy probably a little bit more expensive home that’s a little more infill in nature. There are certainly parts of markets where you are seeing the potential for high growth that could be a little bit more suburbanish. But at the end of the day, that’s not our model. We want to try to invest capital in parts of the country that are going to lend themselves to that continued outperformance. Keep that occupancy up to Charles just talked about. But I think more importantly, it’s evidenced in our lease rates. The real estate we own tends to be more infill along all those important factors like transportation, quarters, jobs and schools. And therein lies quite a bit of demand, so we are going to stick to that playbook.
Brad Heffern: Yes. Okay. Very clear. And then how incremental are these acquisitions? So obviously, you are not going to give ‘22 guidance, but is the ‘22 acquisition budget become $1.5 billion instead of $1 billion because of this deal or is there some overlap?
Ernie Freedman: No, it’s definitely incremental. But you are right, Brad, we can’t give guidance. What I would tell you is it depends on what the opportunity set is for all of our channels because we are location-specific channel agnostic. So, it’s a little bit hard to predict today what things may look like next year with regards to buying off the MLS, having – buying from the iBuyers and things like that. But this really is an incremental source for us. It’s not going to replace other things that are available to us.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then I apologize if I missed this in the prepared comments. But Charles, do you have any stats for blended lease growth in July or any other color you could give on those lines?
Charles Young: Yes. What I would do is we gave you – overall, Q2 was phenomenal, blended came in at 8.0, our new lease 13.8, renewals 5.8. We ended June or ended every quarter of the month accelerating. So, June ended at 16.2 on the new lease side, the renewals 6.0 and blended 8.8. What we are seeing in July, we are not all the way there yet, is further acceleration. The demand is still there, it’s healthy. And we are seeing a similar trend. So, we will see how the rest of the quarter shapes up, but it’s a good start to the second half of the year.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks a lot for the time. I wanted to stick with the conversation on scale and what it means for operating margins. But within the existing portfolio, Charles, as you look at your markets and maybe the smaller markets, are there still any markets where you know you could operate at meaningfully higher margins if you had 25%, 50% greater homes?
Charles Young: Yes. I mean we have some really great markets that Dallas and team are buying in the Denver, the Seattle, Dallas, even in the markets like Phoenix, where we have good scale, we want more. And so the way we have our operating model set up is we can add in these incremental homes and not necessarily have to add more headcount until we start to get significant size or add significantly more homes. So, it’s really a healthy model, and our teams know how to do it. It’s utilizing technology. It’s being thoughtful with our repair and maintenance and turn side, using the technology there. So, the markets where we are at 3,000, we would love to double. In Phoenix, we could add 2,000, 3,000 more. You can see it, which shows up in our Atlanta market. We are really performing well with 12,000 homes there, and we can add more there as well. But it’s a – that’s a good testament of where we get really efficient. It’s one of our more efficient markets in terms of headcount and how we are able to perform. And it’s showing up also in their occupancy and rate growth that they have been able to get this summer. So look, there is lots of markets that we are looking at, and Florida has been healthy for us as well. I know we are looking at some markets there in terms of expansion. So, we like where we are buying, and we think it all helps, especially as we continue to be thoughtful around how we load in technology and get more and more effective and efficient.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And then there is a few of those smaller metros, you referenced Denver and Seattle. Again, if you double those markets, are we talking another point in NOI margin, less, more, just any sensitivity would be helpful?
Ernie Freedman: Yes, John, it’s a good question. I think it’s – for us to quantify precisely is a little bit challenging. I think in the ballpark, like you said, I could certainly see that we could improve margins by a point or 2 points as we get more scale for sure.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Last question for me, it’s around policy risk. So, I know the sector has never had an easy battle on the public relations front, but it does seem to be getting worse in terms of media headlines and maybe some national government oversight. But at the local level, is there any policies coming down recently enacted or in the hopper that’s making your lives more difficult in buying homes?
Charles Young: No, not at the local level.
Dallas Tanner: No, John.
John Pawlowski: State national level?
Dallas Tanner: Okay, no. No in terms of buying, no. I mean, in terms of growth, no. It has more to do around just how you manage your properties and everything else. But no, on the growth side, there is nothing.
Q - John Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Keegan Carl of Berenberg. Please go ahead.
Keegan Carl: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I think first, can you just remind us how you determine what gets placed in the wholly owned bucket versus the Rockpoint JV when you are looking at specific markets that the JV is targeting?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. So, we start right there, Keegan, where we came into negotiation with the JV partners of what markets they were interested in investing in. And then the second step was we then talk about proportions of what assets will go wear. So, in markets like Atlanta, where we have a high concentration on our balance sheet, as we find – we agreed that as we sourced homes in markets like Atlanta, we would maybe do three homes out of four homes to the JV and the fourth home and go to the balance sheet. In markets where we are under-scaled and we were just kind of talking about on the last question, like Denver and Dallas, we go the opposite direction. We came to an agreement that we would do three out of four on the balance sheet versus the JV. And then as the local team source those homes, they have no idea where it’s going to go. And it’s really just an algorithm that runs behind the scenes that says, alright, if the Invitation Homes balance sheet got these – the three homes that just closed, the fourth home goes to the JV and then we just run the same thing. Most of the markets are 50-50. I just want to differentiate you understand how it works. But it really is just kind of behind the scenes and multiple closings happen on a day, we put them in alphabetical order. And we just – we closed them into each entity based on that.
Keegan Carl: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you. And I know this came down to scale in the past, but do you guys regret selling out of Nashville given the current market dynamics? And I know it was touched on earlier, but what would really drive the desire to reenter that market?
Dallas Tanner: Well, I mean taking a step back at Nashville, I think, was less than 1% of our overall revenue, so no regrets, because we didn’t love the product type. And we talked about at the time. We did really well on the sale there. We would like to be back in Nashville at some point with the right product. So, what would it take to get back there, I think just having enough scale and having a vision that it makes a ton of sense. Sometimes when you think about markets, with Nashville specifically, it’s a pretty small market from an MSA perspective, but very high growth. And there is challenges to getting the right kind of scale in the right parts of the market without being diligent in how you do it. So, hopefully, someday, we will get back into that market through a trade or an opportunity to enter. But there are some markets all around there like Charlotte and a few others that we have been able to really scale up instead of applying capital in Nashville.
Ernie Freedman: And Keegan, to Dallas’ point, we got a very nice price when we exited Nashville for product long-term. We have redeployed that capital in the markets that are growing faster than Nashville at very good price points at that time when we redeployed. So, it’s certainly worked out fine from us from a trade perspective.
Keegan Carl: Alright, great. Thanks for the time guys.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Please go ahead.
Sarah Obaidi: Hi. This is Sarah Obaidi on for Jade. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is does the Pulte agreement represent any shift in location strategy and can you speak to how those homes will sit with any broader footprint, and your comments on any locations you are targeting?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Those answers are in line with what we have said earlier on the call, which is no change in shift in terms of approach of where we are buying. A lot of the communities that we will be buying in lay up nicely relative to product we already own. I think the net benefit of having that new product, obviously, is that all of your hard fixtures and everything are brand new. You have got builder warranties and I think a partner that we can also work out floor plans and some of the other fit and finish standards that we care about, so all net benefits to our existing strategy.
Sarah Obaidi: Thanks. And my second question is how much of a priority is growing the investment management business? Is there a target for assets under management or aggregate number of homes?
Dallas Tanner: Look, we talked about the Rockpoint JV as one that was pretty opportunistic. And it’s got a limited shelf life to it in terms of the capital that has been committed to that opportunity set. But we are always going to look for opportunities to enhance shareholder returns if they make sense. You don’t compete with our core interest. So right, we don’t have a set target of what we would like to do. But Ernie and I, and we have talked about this over time and distance that there could be different vehicles that are available to us over time or different seasons of investing that could make sense in a JV structure, so.
Sarah Obaidi: That’s great. Thanks so much.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Ryan Gilbert of BTIG. Please go ahead.
Ryan Gilbert: Hi everyone. Thanks for the time. First question is for Charles. I appreciated your comments on July. Do you have a sense of where occupancy is shaking out in July? And I guess, more broadly, what’s your view on 2021 exhibiting typical seasonality versus seeing another extended leasing season like we saw in 2020?
Charles Young: Yes. Good questions. We ended on average Q2 at 98.3%. As I mentioned before, these summer months, you are typically going to see a little higher turnover and occupancy is going to come down. As I have been looking at it month-to-month, I think July will come down a little bit, but we are still going to be in 98%, so it’s still really healthy. We will see where further months go. If you think about seasonality, these are really healthy numbers that we are putting up for the summer. And I do expect that we are going to see some form of typical seasonality where it will slowdown in Q4. But we are coming off high numbers, so it’s a relative slowdown. And so we will see what that looks like. But at the end of the day, the holidays happen and all that will be there and I think it is going to – you are not going to have people moving as much. So, you will have a little bit of a slowdown, but we are coming off a really nice basis relatively.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay, got it. And then second question is on expenses. I appreciate that lower turnover, lower days to re-resident is really helping out on the controllable expense side. Do you have a sense of what the underlying material and labor inflation is in controllable expenses?
Charles Young: Yes. We are watching it. We are not immune to what’s going on in the market from both the material and labor side. It’s part of the market. So, we are looking at that. We were – it’s market-by-market as well. And we have seen a little bit of the staffing challenges and demand for our talented folks. So, as you – we have given our kind of guidance change. Any of those costs are baked into those – into our guidance at this point. So, we will continue to monitor if it ends up being material. But if you look at it, we have put up good numbers to-date, things are trending well. But it’s something to pay attention to, not only for the second half of the year, but going into next year.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. Do you have a sense of the magnitude? Maybe just a very broad range would be helpful.
Charles Young: It’s hard to tell. It’s coming from different places when you think about materials. Our procurement staff is amazing. And so we are able to buy from a national level using our scale. So, that helps us. So, that’s going to mitigate some of it. And then at a local level, it really kind of comes down to what’s our staff turnover. We have seen a little bit, but nothing that’s out of the ordinary during the summer months. So, it’s hard to quantify it. I wish I could give you that, but it’s hard to put specific numbers on it. But right now, it’s not having a material impact when you think about what we put out for our guidance change.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay, great. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Dennis McGill of Zelman. Please go ahead.
Dennis McGill: Hi. Thank you, guys. First question, just on the Pulte arrangement on pricing, at what point in the process do you negotiate price or how is price negotiated? And is there any point where that would change dependent on market conditions?
Dallas Tanner: As Ernie kind of talked about before, Dennis, we look at these projects on a project-by-project basis. And our teams are able to negotiate directly with Pulte on each of those upfront. So that is, I think, a really simple and clean way of doing this, where it’s on a project-by-project basis. And the teams have a familiarity with each other. They know what kind of product we are going to want to look at, what kind of submarkets make the most sense for our business. So, that’s already kind of been figured out. And it obviously just gets smoother, the more you do these repetitions together between the two companies. So, that’s how it exists today.
Dennis McGill: Right. And I guess to the degree that market shifts one way or the other, does that price just remain fixed or is there a sensitivity to the market?
Dallas Tanner: Without getting into the details, no, I mean, we look at being fair to both parties and making sure that we have structures in place that represent that, so.
Dennis McGill: Okay, got it. Second question, on the acquisitions in the quarter, both wholly-owned and joint venture, can you give us a sense of how that breaks down by channel?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Plus or minus, majority of this quarter was one-off. We talked about this in the first quarter call that we would expect velocity to pick up through the latter part of the year. And second quarter was much bigger than first. And just a little bit of a heads up, July is looking really healthy, we will probably be north of $200 million for just a month. So, we would expect the third quarter to be pretty strong as well. So, majority of which is still just kind of one-off acquisitions, either off-market through MLS or some of our local channels.
Dennis McGill: And so that would exclude new and iBuying as well?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. I mean…
Dennis McGill: Those are small.
Dallas Tanner: Yes, we had a little bit of it. I would say 80%, 90% of second quarter was basically one-off transactions.
Dennis McGill: Okay. Perfect. And then just last one, I guess, as you kind of listen through all the data points and understand how robust everything is, it’s easy to see how strong the business is. But when you look out over the next 12 months, 18 months and think about risks that you need to be mindful of what comes to mind for you running the company and trying to balance kind of opportunity versus the unexpected risks?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, I think we have talked about a couple of them on the call. Charles and their team are doing a great job of trying to stay ahead of procurement cost, cost of goods sold, some of the volatility that’s kind of happened over the last year with the supply chain has been tricky to navigate. I think we have done a really good job of it, but it’s caused us to think about how do we hedge some of those risks in the future differently. We obviously worry about public perception and some of the false narrative that’s out there around what companies like ours are doing. Our teams have done a fantastic job of really navigating the pandemic, working with residents and making sure that we stay apprised of their needs. But I think lastly, we want to make sure that at the local level, state levels, we are pretty active in the conversations around housing opportunity and what it is that we do. California is always a little bit tricky. Mark and his team do a good job of staying in front of the legislative issues that happened there at the state level. But it feels like we are always kind of moving around between what states doing what and how and why. And those are kind of the things that we really want to stay ahead of. Because it’s – every market behaves a little bit differently, both with the product that we buy, how we operate it and then what some of the other kind of market-driven dynamics are. And so I think those are the things that we spend a lot of time as a management team talking about and trying to make sure that we stay apprised of on an – apprised on an operational perspective. But we don’t want to get comfortable. I want to be really clear like we want to continue to grow the business. We want to find ways to continue to innovate for the resident experience. And that’s really more, I think, what we spend time worrying about is how do we not get flat and make sure that we are still pushing ourselves to bring the best service and quality standards to the resident.
Dennis McGill: Thanks for that. Good luck guys.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks Dennis.
Operator: The next question comes from Tyler Batory of Janney. Please go ahead.
Tyler Batory: Hi, good morning. I appreciate it. I will stick to one question here. Acquisition cap rates, any movements one way or the other, just given where home prices are and some of the competition that’s out there? And any perspective on what yields might look like the rest of the year?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. We signaled on this a little bit last quarter on our call. We have traditionally kind of been in the mid-5s with the products we are buying. With some of the price increase, we have seen that kind of go into kind of the low to mid-5s. So, I think we have been somewhere around 5.2, 5.25 on a blended basis of what we have been buying in Q2. And that feels like the market right now. Fortunately, we are seeing a little bit more supply creep back into the marketplace. You are seeing listings – new listings kind of creep up and – but we don’t expect like some drastic change in supply. I would expect us to be hopefully around a 5 cap or a little bit better if we stayed at this pace.
Tyler Batory: Okay, excellent. I appreciate the detail. Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you. We appreciate everybody’s support, and we look forward to talking to everybody next quarter, hopefully getting to see a few of you in the fall. Thanks again.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. And you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-29 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Invitation Homes First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode at this time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Scott McLaughlin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Scott McLaughlin: Good morning and welcome. Joining me today from Invitation Homes are Dallas Tanner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer. During this call, we may reference our first quarter 2021 earnings press release and supplemental information. This document was issued yesterday after the market closed and is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Certain statements we make during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and supplemental information, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that let me turn the call over to Dallas.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We hope you are well and have continued to stay safe. We're off to a great start in 2021 with strong fundamentals, steady progress on our growth objectives, and great positioning for the peak leasing season. We are seeing record demand for our homes and we're executing well to turn that into record high occupancy and capture market-driven rental rate growth. We are also driving growth through acquisitions as our tried and true multichannel platform and local investment professionals continue to successfully source accretive opportunities as home price appreciation accelerates. Before turning it over to Charles and Ernie, I'd like to elaborate on the macroeconomic opportunity we see and the strategy we've put in place to capitalize on it. To begin, we believe the tailwinds driving growth in our business and markets are stronger than they've ever been. The supply of single-family homes remain well short of growing demand, while the leading edge of the millennial generation is just starting to reach our average resident age of 39 years. As this large cohort of the population may increasingly seek out single-family homes, we anticipate that their preference for and participation in the subscription economy could continue to drive them toward home rental versus home ownership, further extending demand growth for our product in the years ahead. We also expect continued benefits from our homes compatibility with the work-from-home lifestyle and the relative affordability of our square footage compared to other housing options. We believe these benefits are magnified in a world where people rethink the way they use space to work and play. In addition, we're seeing strong continued growth in household formation within our markets, which are benefiting from the southward migration of the U.S. population. Put simply, we believe the growth we've experienced to date is only the beginning. And we're as bullish as ever about the fundamental outlook for single-family rentals in our markets. These positive industry dynamics are not only a strong backdrop for organic growth, but also enhance the investment thesis for external growth as we look to grow in a very disciplined way. Of the 16 million single-family rental homes in the U.S. today, less than 2% are institutionally owned. We are hearing from our residents and seeing in our results that there is high demand for an increased number of professionally managed single-family rental homes. There is an opportunity and a need for the industry to grow. And with our best-in-class platform people and scale, we believe we are the best prepared to invest and execute to capture these growth opportunities ahead. In this regard, our growth strategy is comprised of two parallel avenues. The first is through acquisitions. The second is through enhancing the resident experience. Let me walk you through both of these in a bit more detail. First, I'll cover growing our portfolio. As we've stated, we've projected acquisitions of at least $1 billion in homes this year and I'm pleased to report, we are off to a great start. During the first quarter, we added 696 homes to our portfolio including 295 in our joint venture. Our proven multichannel approach to acquisitions driven by our proprietary AcquisitionIQ technology and in-house local investment experts enable us to remain nimble and source robust acquisition volume, while maintaining discipline around location, quality and risk-adjusted returns. Second, I'd like to talk about our plans to further enhance the resident experience. Our residents look to us not only for shelter, but also a worry-free leasing lifestyle. Our ProCare service offers proactive maintenance to keep our residents' homes in excellent condition.  Our Smart Home technology makes it easy to manage the features and utilities in their homes. And our filter delivery service make it more convenient for residents to maintain air quality and energy efficiency of their homes. We recently rolled out our pest control services and we'll launch a landscaping pilot program in select markets next month. All of these items are provided at an additional monthly cost. And both our resident survey data and the number of residents signing up for these services tell us that we're delivering these services that residents want in order to simplify their lives. We estimate we're over halfway to our expectation to reach approximately $15 million to $30 million in run rate annual ancillary income by the end of 2022. As we grow, we also remain focused on ESG including added attention to the environmental performance of our homes. For example, we recently piloted a program designed to help our residents optimize their energy usage while reducing peak energy demand. The software-based system is integrated into our Smart Home technology and allows our residents to save hundreds of dollars a year in utility costs, in addition to consuming less energy. We also recently launched our Green Spaces community program in which we select philanthropic and volunteer opportunities to improve outdoor spaces in our neighborhoods. We kicked off the program earlier this month with support for the Hawes Trail Alliance in Mesa Arizona, where members of our executive team joined dozens of local associates and community partners to create new hiking and biking trails for our residents and for our neighbors to enjoy. I'd also like to take a minute and comment on our recent investment-grade ratings announcement. We are very pleased that the rating agencies recognize the strength of our platform and our team and the safety of our balance sheet. This represents the achievement of a long-stated goal since our IPO and Ernie will provide more commentary on what it means for our company going forward. In closing, we're proud of the accomplishments we've made this quarter and are excited by the opportunities we have to grow both internally and externally using our strengths, scale and operational excellence to continue leading the single-family sector. I'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work in serving our residents with genuine care and getting us off to a strong start this year. With that I'll turn it over to Charles to talk further about our operational results.
Charles Young : Thanks, Dallas. Let me start by recognizing our teams for another quarter of exceptional care to our residents. Our approach is straightforward: we offer quality homes and easy process and friendly service. And when we execute well as we did this past quarter, it reflects in several ways. Let me tell you about four of these. First our residents continue to stay with us longer. During the first quarter, trailing 12-month same-store turnover decreased another 100 basis points to 25.3%. The second point is our ability to lease faster. Our days to re-resident dropped to 29 days for the first quarter down over 20 days from the prior year. Today over half of our new leases are being signed before a new resident has even seen their new home in person. This along with lower turnover helped drive our same-store average occupancy to 98.4% during the quarter 170 basis points improvement over prior year. The third point is our rental rate growth. New lease rate growth accelerated to 7.9% in the first quarter, up 610 basis points year-over-year, while the rate on renewals grew 4.4% in the first quarter. This brought same-store blended rental rate growth for the quarter to 5.4%, up 200 basis points year-over-year. The fourth and final point is resident satisfaction. As a reminder, we receive roughly 60,000 resident surveys each year and these continue to indicate record-high satisfaction rates. Our residents are particularly pleased with how we're using technology to add flexibility, convenience and time-saving benefits to their lives.  For example, we recently rolled out an app to make service requests and appointments easier for our residents and more efficient for us. And we continue to install our Smart Home suite throughout our portfolio while also considering new ways we can continue to improve the resident experience. All of this leads to our same-store NOI growth in the first quarter of 4.4% year-over-year. This is comprised of same-store core revenue growth at 2.2% as well as a 2.2% reduction in same-store core expenses. On the revenue side, cash collections improved in the first quarter 98% of our historical average as we continue to work with residents to offer flexible solutions for those experiencing hardship. Lower expenses were mostly result of double-digit percentage drops in nearly all of our controllable expenses. As Dallas mentioned, we are now in our peak leasing season and demand for single-family housing is as strong as we've ever seen. This reflects in the current dynamics in the marketplace and is certainly impacting how we think about renewals and new lease rates. In summary, we remain in a strong position to continue delivering on our resident service and operational excellence and to capture the robust demand we're seeing across our markets. Many thanks again to our team for the genuine care they provide to our residents each and every day. That concludes my remarks. I'll pass it along to Ernie.
Ernie Freedman : Thank you, Charles. Today I'll cover the following topics: first, our recent announcements of our investment-grade ratings; second, acquisition and disposition activity; and third, our financial results and the increase to guidance we announced last night. Last week we announced that both Fitch and Standard & Poor's have rated us investment grade. And this week Moody's has as well. This recognition marks an important milestone for Invitation Homes. We believe it affirms our strong and flexible balance sheet and should also offer us improved access to additional forms of cost-effective capital, when we look to refinance future debt maturities. In the meantime, we anticipate the investment-grade ratings will reduce our annualized interest costs on our credit facility by approximately $0.03 per share. With this objective now complete we remain committed to: one, proactively managing our maturity ladder, which today, other than our convertible notes has no maturities prior to December 2024; two, continuing to focus on lowering our overall leverage to our long-term target of 5.5 to six times net debt-to-EBITDA; and three, over time transitioning more of our borrowings into unsecured financings. As for the current status of our balance sheet at March 31, our overall liquidity at quarter end was approximately $1.2 billion from unrestricted cash and revolver capacity. Net debt-to-EBITDA also declined from 7.3 times to 7.1 times during the quarter. Regarding our investment activity we purchased 696 homes during the first quarter for $233 million. 401 of these homes were wholly owned acquisitions for $138 million and 295 were bought by the JV for $95 million. Acquisition cap rates remain in the mid-5s. We also sold 248 wholly owned homes for $75 million. Last up our financial results. Core FFO per share increased 4.5%, year-over-year to $0.36, primarily due to higher occupancy, lower controllable expenses and turnover. AFFO per share increased 6.8% year-over-year to $0.31. As a result of our execution to date, including the benefit of the earn-in of stronger leasing activity achieved during the first quarter and anticipated activity in April and May, we are raising our full year 2021 same-store NOI growth guidance by 75 basis points to a range of 3.75% to 4.75%. This increase includes a 25 basis point increase in same-store core revenue growth in a range from 3.75% to 4.75% along with a 75 basis point reduction in same-store core expense growth guidance in a range from 3.75% to 4.75%. In addition, we expect interest expense savings as a result of our investment-grade ratings. In consideration of all these items, we are raising our full year 2021 core FFO per share and AFFO per share expectations by $0.03 at the midpoint, in a range from $1.34 to $1.42 for core FFO and in a range of $1.13 to $1.21 for AFFO. So in summary, 2021 is off to a strong start. We are particularly excited about our internal and external growth prospects, which we believe can widen our lead not only in the single-family rental business but among all housing providers. We believe our best-in-class locations, scale and local expertise differentiate us from our peers in our channel-agnostic location-specific external growth strategy now even better supported by our investment-grade balance sheet will propel us forward in helping us to deliver outsized returns. With that let's open up the line for Q&A.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead, sir.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Just given the elevated home price appreciation that we're seeing nationally is that having any impact on underwriting or initial yields on acquisitions?
Dallas Tanner: Hi, Nick, this is Dallas. We're definitely mindful of the fact that we're in a rising price environment and being pretty disciplined around, where we're buying and why given that we are seeing so much growth. We've been able to sustain that – our cap rates – call our stabilized cap rates in the low to mid-5s. Large part of that obviously is we're seeing the acceleration in rate alongside home price appreciation. It's typically a pretty good proxy. But it's certainly something we're mindful of because, not all trees grow to the sky and so we want to make sure that we're measured be smart about what we're buying, where we're allocating capital and sticking to really our core disciplines that Ernie talked about being really kind of channel-agnostic but hyper-focused on making sure we're in the right locations.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then congratulations on the investment-grade rating. As you move more towards that 5.5 to six times target will further investment-grade credit increases impact your interest rate on the line?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. We have – Nick, it's Ernie and the answer is – I want to thank you for mentioning that and I appreciate your congratulations too. And yes, we have a grid that's consistent with most companies in terms of investment-grade grid. So if we were to give you – able to go to BBB+, there'd be further increases in terms of the savings we have as well as if we would ever someday get into the A ranges. So, yeah, there is opportunity for us to have further savings going into the future.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Jeff Spector: Great. Good morning. And congratulations on the investment-grade ratings, first question is on, collection of late fees. It seems like, it's still dragging on same stores, but if you could just comment on that please, when you expect to start collecting?
Charles Young: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. This is Charles Young. In terms of late fees, Q1 was more of a transition period for us, trying to get back to our normal course and communicating with our residents. And so, today, as we move into April, we're running more like our historical structure. However, keep in mind that, we're still prohibited in a number of states of charging late fees. So while we're back to our normal structure, we're not going to be all the way back, until some of those rules are pulled back. And then, at the same time, we still are working with residents who have -- who may have a hardship and are willing to go on some type of arrangement with us. And so if they reach out, we'll do that. But in the meantime, I think you'll start to see us move, towards our typical late fee collection, throughout the year. It should increase as the rules evolve.
Jeff Spector: Thanks, Charles. And then, second question is around, some of the tailwinds mentioned. There still seems to be some investor concern that some of those could fade with re-openings. Can you provide any color on, what you're seeing in April, as we've seen some of the coastal areas re-open? How are your retention rates in April? Anything you can discuss or share with us, please?
Charles Young: Yeah. I think all indications are -- we're really in a strong position. As you can see from our results in Q1, we have a really favorable position with occupancy north of 98%, accelerating rent growth on new lease and renewals. And as you -- we have a few months -- few days left in April. But if you look at the numbers that we have, we're going to be north of 10% on the new lease growth, which is further acceleration from Q1 renewals in the kind of mid-5s, a blend around seven. We'll see where we settle out. But all of that is really healthy. And that's also with strong retention and renewal numbers. Again, as you go into peak season, it's a little seasonal. We're going to try to push rate and balance that appropriately. So you may see a little bit of pushdown on retention renewal, as things turn. But we're as strongly positioned, as I've seen in my career in single-family. So I'm really excited about, the opportunity going forward.
Jeff Spector: Great. Thank you.
Charles Young: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: The next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Rich Hill: Hey. Good morning guys. I wanted to talk about bad debt for a second. Bad debt was still a headwind in 1Q, which makes some sense. So two-part question, can you talk about -- and I think this is directed for you Ernie. But can you talk about what's embedded in your guide for the rest of the year for bad debt? And when we think that might switch to -- from a bad guy to a good guy?
Ernie Freedman: Yeah. Rich, I appreciate, you asking that. The answer is yes. The bad debt does continue to be a headwind. The comp gets a little bit easier as the year moves forward. But it's really -- we're on the path that we talked about on the last quarter though. On a sequential basis, we anticipate that bad debt will get a little bit better each quarter. But we still think, for instance in the second quarter, it's going to run similarly to what you saw in the first quarter, somewhere between 200 basis points and 250 basis points. Hopefully, we get into the mid-to-high-100s, as we get into the second half of the year. And so for the whole year, when you compare full year 2021 to full year 2020, we're still anticipating at the mid-point of our guidance that it's a bit of a headwind, but it does get better each quarter. But we clearly don't get back to historical numbers that we saw in 2019 of somewhere between 30 basis points and 40 basis points until sometime well into 2022.
Rich Hill: Okay. Helpful, hey, Dallas, I'm going to preface, what I'm about to say by giving you a caveat. This is especially annoying sell-side question. But walk us through why you're just not supposed to buy everything here. Some of your competitors are obviously being pretty aggressive with various different programs. We see a lot of new entrants in the space. There's tremendous tailwinds I recognize HPA is expensive. But -- and I fully appreciate the need to be prudent. But why not take your investment-grade bond rating, and just start buying as much as you can right now?
Dallas Tanner: I'll try not to give you an especially annoying answer, Rich. But I would just -- I would say a couple of things. I mean, look, we're investors for the most part across all cycles. We want to be smart about, when and where. We don't disagree that we have a pretty good cost of capital. So if things make sense, we would certainly want to try to find a way to lean in. But with that being said too, we're also seeing pricing, especially on stabilized portfolios in the marketplace, trading well beyond what someone would deem a retail value. We're seeing cap rates compress and kind of the stability of that cash flow being extremely appealing to investors. So we're just trying to really weigh that all out in our approach. Now, also, let's just be cognizant of the fact that, there's very limited supply right now. It is a tight supply environment, but we're active. And look we went into the year feeling like $200 million to $300 million a quarter was pretty rational in a base case scenario, where we could generate really strong risk-adjusted returns for the shareholders. And through the first quarter, we feel pretty good about that. We haven't done anything special yet this year. We haven't picked up any big bulk deal or some opportunity like that. So we did – we agree on the sense – or on the side of your question that we are in a favorable position. So if things become available to us, we're certainly going to try to be aggressive. But at the same time, we also don't want to be overly aggressive and dilute what is an exceptional portfolio with really, really strong operating metrics. I just want to echo what Charles said, which is in 10 years of running and being involved in this business, we've never seen fundamentals like this to your point Rich. So we want to really continue to execute on the operational side, continue to add to the balance sheet through growth, but really emphasize that ancillary part of our business, which our residents are continually opting into, because that will be an enduring income stream for the business over the long haul.
Rich Hill: Okay. Thank you, Dallas. Congrats on a good quarter.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks really appreciate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman. Please proceed.
Dennis McGill: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. Charles, you made a comment. I think you said that, the strength of the market is impacting, how you are thinking about new and renewals. And I just wanted to see, if you could elaborate on what you meant by that?
Charles Young: Oh, yeah. So as we look forward to peak season coming, we've been performing – the numbers we put up in Q1 are what we typically see in summer months when things are really strong. And so the position of our portfolio puts us in a really nice position. So when you think about our renewal ask out into the summer, we went out in May with an ask in the high six's. June we're asking around seven. In July, we're asking around eight. These are all on renewals, which is an indication of the healthy strength of our portfolio. And a lot of that is buoyed by our occupancy rate how we're executing the teams are doing a phenomenal job and the new lease rates that we're starting to see forward. And today as I mentioned, on the previous question that for April, we're north of 10% on new lease. So that gives us a lot of strength to think about how we want to go about positioning the portfolio and capturing the strong market that's out there.
Dennis McGill: So you just meant that, you're willing to be a little bit more aggressive than you normally would seasonally because of how robust occupancy is?
Charles Young: That's right.
Dennis McGill: Okay. Got it. And then Dallas on the acquisition side with the competitiveness out there, are you either forced to or more willing to take on homes that might require more upfront CapEx and utilize your redevelopment expertise on that to still achieve the same level of cap rate, or is that unchanged?
Dallas Tanner: No. I'd say, it's unchanged, Dennis. We're certainly not afraid of a project, if it's in a great location, but no our view on that hasn't changed at all.
Dennis McGill: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Dennis.
Operator: The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you, operator. So, good morning.
Dallas Tanner: Good morning.
Haendel St. Juste: I wanted to go back and ask the acquisition question – good morning – a slightly different way. Clearly, there's understanding that there's lots of competition tight supply you're being selective, but I guess I'm really wondering on getting at what's giving you the confidence to hit that $1 billion target for the year, right? We're off to a bit of a slower start in the first quarter than I would have thought. And given your comments about the market, I guess, I'm curious, is there anything special underway portfolios or anything meaningful under contract or LOI or something that's giving you a bit more confidence or something that could be helpful in us understanding the confidence that you're having in hitting that number?
Dallas Tanner: Yeah. Haendel, just for fun. $233 million is pretty close to $0.25 billion – 
Haendel St. Juste: Net is $150 million.
Dallas Tanner: That's okay. Well we never – we don't – we didn't ever talk about gross to net. But I would say this, a couple of things. Like I said, it was a pretty base case quarter for us. Going back to Q4 and even kind of pre-pandemic our kind of normalized run rate has been right around I would say, $250 million a quarter. That has some ebb and flow. I think in Q3 or Q4 of last year, we had a bigger quarter, because we had a few other little things kind of come into our opportunity set. We feel good about it. I mean, look we're in call it a less than five weeks of supply in all of our core markets right now just from an available inventory perspective. There's so much capital coming into the space that everything is pretty competitive. We've done a nice job of building up and starting to build a pipeline with a lot of our builder partners. So we'll continue to emphasize that as another channel for us as we continue to grow going forward. And we're likely to see some mini-bulk and call it other kind of consolidation opportunities over the next couple of years. Now, all that being aside, we still feel like we can grow to the tune of $1 billion a year. And remember, we report on closings. It doesn't necessarily talk about pipelines, but we're on a pace that we're really comfortable with right now.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Fair enough. And then on to the ancillary income, I appreciate some of the commentary there. I think you mentioned you're halfway to your run rate of ancillary income by year-end 2022. So pet care – I think you mentioned pest control. So what's next? And what – is that back half of this year more next year? So kind of curious on, what you've accomplished on that checklist and what's remaining on the ancillary income front? Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: Sure. So it goes back to our Investor Day a little over 1.5 years ago. We talked about wanting to be between $15 million and $30 million as a goal kind of by the end of three years. And remember back at that point, our ancillary revenue was basically zero. And we feel like we'll likely land somewhere between the mid and high point of that range over the next 18 months. But what we've done so far is really obviously revamped and enhanced our Smart Home technology platform and offering. Charles and the team have done a fantastic job of continually rolling out that product. That is now basically standard in our lease that we have people that are utilizing that service. We've added things around some enhancements to that profile, which we'll continue to adjust over the next 12 to 18 months. We've done things around filters and filter delivery services. That is now a standard feature that comes with all of our new lease signings and we're working on renewal structures through 2020 -- excuse me, 2021 as well. I talked about the fact that our pet program is being revamped through the end of 2021. That also includes a bit more of an enhancement around screening. We'll roll out -- we've rolled out and is rolling out across the country now our pest control partnership with Terminix. We've got a number of initiatives that are centered around landscaping that will start the pilot later this quarter. I would call most of that stuff table stakes. And then as part of our ancillary focus in creating a better mobile experience for our resident, we would view that kind of beyond those being kind of our core offerings that we'll continue to offer ancillary product offerings that are also both national and market-specific in the coming years. None of that is really weighed into our forecast for the next 18 months. So we view all of that as additional opportunity to grow our business and our footprint with the customer going forward.
Haendel St. Juste: That's helpful. Thank you. And one last one if I may. Just another one of these well maybe some possible answer, but like we have to ask it anyway. Occupancy and turnover hitting all-time best again. You're sitting here at 98.5%. You've got days to re-resident, I believe you said, 20 days in the quarter. So I'm not sure how much better that can get from that perspective. But just curious on how you're thinking about some of these levels you're hitting with occupancy and turnover. Is this as good as you ever thought you'd get? Can it be better? Just curious if there's anything -- any perspective you have to share on that.
Charles Young: Yes. I'm glad to jump in. Look, our teams are doing an unbelievable job at all levels. And it's been a very dynamic landscape. If you think about where we were a year ago to what the teams have been able to do and adjust in, we are controlling what we can control. The market is in our favor nice tailwinds. But in terms of our ability to control costs, move people in quickly, pre-lease homes by utilizing marketing and other tools as well as turning homes, rehabbing homes quickly, all those are just driving our numbers down. We were already moving down on days to re-resident prior to COVID and we continue to execute well. So look we're at heady numbers. But as I said before, we're going into the summer in really strong shape. And with the demand still there, we'll see where it ends and where -- how long it goes for. But the teams are ready and they're doing everything they can to make sure that we capture what's out there. Proud of them.
Haendel St. Juste: Great. Great. Thanks Charles. Thanks everyone.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please proceed.
Rich Hightower: Hey, good morning guys. I'll echo everyone else's congrats on a nice quarter in several respects. Ernie, just on the investment-grade rating, I think last quarter you talked about that being a distinct possibility later this year at the earliest. And so just maybe walk us through for a second, what specific factors changed in such a short period of time maybe versus the timing that was originally expected on that if you don't mind.
Ernie Freedman: Yes. Happy to Rich. You never know. It's not in our control completely obviously. It's up to the rating agencies. We started to build more confidence after we were able in December to close on our new credit facility, which really upsized the amount of unsecured financing we had. And earlier than that, we weren't certain we'd be able to upsize it as much as we were able to. So we were able to add another $1 billion of unsecured financings to pay off secured financings. And a couple of the agencies are very focused on how much unsecured you have versus secured. And then the other real question was Rich how are the agencies going to take to the current operating environment. Certainly the sector held up well during the pandemic, but we weren't sure how they would view things from a going-forward perspective. And so certainly I always try to err on the side of under-promising and over-delivering. But we felt good in engaging with the agencies later in December a little more informally that there might be a window for us to go forward here in the first quarter of 2021. We had some very good help from some advisers in the process as well and we decided it was the right time to try. And fortunately the agencies like the path we're on. They certainly recognize as you probably saw in the reports the strength of the industry, the strength of our company in particular from a credit perspective. And we were fortunate to get there. It's the second time they've taken the company through. So you never know exactly how that's going to go. And so that's why I want to make sure we're being cautious, but at the same time we had some optimism. And that's how we were able to get here maybe about a year earlier than we otherwise would have thought.
Rich Hightower: Okay, great. That's helpful color. For my second question, I know you've mentioned several times in the past, including on this call that, work-from-home is increasingly -- probably a net benefit for your business and your tenant base. But I'm just wondering maybe the flip side of that coin, as more and more companies are announcing starting to announce a return to office plan at some point later this year, clearly some portion of the workforce is going to have to be commuting into the office a certain number of days a week. And how does that change or factor into your underwriting criteria, in terms of geography and the distance from sort of the urban CBDs, respectively throughout the portfolio? And what's your comfort level or house view with the idea that more and more people might work-from-home permanently? And just how does that factor into the investment mix, if you don't mind?
Dallas Tanner : Yes. Good questions. So a couple of things I just want to touch on, Rich. First and foremost, let's go back to pre-pandemic. We were 97%-plus going into the pandemic. So, call it all, the macro tailwinds that center around millennials wanting flexible lifestyle, boomers that are preferential that are making some of these choices. That demand profile was in the business pre-pandemic. Your point around the work-from-home component and the balance of people going back to the office or staying home, we've certainly seen that in our survey data that one of the bigger drivers over the last year on our new leases and move-in that was being influenced was by people's desire to maybe have a bit more square footage because of the work-from-home component. So we view that as purely just a net positive for our business call it, beyond the 97%-plus pre-pandemic. I think for us as a company, in terms of how we position into that narrative, it will be important that we stay current in terms of where those trends are going and other things that we can do that offer that flexibility. Charles and his team look at a number of these things, both from how we rehab a home, fit and finish standards. Certain offerings we can do with some of our partners in the marketplace whether it’d be Home Depot or office furniture companies, et cetera, where we can drive additional synergies for the resident experience. I think that's the key thing here. The occupancy was there pre-pandemic. The demand was there pre-pandemic, but how do we continue to capitalize on that theme, if it stays relevant for our business going forward.
Rich Hightower: Okay. Thanks, Dallas. Maybe just to drill down on one aspect of the question here. I mean, if increasing work-from-home is part of the house view of the business' strategy going forward, I mean are you increasingly comfortable acquiring homes farther outside the urban CBD? And does that open up investment opportunities that maybe you wouldn't have thought about if we were having this conversation two years ago? Can you go further and further out?
Dallas Tanner: I mean not so much from our current vantage point or our view. Guys remember, at the end of the day, we're total return investors. So if the work-from-home component started to drive value in those neighborhoods that were much further out companies might look at it. But we all know how this tends to play out. The pendulum swings one way and then it starts to swing the other. I think we've always prided ourselves on being more focused on buying infill product, higher demand factors that are driving to that ultimate experience. And it centers around school districts and transportation corridors that go well beyond just whether you work-from-home or not. So, all of those demand factors Rich, from our current view aren't changing. We would view our approach in allocating capital as being -- as continuing to be very deliberate in where we invest capital and why. And so far, on a risk-adjusted basis, we're not seeing anything that's telling us to go further out.
Rich Hightower: Got it. Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed.
John Pawlowski: Hey, thanks for the time. Charles or Ernie, hoping you can provide some kind of details on the path for two drivers of the business as COVID impacts normalize. How does occupancy trend once you're able to move through evictions? And what's a reasonable trajectory of cost to maintain once turnover starts to pick up a little bit?
Charles Young: Yes. So first question, as we go into peak season, there's always seasonality around demand and turnover as well as occupancy. We're at that high 98%. I don't think we'll be here forever. But, given our turnover numbers, we were trending in the high 20s prior to the pandemic. We do think and expect that second half of the year we may see a little bit more turnover. But our execution on days to re-resident should mitigate that. So I think we'll settle somewhere in the 97% -- mid-97% high 97%. But at the same time, we're going to capture with the demand that's out there. With that comes -- what we're seeing is really high demand for our homes in locations, as Dallas was talking about and we're able to capture that in the rent growth. So, our investment management team and ops team have always tried to optimize for the environment and they're doing that right now. And as things change we'll do the same. But our general execution with days to re-resident in Q1 of 29 days, that's really phenomenal. That's down 20 days. We're keeping that going. And at the end of the day, I think we're going to end up in a kind of solid position that captures the market.
Ernie Freedman: And John, on the cost to maintain question that you had, yes, we certainly are seeing some positive impacts with the low turnover in our overall cost to maintain. As a reminder, in our cost to maintain numbers, the repairs and maintenance of our homes is roughly about two-thirds of that cost and about one-third of that cost is turnover. It's actually a little bit -- it's changed a little bit because the turnover is lower at this point. Our guidance does assume that in the second half of the year we get to a higher turnover number, as we're able to work through some of the challenges we have in the portfolio. But we think on a long-term basis, we kind of normalize back to the kind of what we saw in the 2019 range, which is probably between around $3,000 maybe $3,100 per door. But of course, that grows with inflation, John. So if you're indexing back to 2019, you have to grow that with inflation for two or three years and once we get back to a more normalized environment. But we're not seeing any additional pressures, but you certainly will see some short-term pressures possibly, if turnover gets elevated in the second half of this year or into early part of next year, as we get back to a more normal operating environment.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Understood. And then just last one for me. Understood, bad debt is fairly stable across the portfolio. Charles, have you seeing any kind of sequential deterioration in payment trends across markets?
Charles Young: You broke up a little bit. But, no, you're asking about bad debt or collections, specifically within the markets?
John Pawlowski: Yes. Any sequential -- any market jumping out as deteriorating sequentially?
Charles Young: No. We really haven't seen any of that. There's more challenging markets that we've talked about in the past with California, a little bit of Chicago. But I can’t say that some of these third-party rental assistance programs are helping in those markets. And our teams are doing a great job of really advocating on behalf of our residents to try to get some of those rental assistance. And so some of that is starting to show up, but to your base question, no, we're not seeing any real sequential demand market by -- or region by region. And as we have looked at, in general, March was a good performance on collection. In April, we have a couple of days left, but we're coming in fairly strong as well.
John Pawlowski: All right. Great. Thanks for the time.
Charles Young: Thanks, John.
Operator: The next question comes from Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please proceed.
Sarah Obaidi: Hi. This is Sarah on for Jade. My first question is, with the surge and home price appreciation are you pursuing rent-to-own strategies with customers in any market?
Dallas Tanner: Not officially, no. What we've been doing is, fee-simple buying with anywhere from a one to two-year lease.
Sarah Obaidi: Thank you. And my second question is, what are the most promising offerings within ancillary revenues?
Dallas Tanner: Well, we think there's a few things that we do really well, including smart home technology that allows people to manage their home mobilely, both from ingress/egress issues, as well as managing their thermostat. We certainly are excited about some of these pilots I talked about earlier, that we think deliver in a better way on a worry-free leasing lifestyle. And things like landscape and being able to offload or ancillary product offerings, discounts with some of our biggest vendors are all going to add to that value experience for the customer. So I think, as we continue to find things that are sticky and maybe more importantly things that our customers can take with them. Our pest control partnership, for example, is a great avenue for that, where somebody comes into the portfolio, maybe stays with us for a couple of years, has a subscription-based service. As I mentioned before, the subscription economy that we're all part of. And then they take it with them, in their walk of life beyond maybe their stay with Invitation Homes. That continues to be an ancillary income generator for our business. So we're really excited about, not only piloting, but figuring out how to enhance some of those offerings, so that they can be perpetual income for the business going forward.
Sarah Obaidi: Got it. Thanks for taking my question.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC. Please proceed.
Brad Heffern: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Another question on the, sort of, acquisition angle. Has the sort of amount of work that you've had to put in to get a similar acquisition number changed over time? Like does the hit rate on the $233 million that you acquired this quarter, is that significantly lower than it has been in the past?
Dallas Tanner: It's been more or less about the same for the last couple of years. With certainly less supply, there's not as much to look at, albeit we do look at everything in the marketplaces. But it's generally been from a, call it, a macro perspective on supply, the same number for the last couple of years. And at this point, our data and our -- what we call our AcquisitionIQ technology, has become so much more sophisticated and robust, because every year it gets a year smarter. So well over, call it, a million-plus homes underwritten in the last 10 years. And our view on anything from a ZIP code to a submarket continues to evolve and get smarter and smarter with time and distance, as we've seen things happen, both at the marketplace and as we've seen things happen within our portfolio. So our ability to make quicker decisions has probably gotten faster, but the data continually enhances and makes that experience even better for underwriting team.
Brad Heffern: Yes. Okay. Got it. And then, just thinking about the guide, some of the commentary earlier about the renewal rates that you're asking in the coming months, I mean, it sounds really robust. So I'm curious how much of the April new lease growth of 10-plus or the July renewal of 8-plus, like, how much of that is actually in the guidance and how much of it's upside?
Ernest Freedman: Yes. I would say, Brad, if we're able to achieve close to those numbers that Charles said, there's always a little bit of a give and take on the renewal asks, so we don't get all the way to our number. But if we're able to continue with the numbers that we had in April, in those numbers that Charles laid out, there we'll certainly have an opportunity in toward the high end of our guidance range or maybe even a little bit better. But we'll just have to see how that plays out.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Keegan Carl with Berenberg. Please proceed.
Keegan Carl: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess to kind of take a different point of view from earlier questions, what's stopping you guys from, kind of, clearing out the bottom 2% to 5% of your portfolio that's performing maybe below average and then taking advantage of the current housing level and then kind of recycling that into markets you think you're going to perform better over time?
Dallas Tanner: That's a good question. And we have a pretty good track record of consistently culling the bottom 1% to 2% of our portfolio any given year. This year we're off to I would say a similar pace. I think we had what 200 -- how much do we have in dispositions?
Charles Young: 75 million.
Dallas Tanner: Yes, it was about $75 million about 250 homes in the first quarter. So at that run rate we would call it cull through 1% to 1.5% of our portfolio this year if my math is right in terms of say 1,000 sales or so on the current portfolio base. So you're right in that pricing is really good. Now taking a step back when you're in these types of moments you definitely can see a value proposition on maybe what your sale prices are, but you've got to weigh that out with some of the growth that we're seeing as well. So in our West Coast markets where in just the first quarter we're seeing new lease rate growth between 15% in Phoenix, 12% in Vegas and another 11% in Seattle it makes it hard to want to sell much of anything with this kind of momentum. And the portfolio as Ernie mentioned before has been pretty consistent in terms of operating expenses and our expectations around retention. So we're weighing that all out and we certainly would start to cull if we saw an area or a part of the market that we thought we could maximize pricing. But we've done quite a bit of selling in the last three years to five years as well to be prepared for this moment. We're really excited about how the portfolio is behaving and we'll look to maximize those returns going forward.
Keegan Carl: Got it. Thanks. And then specifically when looking at Florida have you guys experienced any significant insurance premium increases? And do you think this will kind of influence your decisions on transacting in the state going forward?
Ernie Freedman: Keegan, it's a great question. It's something we look at very, very carefully in the property insurance market, which has been very difficult for the last few years in the residential space. And I know the multifamily guys have been talking about insurance increases each of the last two years of anywhere between 20% and 40% for each year. We've actually had some pretty good luck down there because the risk of our assets are so much different because they're so spread out and each of our individual assets have an insurable value that's relatively small. It's not a large multifamily community it's not a large office building things like that. And so with that two years ago we had our insurance renewal. And our insurance renewals happen in March. So our March 2020 insurance renewal we actually had our rates flat across the portfolio. And this year they were only up about 7% or 8%. So over two years we're only up about 7% or 8% combined where I think, multifamily is up potentially 30 to 40 over that same period of time. It's something we watch really closely. It's something we're very cognizant of. But to-date we've been fortunate that we -- the property insurance market understands the risk profile of our portfolio is significantly different than anything else you would see in the commercial space and it's played out well for us.
Keegan Carl: Great. Thanks for your time, guys.
Ernie Freedman: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question is from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG. Please proceed.
Ryan Gilbert: Hi. Thanks, everyone. First question, Dallas I was hoping you could add some detail around just your acquisition channels in the quarter. Did the mix between channels change at all from prior quarters? And how are you thinking about the opportunity I guess between -- sourcing acquisition volume between the MLS channel, iBuyers, homebuilders or anywhere else you can buy homes?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Good question and it always varies quarter-to-quarter. So I certainly can report on what we did in the first quarter. As I mentioned before we had very little bulk in Q1. But we -- probably 80% of our homes came through what we would call traditional kind of one-off channels. We had call it 10% to 12% coming through our builder partners and another say 5% to 6% coming through iBuyer channels as well. So that can tend to vary based on any given quarter, kind of, the course of what we have going on whereas in Q4 it was roughly 30%, 40% that came through what we call mini-bulk just for some comparison. So I would call this like -- I hate to use the word vanilla, but it was kind of a pretty vanilla quarter nothing too exciting outside of just consistently buying one-off properties at the local level.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. And looking ahead has there been any change in deal flow, or how does the pipeline look by channel? Any changes?
Dallas Tanner: Without giving too much forward guidance, I would just say, we feel really good about where the pipeline is both from the partnerships I talked about earlier on the call with our builder partners as we look to expand those channels. We've talked about that for well over a year now. And those opportunities take time to come to fruition. We're really excited about the work that the team have been doing on some of the smaller -- really smaller consolidation opportunities that are out there. But again this is more of an aggregators environment right now with low interest rates and the amount of capital that's coming in the space. I think we will be really well-positioned over the next call it two years to five years for some good consolidation opportunities.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. Second question is on build-to-rent. We've heard a lot about it. I'm wondering if you're noticing an increase in competition from build-to-rent operators and if there's any markets you could where you're seeing maybe a bit of pressure on either turnover occupancy blended rent. I mean it doesn't seem like it's showing up in your quarterly numbers, but maybe any color you could provide would be helpful?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. No. So, good question. We don't get any pressure generally speaking from build-to-rent operators as they’re -- typically those neighborhoods are much further out relative to our portfolio. But we're always being approached by build-to-rent developers, other landowners to see if we'd be interested in parts or whole sections of communities. We apply really the same thinking that we do to buying an individual home which is, do we like that location and are we long-term believers in the fundamentals around that neighborhood? We certainly own parts or whole neighborhoods around different markets in the country, but generally they're much more infill in nature.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Ryan.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Rich Skidmore: Ernie just a quick follow-up on guidance just to make sure I understood correctly. You raised guidance by $0.03 and benefited from the IG rating by $0.03, but you took up same-store NOI which would probably add another couple of pennies. Just -- I'm just trying to make sure I understand the what might be the offset. Is it just the $0.03 on interest expense is an annualized number? Can you just clarify that?
Ernie Freedman: Yes that's exactly right. The $0.03 is an annualized numbers for the rest of the year. It's about $0.015 maybe a little bit better of benefit and the rest of the benefit comes from the increase in the same-store NOI that you called out you got it exactly right.
Rich Skidmore: Got it. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Sam Choe with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Sam Choe: Hi guys. Congrats on a great quarter. So my question is similar to I think the portfolio turn question you had before. I'm just looking at the blended rent spreads. And the Midwest has been lagging your -- the rest of the portfolio. And I know you've become and always been Sunbelt-focused. But kind of just wondering what your thought around that area is, and how it factors into your commuter location local strategy.
Ernie Freedman: Yes. I think – Sam, it's Ernie. Certainly we have a portfolio of 16 markets you're going to have your better-performing markets and your weaker-performing markets. And you've certainly seen we've had outsized sales out of some of our weaker-performing markets. But even our weakest-performing markets are doing pretty darn well. And we're talking about some record high numbers we're seeing across the portfolio that the markets that may be lagging a little bit are still putting up really solid numbers. But we'll certainly look at the opportunity. And if it makes sense to cull a few more homes because it's a really new time and a unique time in the market we're real estate investors first and we'll certainly consider that. But we also have to weigh against that what additional home price appreciation or rental growth we may be giving up if we sell today versus selling sometimes in the future. But we do recognize there's a good opportunity and there's a good market out there. And as you guys have seen in the past we've done bulk transactions to other institutions more than half of our sales we've sold over 10,000 homes since we started and over half of our sales have been to other institutions. And I think everyone is aware there's certainly capital available, if we want to pursue that. And then the other half we've sold roughly on a one-off basis back into the end-user market. So it's a good observation that folks have had on the call today, as well as yourself and it's something we certainly will -- we think hard and long about.
Sam Choe: Got it. And then I want to touch again on the ancillary revenues. I mean the $15 million to $30 million, I mean that's helpful. Just wondering how much of the resident population do you think will pick that up? I know you guys probably did a lot of studies around this. So, just curious as to what you're expecting when you're kind of factoring that into guidance?
Ernie Freedman: Let me take a swing at that and let Charles way in. Look I think each one is going to be a little bit different. So as Dallas mentioned, the Smart Home device is going to be something that's mandatory going forward. So at some point that's going to get very close if not all the way to 100% compliance as leases turnover and people who are renewing add that to the program. Other things like pest control certainly will be more popular in certain parts of the country than others depending on just the nature of where they're at. Pets we think is universally will be accepted because pets are generally -- there's equal dispersion of pets throughout our entire portfolio. And in landscaping again, for some markets it's going to be more prevalent than in others. Some of our markets -- we're very cognizant of things like drought conditions and do a lot of hardscapes. So landscape is not going to be as prevalent in some of those markets Sam as it would be in other markets. So we do have a pretty good sense across the board on a product-by-product basis what that could look like. But the answers are going to range somewhere in the to 1/3 of the portfolio to maybe all the way up to 100% of the portfolio depending on the product.
Sam Choe: Okay. That’s helpful color. Thank you so much.
Ernie Freedman: Got it.
Operator: At this time I'm showing no further questioners in the queue and this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you. We appreciate everybody joining us today. We have a great business with excellent fundamentals. We wish you all the best. We look forward to seeing many of you soon. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you again for joining us today and we wish you all the best. We look forward to seeing you again soon.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-17 11:00:00) =====
Company Representatives: Dallas Tanner - President, Chief Executive Officer Ernie Freedman - Chief Financial Officer Charles Young - Chief Operating Officer Greg Van Winkle - Vice President of Corporate Strategy, Capital Markets, Investor Relations
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Invitation Homes Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode at this time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Greg Van Winkle, Vice President of Corporate Strategy, Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greg Van Winkle: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call.  On today's call from Invitation Homes are Dallas Tanner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer.  I'd like to point everyone to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings press release and supplemental information, which we may reference on today's call. This document can be found on the Investor Relations' section of our website at www.invh.com. I'd also like to inform you that certain statements made during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements.  We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2020 and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. During this call we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. We can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures and our earnings release and supplemental information, which are available on the Investor Relations' section of our website. I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dallas Tanner.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you, Greg. I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. It's an exciting time at Invitation Homes as we enter 2021 with positive momentum, accelerating fundamentals and the opportunity to grow our best in class platform.  We feel well positioned for another year of strong organic growth, at the same time we're ending the New Year more active in the acquisition market than we have been in years. We also see exciting opportunities in front of us to further elevate our resident experience.  Before discussing the path ahead though, I want to take a moment to reflect on the unique year we just completed. 2020 was the year in which the durability of our business was tested and validated and in which the value of our differentiated product, service and people resonated with residents and communities more than ever. I'd like to highlight a few of these accomplishments.  We achieved record high same-store occupancy that increased every month in 2020 and ended the year at 98.3%. We executed well to capture market rent growth, which accelerated to a high of 5% on a blended basis in the month of December. We maintained rent collections around 97% of our historical rate throughout the pandemic. As a result, we met the mid-point of our initial 2020 guidance, growing AFFO 4.6% despite the disruption in the world that was around us.  We also raised nearly $700 million of equity and formed a joint venture with a world-class partner to support external growth. With these tools, we ramped up acquisitions to our fastest pace since 2014, buying over $350 million of homes in the fourth quarter alone. At the same time, we decrease net debt to EBITDA in 2020 by almost a full turn.  Finally, of all of our 2020 accomplishments, I'm most proud of the positive impact we made in our communities. We served as a port in the storm for residents, delivering comfortable homes and genuine care when it mattered the most. We worked to create solutions for residents experiencing hardship. We kept our residents and associates safe by reacting quickly to enhanced safety protocols and leveraging the advantage of our virtual leasing and self-show technology, and in doing this we were able to achieve all time high resident satisfaction scores.  As proud as I am of our team for what we have accomplished together in 2020, I'm even more excited as I look ahead. Industry fundamentals are in our favor, with more and more of the millennial generation coming our way. COVID appears to have been beneficial for demand, but we believe its impact has simply been to accelerate a shift from denser urban housing to single family housing that was already poised to take place over the next many years. As such we believe it is quite possible that single family will hold on to the share gains that picked up in 2020.  Our homes compatibility with the work-from-home lifestyle and the relative affordability of our square footage when compared to other residential alternatives give us even greater conviction that we are favorably positioned for a world ahead and which people rethink the ways they use space to work and play. Put simply, we see ourselves as a solution to changing preferences, demographics and housing supply demand and balances for years to come.  In addition, we believe our differentiated locations, scale and local expertise give us an advantage in turning these favorable industry fundamentals into even better results for our residents and for our shareholders. One of the ways we’ll do that is by continuing to focus on the resident experience.  In 2020 we rolled-out new ancillary services for residents, including smart home enhancements, and a convenient HVAC filter delivery service. In 2021 we'll continue down the path toward expanding additional ancillary options.  We're also working to enhance the technology experience through which our associates deliver those services and through which our residents actually interact with Invitation Homes with a particular emphasis on web and mobile capability. On top of creating a better experience for residents, we're growing our portfolio to serve more residents and widen the scale advantages that allow us to serve residents efficiently.  In the fourth quarter of 2020, we purchased approximately 1,200 homes which is more homes that we have acquired in any quarter since the second quarter of 2014. I want to stress that we have elevated our acquisition pace while maintaining our underwriting discipline. We estimate a mid-5 stabilized cap rate on homes acquired in the fourth quarter consistent with our track record over the last several years.  We believe it continues to be a great time to grow the portfolio through our proprietary acquisition IQ Technology, local relationships and experience across multiple acquisition channels, and see the opportunity to acquire at least $1 billion of homes this year between our joint venture and a wholly owned portfolio.  In closing, I'm excited and optimistic about the future as we carry the strong momentum we generated in 2020 into the New Year. With record high occupancy, strong organic growth fundamentals, external growth in a high gear and initiatives in progress to enhance our resident experience, I'm thrilled with how we are positioned entering 2021. I want to say thank you to our exceptional associates for helping put us in this position. Their commitment to genuine care throughout the pandemic has been inspiring and it makes me feel even more confident about the heights we can reach together in our future.  With that, I'll turn it over to Charles Young, our Chief Operating Officer.
Charles Young: Thank you, Dallas. Before I jump into operational results, I want to thank our associates for the remarkable job they did in a year when we asked them to be nimbler than ever. Adapting quickly to change, we’re able to elevate our high level of resident care throughout the year and we drove strong results all the way through the finish line. I’ll elaborate on some of our operational achievement Dallas referenced in his remarks beginning with our leasing results.  Same-store turnover continued its favorable trend in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year 2020 turnover rate to 26.1% versus 29.7% in 2019. When residents did move out, we released homes significantly faster. Fourth quarter day three resident improved 22 days year-over-year bringing full year 2020 day three resident at 36 days versus 46 days in 2019.  As a result of these positive trends and turnover and day three residents, our e same-store occupancy approved sequentially in every month of 2020. We closed the year with fourth quarter same-store occupancy at our record high 98.1%, up 210 basis points year-over-year.  Furthermore, we're off to a great start in 2021, with January same-store occupancy at 98.4% or a 190 basis points above January 2020. At the same time, we seen rent growth continue to accelerate and the fourth quarter of 2020 marked our best quarter of the year. New lease rent growth, which we believe is most indicative of today's fundamentals accelerated to 6.9% in the fourth quarter, up 560 basis points year-over-year.  January new lease growth accelerated further to 7.3%. Renewal rents increased 3.8% in the fourth quarter and 4.2% in January. This brought same-store blended rent growth of 4.9% in the fourth quarter 5.2% for January, up 160 basis points and 230 basis points respectively versus the prior year.  Now I’ll turn to our same-store results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Same-store NOI growth of 4.3% in the fourth quarter brought our full year 2020 same-store NOI growth to 3.7%. Same-store core revenues in the fourth quarter grew 2% year-over-year. As a result of our strong occupancy increase and a 3.3% increase in average rental rate, gross rental revenues increased 5.7% year-over-year.  As expected, this increase was partially offset by two factors related to COVID-19. The first was an increase in bad debt from 0.3% of gross rental income in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 2.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, which had a 221 basis point impact on same-store core revenue growth in the quarter.  The second was a significant decrease and other property income which had 125 basis point impact on same-store core revenue growth for the quarter, primarily attributable to our non-enforcement and non-collection of late fees. This brought same-store core revenue growth to 2.8% for the full year 2020.  With respect to expenses, the freestanding nature of our assets continues to provide an advantage relative to other property types by allowing us to safely serve residents and maintain homes without incurring incremental COVID related expenses. In addition, reduced turnover resulting from strong demand for our homes with benefiting expenses. As a result, same store core expenses in the fourth quarter decreased 2.4% year-over-year, bringing full year 2020 same-store core expense growth to only 1%.  Next I’ll cover revenue collections which remain healthy even as we continue to offer flexible payment options to thousands of residents to meet their individual needs and circumstances. In the fourth quarter our cash collections totaled 96% of monthly billings, similar to our collection rate throughout the pandemic thus far and compared to pre-COVID average of 99%. We believe the sustained strength of our revenue collections is a testament to the quality of our resident base, which had an average income of approximately $110,000 across two wage earners per household, covering rent by almost 5x for move-ins in 2020.  Looking ahead, we have momentum on our side after a strong close to 2020. Our teams in the field are energized to continue raising the bar for resident service and operational excellence. As was the case last year, there are a number of unknowns with respect to how external factors will unfold in 2021, but we will remain nimble and to continue to drive the best possible outcomes for our residents and shareholders.  I'll now turn it over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today I will discuss the following topics, balance sheet and capital markets activity, investment activity, financial results and 2021 guidance.  I'll start with balance sheet where we further enhanced our debt maturity profile, debt composition and overall leverage through an active fourth quarter in the capital markets. In the quarter we issued approximately 6.5 million shares of stock to our ATM for gross proceeds of $186 million, which we used to acquire homes.  We also closed and upsized a $3.5 billion unsecured credit facility with more favorable pricing than our previous facility. The facility consisted of a $1 billion revolving line of credit that replaced our previous line of credit and a $2.5 billion term loan which replaced our previous $1.5 billion term loan and prepaid secured debt.  We're also proud to have included a sustainability component to our new credit facility whereby our revolver pricing will improve if we achieve certain ESG improvements over time as measured by a third party. As a result of these transactions, we have no debt other than convertible notes reaching final maturity before December 2024.  In addition, our unsecured debt as a percentage of total debt increased from 22% at September 30 to 35% at December 31, and the percentage of our homes that are unencumbered increased from 51% to 57%.  Overall liquidity at year-end was $1.2 billion from unrestricted cash and revolver capacity. Net-debt-to-EBITDA finished the year at 7.3x down from 8.1x at the beginning of the year and we remain committed to reducing leverage further.  Regarding investment activity, in the fourth quarter we acquired a total of 1197 homes for $361 million, using existing cash on our balance sheet and joint venture capital. 1057 of these homes were purchased for our wholly owned portfolio for $316 million and 140 were purchased in the JV for $45 million.  We also sold 277 homes from our wholly owned portfolio for $82 million. Included in this activity were two bulk acquisitions in Dallas and Phoenix that took place in the fourth quarter. In total the homes in these bulk transaction were acquired for $75 million at a 5.5% NOI yield on in-place rents, to which we see upside by bringing the homes onto our platform.  Next, I'll cover our financial results. Core FFO and AFFO per share in the fourth quarter were $0.32 and $0.27 per share respectively, bringing our full-year 2020 core FFO and AFFO to $1.28 and $1.08 per share.  Excluded from core FFO and AFFO was a $30 million unrealized gain that we recorded as a result of an increase in the value of our open door investment. Notably, despite the external factors that came into play, AFFO finished the year at the mid-point of our initial 2020 guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year.  Last thing I will cover is 2021 guidance. Dallas and Charles discussed, we believe we are favorably positioned for both organic and external growth. There remain many unknowns outside of our control related to the pandemic in how local, state and federal regulatory bodies may respond, but I’ll frame how we are thinking about the year at this point.  Let me start with revenue growth. We believe our record high occupancy and strong demand fundamentals position us favorably for rent growth in 2021. The biggest source of uncertainty, largely outside of our control remains our ability to collect rents and enforce the terms of our leases.  The mid-point of our guidance assumes that bad debt remains in the low to mid-2s as a percentage of gross rental income in the first half of 2021, and then improved in the second half of the year. If this were to play out, we would expect bad debt to be a slight drag on overall same store revenue growth for the full year 2021, but to have a positive impact in the second half of 2021. Taking each of these factors into account, we expect same-store core revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.5% for the full year.  Expense growth is likely to trend higher in 2021 than it did last year. As a reminder, 2020 benefited from lower turnover. While we expect turnover to remain low in a historical context due to continued strong demand, it is reasonable to expect some degree of higher turnover in 2021. Overall we expect same-store core expenses to grow 4.5% to 5.5% for the full year.  The midpoint of this guidance range assumes that higher year-over-year turnover has a 100 basis point negative impact on our same store core expense growth rate in 2021. This brings our expectation for same-store NOI growth to 3% to 4%.  From a timing perspective, we expect same store core revenue growth and NOI growth to be higher in the second half of the year than the first, primarily due to an improvement in bad debt in late fees, offset some by higher turnover expense. Specific to this year's first quarter, we would expect same-store core revenue growth to be more in-line with fourth quarter 2020 results since the first quarter 2020 results were not impacted by the pandemic.  Beyond same-store growth, there are a few other anticipated drivers of our 2021 results I'd like to address. First, we accelerated our acquisition pace in the second half of last year and expect earnings from those acquisitions to drive the increase in non-same store NOI contribution in 2021.  We also expect to remain a net acquirer in 2021. As fundamentals stand today, we see a path to acquiring at least $1 billion of home this year between the REIT and the JV and selling approximately $300 million of homes. We expect to have the opportunity to fund that level of acquisition activity with current cash-on-hand, cash from operations, disposition proceeds and JV capital.  Second, I would like to remind everyone that we funded a portion of our 2020 acquisitions with equity, which should result in a higher weighted average share count this year than in 2020. Year-end 2020 share count information could be found on Schedule 2(a) of our fourth quarter supplemental.  Finally, a quick note related to our recently formed joint venture. Beginning in 2021 we will report an additional revenue line item for joint venture fee income and another line item for our share of income from investments in unconsolidated JVs. For the purposes of core FFO and AFFO, we will capture our share of recurring JV cash flow in the same manner we do for our wholly owned portfolio.  In 2021 during the ramp up phase of our Rockpoint joint venture, we expect less than $0.001 per share contribution to core FFO and AFFO. Putting this all together, we expect full year 2021 core FFO per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.40 and AFFO per share in the range of $1.09 to $1.19, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 5% at the midpoints for each. As a result of anticipated growth in AFFO per share, we have increased our quarterly dividend by 13% to $0.17 per share.  Taking a step back, we are thrilled about the future of Invitation Homes. In our view, the single family rental sector is favorably positioned within the housing market and Invitation Homes is further differentiated by our best-in-class locations, scale and local expertise. We believe those advantages, coupled with a long runway of opportunity to grow scale and transform the resident experience will be a recipe for growth for years to come.  With that, let's open up the line for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Alua Askarbek from Bank of America, go ahead. 
Alua Askarbek : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions and holding the call despite all that's going on. Hope everyone is safe. But just to start off on that note, I wanted to talk a little bit about that cold front right now, and it seems like we're hearing a lot a lot about pipes bursting and plumbers are already expecting delays on this. I assume this was not part of the initial guidance, but could this bring expenses past the higher end or just I guess how are you guys thinking this will impact CapEx I mean this year. 
Ernie Freedman: Yeah, I appreciate the well wishes. This is Ernie, Alua, and it has been challenging in a lot of parts of the country for sure. The good news is we’ll have insurance coverage for this due to this one event, because it’s across multiple states and so we'll have a $250,000 deductible on it, but any damages beyond that will be able to cover by insurance.  We do take the first portion of losses in our insurance up to a certain amount. We’ve had a very good insurance year that expires in February of 2021. So overall we should be in a pretty good spot from that. There may be some minor things that flow through, that will be outside the insurance. Those were not considered in our guidance.  But that said, throughout the year, things do happen to pop-up and so our base budget has taken acceleration of some type of events happening, but we certainly did not specifically call out what was going on right now. But that's a long way of saying, I don't think this puts our expense guidance range in any kind of risk at this point. 
Alua Askarbek : Okay, great, thank you. And then I know you guys talked about your turnover expectations for this year remaining low, but maybe ticking-up from 2020. Have you guys seen any pick-up so far in January and February. Just kind of want to see if there is a little bit of a reversal in demand now that we're starting to see a little bit of normalcy? 
Charles Young : Yeah, no this is Charles. We haven't really seen any reversal of that trend to-date. We still see really healthy demand and our residents and our homes continue to want to stay there just given that pandemic is still going. Work-from-home dynamics are in place. We ended the Q4 as I mentioned at 26%. We do have a little higher number in there for the whole year, but in January and so far in February we're kind of trying to get that lower number which is a good sign, which has allowed us to stay kind of assertive on the revenue side, and you can see that on our new lease grow as well as some of our renewals growing. 
Alua Askarbek : Got it. And then sorry, just one quick follow up. What is the medium length of stay at this point and how did it compare to last year? 
Dallas Tanner: Yeah, that continues to grow for us, as the portfolio continues to season. In this last month it's now over 30 months. With our turnover as low as it is, we would expect it to continue to trend upward toward 35, 36 months by the end of the year. So yeah, we continue to see that people are staying as per lease, a second if not a third renewal. So our average lease term is about 15 to 16 months. 
Alua Askarbek : Got it! Thank you so much. 
Dallas Tanner: You're welcome. 
Operator: Our next question is from Sam Choe from Credit Suisse. Go ahead. 
Sam Choe : Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. I guess, well it’s good to see you guys ramp-up acquisition and as Dallas mentioned, I mean you guys have discipline in mind, maintaining that 5 part yield. But I mean, we are aware of the fact that it's a competitive housing market, where you kind of hear the stories of home builders over built – over bidding for homes, awaiting contingency. So I'm wondering, how are you guys thinking about your buy-box. Are you starting to, I mean I know that location matters for you, but are you guys starting to look at more of the peripheries to the markets you are looking at. 
Dallas Tanner: Good question. This is Dallas, Sam. First and foremost, it is a tight environment as you mentioned. But we still feel pretty confident in our ability to buy between say $200 million and $300 million a quarter, even in this existing environment. We wouldn’t have to change our buy-box to use your phrase in any sort of way. We are pretty disciplined around making sure that we're in parts of markets that lend themselves and some of that outperformance, we see in, our both new and renewal rates.  In terms of you know the work we're doing with partners and builders, you mentioned that's an area of focus. Historically we’ve been buying about 10% to 15% of our homes through builders. We're also seeing opportunities to roll-up and aggregate smaller portfolios. You saw us do a little bit of that in the fourth quarter. The good news on those, as you walk into stabilized cash flow day one, and we typically see some imbedded losses to least in those opportunities and so those will continue to be on our radar.  So we feel pretty confident at the beginning of this year that that run rate should stay pretty consistent and we’ll continue to work to find avenues and ways to maybe expand channels, not necessarily the box, but really keep focusing in on the parts of the country that we are active in, but just making sure that we are aligned with as many opportunities as possible. 
Sam Choe : Got it. Okay, I mean that makes sense. With that said, I mean the bulk opportunities I mean you did to this quarter. Was that more one-off in nature or could we see that kind of playing a factor in 2021 as well? 
Dallas Tanner: We have a good track record. You know at least a couple of times a year of rolling-up you know 200, 300 kind of home portfolios and I would expect that we’ll see more of those; just the people aggregating for the last five to eight years that have you know wanted to maybe harvest some gains are looking for other opportunities to deploy capital.  As you mentioned, it is kind of hard to grow scale unless you've got the infrastructure to do it. We are fortunate that we're you know local on the ground, so we get access to a lot of these opportunities in working direct with partners. So the two that we did in the fourth quarter, perfect example of those.  One of them was a competitive process, is the one at Phoenix and the one in Dallas, we've known the operator for a long period time; we're able to just get a transaction done. So those relationships are meaningful and they matter and it's a big focus for our teams in market. 
Sam Choe : Got it, alright, thank you so much guys. 
Dallas Tanner: Thanks 
Operator: Our next question is from Carl Keegan from Berenberg. Go ahead. 
Carl Keegan : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I know you touched on a little bit briefly, but I guess what are the expectations for seasonality going forward? Meaning the longer the pandemic persists, you see turnover trending lower. Is it fair to assume that less move outs and high demand will kind of diminish some of year’s path in the seasonality aspect? 
Charles Young : Yes, this is Charles. You know seasonality is a natural part of the business. However, with the pandemic we saw last year that those trends were disrupted by people working from home, uncertainty with school. We've returned to somewhat of a high demand environment, so it would be interesting to see how the summer comes. I think some of it is going to be based on what happens with the vaccine rollout, herd immunity and all that.  What we like is, you know we are seeing numbers in this time of year Q4 that are typical of our summer season. So the demand for our product is really high and we would expect that come summer we may end up in a similar circumstance where with maybe a little bit more turnover which is natural for the seasonality is a kind of higher turnover in Q2, Q3.  That being said, given that people are still looking for our market, you know they're moving to the states that we are in, we would expect that that demand will continue. Hard to predict, but we're watching it and right now we like the position that we are in with the rate growth on the new lease side and renewal side, both kind of improving and getting better. New lease side, this is the best we've seen in a Q4, since I've been in the business frankly.  So it'll be interesting to see how it plays out, but we think demand will still be high in the summer, especially if people are thinking about finally repositioning and thinking about schools for the fall. 
Carl Keegan : Got it. And if we don't mind pivoting a little bit, as my next question is on new lease growth. Obviously it continued to trend up. How sustainable do you guys think that this particularly in the Western U.S.? 
Dallas Tanner: Yeah, a big part of it has been our occupancy and you know I'll just step back and give our teams a shout-out. They’ve just done a phenomenal job in a changing landscape; I can't thank them enough. And when you look across our markets, almost every market’s at high 97% or 98% occupancy.  What that does is give us a position to have, a low supply of homes so we can push those markets, and then you get all the dynamics I just spoke about around people moving to – wanting space, wanting to get out of the urban cores and move to our homes.  So I think the west is continuing to drive your new lease growth in Phoenix of 50% in Q4. January continues the same, Vegas is real high, California new lease growth is near 10%. So if we keep executing the way we are, days of re-resident down, keep occupancy up, I think we'll be able to continue to push and we have high expectations going into the rest of the year. 
Carl Keegan : Alright, thank you, that’s it from me. 
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Joseph from Citi, go ahead. 
Nick Joseph : Thank you. Hope everyone is staying safe. On the $300 million of dispositions expected this year. Does that contemplate any market exits, any portfolio sales or is it more one off dispositions?
Dallas Tanner: Hey Nick! Dallas. No, it's just normal ordinary calling. We're not anticipating you know market exit discussions at all. 
Nick Joseph : Thanks, and then just as leverage has moved down Ernie, how are the conversations with the rating agencies going? Is there any update on the timing?
A - Ernie Freedman: Yeah Nick, we're feeling more and more opportunistic seeing where we're at and seeing how you know the business has done as well as it had in 2020. So I think we're going to be in a position, you know some time over the next few quarters to more formally engage, where I would have said you know maybe it would have been a year and a half to two years out, maybe a quarter or two ago.  It feels like we need to do a little bit better than that Nick, so I think 2021 will be a time for us to really figure out what’s the right timing to engage with the agencies and see if we can get there, because if the business is doing well and the metros continue to improve. So we're optimistic that we're on the right path and hopefully have you know better news about that in the next many quarters here. 
Nick Joseph : Which metrics still need some level of improvement or what's the focus on today?
A - Ernie Freedman: Yeah, you know I think with the credit facilities that we were able to recast in December Nick, we were able to get our unencumbered pool larger, which gets us really close to where the rating agencies would like us and importantly we pivoted more to unsecured financing; we've been mainly a secured borrower.  I think the one area where we're still maybe a little bit off is, I believe the rating agencies would like to see our net debt to EBITDA number in the sixes and I think we'll be able to show them and as a lot of you guys have in your model, show that we get into the sixes you know it’s not by – if we don't kiss the sixes by the end of this year, we’ll certainly be there next year I would expect, and so the question will be then, is that soon enough for them with the clear path.  You know fortunately I think we have a very clear path to demonstrate how we've done that; we've got a good track record and we've certainly been talking about wanting to have our net debt-to-EBITDA number in the low sixties as our target. So I think all that bears well for us and it’s just we’re getting one step closer each day to that number. 
Nick Joseph : Thanks.
A - Dallas Tanner: Thanks Nick. 
Operator: Our next question is from Alex Kalmus from Zelman & Associates, go ahead.
Alex Kalmus: Alright, thanks guys. Looking into the average price point per home this quarter on the acquisition front, it seems like the rock point JV homes were a higher value, like 15% over the wholly owned acquisitions. Is this emblematic of the strategy for the JV or do you expect this to revert to the mean later on.
A - Dallas Tanner: Alex, it’s a good question. It’s actually going to revert to the mean, because the type of buying we're doing in the JV is absolutely consistent with what we're doing with regards to the balance sheet.  What you see in the fourth quarter though is that the two bulk transactions brought our average price down. The homes we bought in Dallas, you know Dallas is a lower price point market for us anyway and what we bought there, as well as what we did with the Phoenix portfolio, if you were take out that you’d probably see. I don't have it in front of me, but I think the math would show you that we’d be right on top of each other with regards to what the JV bought versus what the balance sheet bought because of those bulk transactions. 
Alex Kalmus: Yeah, I got it, it makes sense. And on the – for move outs, obviously occupancy is extraordinarily high, but for the few that are moving out, do you have a sense where they're going? Are they requiring homes or are they moving out to apartments or other single family rentals? Do you keep track of that data?
Charles Young: Well, we have a – this is Charles. We track them without reason. We don't have specifically where they are going. You know we're going to in the future start to track kind of the addresses, the forwarding addresses.  You know the purchase for homes, the move our reasons have been in the mid-20’s, slightly up in Q4, but not material as you would expect with interest rates. You know overall I think the overall turnover number being so low, we're just not seeing a lot of move outs and there's no real drastic change from what it's been historically. So we'll continue to monitor it, but we're proud of what we've been able to do with the overall turn numbers. 
Alex Kalmus: Got it. And I guess that you’re not really seeing a lot of move outs through apartments, so that once the rental, a single family home that they are staying within that sort of style of living overall.
A - Dallas Tanner: Correct, correct. Yeah, it's pretty consistent that you know most people who move into our homes or out of our homes are you know coming from a single family residence or – and what we're seeing now, you know from our tracking of people who are moving into our homes, we are seeing a lot of people come out of the urban core to our suburban locations, in field locations and so you know we're not seeing people move out for that reason. In fact we’re up because people are trying to come to the single family, extra bedroom, work-from-home, backyard, all the kind of safe things that you get from a single family home in today's world.
Alex Kalmus: Great! Thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question is from Richard Hill from Morgan Stanley, go ahead.
Ron Kamdem: Hey, you got Ron Kamdem on for Richard Hill. Just two quick ones from me. Sticking with the acquisitions, maybe can you talk a little bit more about sort of the competition? Is it still sort of end user or your starting to see more institutional players coming in, and you know on the guidance for the $1 billion for 2021, is it fair to say that we’ve done without bulk acquisitions or it's sort of bulk acquisitions sort of embedded in that number? Thank. 
Dallas Tanner: Hey, yeah I think it's safe to say that that $1 billion number doesn't include a lot of bulk acquisitions in it and I think you know landscape is pretty similar to how it's been. It really last three or four years. The one exception might be that you just keep hearing about more capital wanting single family rental exposure, which we you know quite frankly view as a positive.  You know remember, there’s 6 million plus or minus transactions that happen in the U.S. around single family housing every year and so the SFR footprint is a very small percentage of those. It's still end users buying and selling homes in a vast majority of those transactions, so we wouldn’t expect it to really change all that much. I think if anything, a few more of these aggregators will lend themselves and some other opportunities for us down the road. 
Ron Kamdem: Great! My second question was just going back to sort of the same store revenue guidance. If I think about 4Q on a gross basis, portfolio has grown sort of 5.7 versus sort of the guide for 2021 of 4. Is it fair to say that the delta is really coming back to sort of the late fees and the bad debt headwinds that you mentioned in your opening comments? I’m just trying to get a sense of how much conservatism is baked into that, especially as we roll into the easier comp in the second half of the year. Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: Yeah, no Ron, it’s a good question and you're exactly right. When you look at what we've been able to do, you know occupancy gains as well as just rent achievement as Charles and the team kept putting up stronger and stronger numbers throughout the year on the renewal side and on the new lease side, you know the rental growth as we tailed into the last part of 2020 was like you said in the high fives.  Offsetting that unfortunate were you know bad debt comparisons to the prior year. We didn’t have the pandemic which you know was up a couple of 100 basis points and our other income being a drag down about 100 basis points as well. So that's how we ended up at 2% revenue growth. You know as we go out throughout 2021, we do expect sequentially that our bad debt number will come down each quarter from the prior quarter, but we just do think in the environment that we're in right now, we’re just a little bit uncertain and you still have you know the vaccine being rolled out; you don't have herd immunity yet and you know the regulatory environment does continue to move on us. You know the deadlines that were supposed to expire in December and January got pushed out appropriately and understandably because of the environment we’re in to later in the year.  We just think you know the appropriate thing from a guidance perspective and provide that detail in the prepared remarks is that we think, so that we think the first half of the year probably has you know bad debt number that's more like what you saw on the third and fourth quarter, which is in the low to mid-twos. Hopefully that's conservative and hopefully we do better, but we want to make sure people understood whether our guidance was coming in from the mid-point and then we started to see things return to getting better in the second half year, but to be clear, not back to what we saw pre-pandemic. Pre-pandemic we saw our bad debt numbers typically in the 40 basis points. We’re not anticipating that here in 2021. We certainly think it's going to get better in the second half of the year, but not back to those levels. It’ll just continue to improve. Then importantly when you're looking at our full year numbers Ron, you know don't forget the first quarter of 2020 was not impacted by the pandemic. We had a bad debt number in the high-30’s in terms of bips and again, based on what I said earlier, we’re expecting a much higher number here in the first quarter.  So then what you'll see is hopefully if the year plays out as per our guidance range at each month, which I mean, each quarter, you’ll see a better revenue growth number, because we’ll have any easier comp for bad debt, we’ll have an easier comp for other income and then we’ll continue to have the really strong earn-in from what's happening on the rental achievement side and then we'll eventually have a high level of occupancy like we had in 2020, you know hopefully carrying through for the most part in 2021. 
Ron Kamdem: Thank you for helping clear. Thanks so much.
A - Dallas Tanner: Got it, yeah. 
Operator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski from Green Street, go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Great, thanks. Ernie, maybe sticking with bad debt, just a very modest sequential uptick this quarter. Was that more regulate regulatory driven in California or did some other non-California markets kind of erode on the collection front?
Ernie Freedman: No, it’s a question John. We are seeing a little bit of deterioration in California; it’s only Southern California. Northern California has not been a challenge for us. That's been behaving like the average across the whole portfolio.  We did see some degradation in Southern Californian and then it’s like it’s just the earning overall across the board. In terms of things, you know we're slightly off. When you start talking about roundings and things, we’re less than 100 basis points different than what we saw in the third quarter. It's just a narrow gap in which we should round the numbers there. So I just think that we're kind of in an environment where we've kind of hit the point where every month we seem to collect somewhere between about 96% to 97%. You know some months it's just under 96%. We’ve got a couple of months it's been a little bit over 97%, but around in both cases 96% and 97% and that's been pretty steady for us really since July. It just kind of how it plays out you know month-by-month.  So we're not seeing any trouble spots, we don’t see anything that's really concerning and Charles and team are just doing a wonderful job working with residents, having contact with them and the only place where we're seeing a material variation from the mean, from the average is Southern California. 
John Pawlowski: Okay, understood. And then Charles or Ernie, obviously new lease spreads are fantastic. Just curious, the acceleration and revenue enhancing CapEx in recent years, can you give me a sense for how much benefit is flowing through the new lease figures from revenue enhancing CapEx?
Ernie Freedman: Yeah John, let me touch base with you offline to give you a more specific number. We're not doing a whole lot when you look at the grand scheme of it and the size of how big we are. So in my guess, it's probably maybe a tenth of a point to two-tenths of a point in terms of helping the new lease side. Let me go back and check my notes and we can – Greg and I can touch base with you offline to make sure I'm not speaking out of turn with them. 
John Pawlowski: Okay, thank you.
A - Dallas Tanner: Yes John.
Operator: Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho, go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste : Hey, good morning out there. Hope everyone's okay.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste : So, I guess first question or maybe for Charles on days to re-resident. I know the improvement there, I think you said 22 days in the fourth quarter versus fourth quarter of ‘19 and 13 days overall in 2020 versus 2019. I guess can you talk a bit about some of the drivers of that, what you've been able to perhaps do to perhaps help that, lower that number, and then sitting here in the mid-thirties, how much better do you think that can get and you're thinking here for 2021? Thanks. 
Charles Young : Hey Haendel, its Charles here, thanks for the question. First of all just to clarify, year-to-date we're down 10, not 13, so we probably ended up at 36 days in 2020 versus 46 days in 2019. A significant reduction and as you said Q4 was down 22.  You know the real impact has come from a combination of items. One is, reducing our turn times, which we brought down significantly at the start of 2020 from the high teens down to the low teens. 10 days in some markets, single digit in some markets. So we can keep that going and we have been looking at that as a key piece. We're not going to be able to get much lower there, but we can look at a day or two as we go. The other big piece that we found is really focusing in on aged inventory and that's been a big advantage of making sure that if something is aging, let's get the price right or check the asset, eyes on assets, make sure that it's going right.  The big piece that moved us this year also is focusing on pre-leasing, I think that's the opportunity going forward. So as you think through what we can do in 2021, we keep our occupancy at a healthy level, the demand continues to be strong the way that we're seeing it and we can market our properties you know effectively using virtual tours and other pieces and really being thoughtful around how do we try to show that home while its either being worked or at least have all the information up on the website while it's still in residence.  So when it moves out and we can turn it quickly, that'll get us into the teens on some of those days. So then you go back to making sure we average out the age inventory. We’ll see where we can go. We're looking to move it down this year and we'll see if we can get out of the thirties, but we got to stay – get in those low-thirties and stay there for a while and we'll continue to see what happens, but we have an opportunity to do even better than we did. The low hanging fruit is gone though, so you're not going to see another 10 day move, but we will continue to try to bring it down a day or two as we go. 
Haendel St. Juste : That's good color, that’s good color, thank you. And Dallas maybe one for you; certainly we’ve noted the – that the increased competition for acquisitions, the industry overall has obviously very good fundamentals, strong revenue NOI growth, there’s proof of concept in single family rental development and you've got an improved balance sheet here. Maybe not quite where you want it just yet, but I guess I’m curious on stepping back and thinking about on-balance-sheet development here. How your view is evolving, is there any change, are you more inclined to consider on-balance sheet here today and if not, what could get you to change your mind. Thank you. 
Dallas Tanner: Hey, hi Haendel. You know our philosophy stayed the same, just being so focused and being in the right locations. I think we've done a nice job of and the last couple of quarters is really starting to develop out some good channels in working with you know development partners and builders in market and I would expect that will continue to put resources and focus on finding ways to deliver new product into the portfolio.  In terms of taking on balance sheet risk, our position really hasn't changed there and we want to be as flexible as we can, quite frankly to be a good partner for the builders that are out there and less of a threat in terms of going out and competing against neighborhoods that they might also be pursuing.  So I think our approach in terms of building up really good pipelines with a couple of really, you know call it good partners, both at the national local and kind of boutique levels; having direct access to communities and product that they're building; and being discretionary in terms of where we think it's a good use of our own capital, because you pointed out you know and rightfully so, our balance sheet is getting into a really strong position and our ability you know to either raise equity or to issue at an appropriate price is a tool that we want to use when it makes sense.  And so I think we'll continue to be deliberate about when we do that, continue to focus on making sure we’re finding the right opportunities, but not necessarily having to take all that risk on balance sheets. We’ll stay open minded as we look at opportunities, but right now it feels like there's some really good runway in front of us, in perhaps partnering with a few builders and/or you know continually building out those channels for opportunity. 
Haendel St. Juste : Yes, so that's not exactly a no, but certainly not a – it’s not right now. 
Dallas Tanner: Yeah, it’s definitely not a yes. I mean right now we're really focused on taking the least amount of risk possible, but making sure that we can provide the company access to some of these great projects, and so that seems to be working. And I think you know builders are really good at what they do; we're really good at what we do, and if we can somehow match those two together over time and distance, we're going to be in a good position going forward. 
Haendel St. Juste : Got it, got it, thank you.
A - Dallas Tanner: Thanks Haendel.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Hightower from Evercore, go ahead.
Rich Hightower: Hey, good morning everybody, thanks for taking the question here. Just a quick one for me on the Opendoor investment. Obviously you're sitting on a nice gain, keeping it on the balance sheet for the time being, but just wondering what you know future plans are for that investment and are you restricted in the mean time you know with a lock up or anything that would prevent you from liquidating entirely. Just a little more color on that, thanks.
Ernie Freedman: Yeah, absolutely Rich. This is Ernie. Yeah, it's been a great partnership for us from a business perspective and we've been real pleased with the outcome on the investment and of course that mark was at December 31, so the investments up even further from where it was at December 31.  We are currently under a lock-up arrangement Rich, so we're not able to do anything and you can actually see the Opendoor public documents to be very specific about how that lock up works. We have the opportunity to sell some of the shares later in the second quarter and if the stock price stays at a certain level and it's been well above that level for a while, we’d have the flexibility to sell the entire position before the end of the second quarter.  We haven't made any determinations as to what we may want to do there. We do continue to work with Opendoor on a lot of different things. They are a great organization and so we'll just – we’ll come to a conclusion with our investment committee of our Board probably later in the quarter to decide what our longer term hold maybe for that position. 
Rich Hightower: Great, thanks for the color Ernie.
Ernie Freedman: You got it.
Operator: Tony yeah. Our next question is from Jade Rahmani from KBW, go ahead.
Jade Rahmani: Thank you very much. Some questions I’ve gotten from investors concerned the – relate to the competitive landscape and the increasing number of new entrants in this space. I think the front yard residential takeout is a recent example with the partnership that [inaudible] established with ARE.  So I just want to think about or get your thoughts as to whether you believe that newer entrants have a competitive edge advantage operationally over the established players such as Invitation Homes and American Homes for Rent or whether you think the reverse is the case, that the lessons learned that you've gone through having built the scale and investments in technology you've made will always provide yourselves and others like you with the upper hand over these newer entrants. 
A - Dallas Tanner: Yeah Jade, it’s the latter. I mean quite frankly, as your new coming into this business, there are so much you got to figure out, not only how do you run the assets, create the service model and build a team, but just the inner workings and how those all connect. It’s quite difficult and it’s taken companies like ours years to get better at and we're continually finding more efficiencies.  You know the flip side of that too Jade is when you get to our scale and are structured density and the communications and the tools and resources we have, we can onboard 1,200 homes in a quarter like we did in the fourth quarter and I don't mean make this you know sounds easy, but it's pretty easy for our company to digest that, and you know a new company would have all kinds of challenges in trying to just run the customer experience side of that. So the short answer is, it's much better to be in our position than coming into this space right now. 
Jade Rahmani: And as a follow-up have you seen any of these private entities have a either lower cost of capital or longer time horizon with respect to where they are underwriting cap rates You mentioned the homes were purchased with the med-5% stabilized cap rate. Are you seeing any of these bids come in materially below that 100 to 150 basis points below that, perhaps on a five to seven year view that if rent growth sustains itself, a private company would be able to absorb that drag, where as a public company so as to meet expectations with respect to the earnings outlook.
Dallas Tanner: It’s a good question. I mean there's definitely different niches within the space that I think different operators are trying to focus in on. And I would say, and as everybody in the call knows, we tend to buy a little bit higher price point asset, little higher gross economic rent. You know it’s a differentiator, so we don't typically see in the market place where we're really competing all that much with single family operators per se, maybe one or two.  I do think, your point around how people are using debt, thinking about leverage, especially at lower price points, they probably argued with themselves that they can lag into some better yields over time and maybe can't absorb some of that drag. I don't know, because we're not in their investment committees and thinking through kind of what their cost of capital is, but it varies.  I will say this, I do think that there are advantages to having a longer term lends and approach, because we certainly think about CapEx, what you want to do on your properties in the near term that can have a profound impact on how you operate those properties over the long term. And so you know I feel like we've kind of figured out internally what kind of the best finish standards are; you are seeing it in our return costs over time and distance; you're seeing it in our renewal rates; Charles and the team are doing a really good job around things like luxury vinyl plank flooring, which a new entrant may you know not be as keen as putting into a home, because it costs money and you've got to be able to have conviction that you can manufacture the returns over the life of that asset.  So things like that Jade come with experience, time the seat having managed thousands of properties and I think at Invitation Homes we’ve figured out kind of that right balance as we head into year nine as a business today. 
Jade Rahmani: Thank you very much. 
Dallas Tanner: Thanks Jade. 
Operator: Our next question is from Rick Skidmore from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. 
Rick Skidmore : Hey Dallas, good morning. Just a question, as you think about acquisitions and the geographic mix, how should we be thinking about that $1 billion being deployed in 2021 across your foot print? Is it going to be reasonably evenly distributed, focused more in the West, in Texas, can you just maybe give us some color on how you think about geographic mix going forward? Thanks. 
Dallas Tanner: Yeah good question. The mix I wouldn't expect too much change. I mean, if you just look at what we did in the fourth quarter, we are obviously very active in Dallas, active in a couple of the Florida markets. The JV actually I think is a good tool for us to give us more exposure in the Florida markets and the typical kind of Sun Belt focus for us has been a pretty consistent theme over the four to eight quarters. I would expect that to change all that much.  We would certainly love to be able to buy more homes in California and Washington. They are just very competitive markets from an end user perspective and we don't chase too hard when things get out of whack from a pricing perspective in terms of what works for us. We just kind of pick our moment. But I would expect that that focus remained the same. We've also seen really good activity out of Charlotte, Atlanta. They' are good markets and I think you know more importantly if you look at the rate growth that we're seeing in the fourth quarter in markets like Atlanta and even South Florida, it gives us a lot of conviction around where our risk adjusted return profile could look for the next several years. So all these markets have the right fundamentals around them as we’ve talked about on the call. 
Rick Skidmore : Right. Thanks and then one follow-up, in your prepared comments you talked about some of the ancillary revenue opportunities in 2021. Can you just elaborate on what you're planning to roll out in 2021 and how that might contribute to revenue growth in ’21? Thanks. 
Dallas Tanner: Yeah, there’s a couple of things. We’ve upgraded our smart home hardware; we’ve created some new structures that make that actually a little bit more profitable for us going forward. We updated in ’20 a HVAC filter program that was going out on all of our new leases that will then start to be brought in on some of our new opportunities with customers this year.  We have pilots going around pest control, in the state of Florida that has merely adoption as that seasons and we figure out the right way of delivering that service that could be something that will roll out across more markets. And then there are a couple of other things that we are going to pilot this year. We've got a big focus around pet compliance and controls that are focused for us that we think not only are revenue generators, but will also help us kind of mitigate some of those on going expenses.  So there's a couple things were focused in on. We've also got you know a few things in the test kitchen that we're not ready to talk about yet, but keeping things exciting and finding ways to deliver kind of some of that optionality to our resident is really a foremost focus.  We have figured out that our residents are adopting into a lot of the services. They like it, they like the flexibility of going in and out. So some of these will be optional, then some of them will obviously be included with the lease. 
Rick Skidmore : Great! Thanks Dallas. 
Dallas Tanner: Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question is from Todd Stender from Wells Fargo, go ahead. 
Todd Stender: Hi, thanks. Just one from me. In your prepared remarks you indicated that you might see a little more turnover this year. Is that you guys pushing rate a little more? You've got occupancy so high, but you also you got potentially residents on better financial footing. So maybe that naturally they have more housing options? Maybe just some color there? Thanks. 
Ernie Freedman: Yeah Todd, we had a great outcome with turnover in 2020 relative to 2019. It went from basically you know 30% down to 26% and we just, as we see the landscape this year, we think it's, you know it’s possible at the mid-point of our guidance that we see turn up and pick up somewhere kind of between those two numbers, just because it’s a naturalist evolution.  And the pandemic’s had some impacts in terms of what's happening with residents who are currently in place. Some likely chose to hunker down for a little bit longer, because of the uncertainty that we had in the spring and so yeah, we think we're going to see the continued downward trend in turn over all the leasing last seven or eight years age. It seemed to be accelerated a little bit in 2020. And so just for prudence purposes, we want to take the mid-point of our guidance, where we are going to assume that we kind of get somewhere that's a little bit North of where we were in 2020, but certainly a downward trend from what we saw in 2019. 
Todd Stender: Understood. Thank you. 
Operator: The next question is from Tyler Batory from Janney, go ahead. 
Tyler Batory: Hey, good morning, thanks for taking my question. Just one for me. I wanted to go back to the discussion on rent growth and bring in the relationship between higher home prices and rent growth. Just want to talk on the home sales side about affordability and obviously there is a different calculus there with lower interest rates. But can you talk more about how you're thinking about affordability on the new and the renewal side in terms of how much more you might be able to push price. And I understand the demand has been so strong, but at the same time, you know I imagine you want to price out potential renters as well, so just curious of your updated thoughts on both dynamics. 
Dallas Tanner: It’s a really good question Tyler, thanks and we think about our lease optimization curve and our revenue management system as you know really one of the darlings in our business. Because every year it gets a little bit smarter as we go through the portfolio of 80,000 homes. Every year the data gets better and we're certainly learning some things about how the portfolio behaves. Charles talked about this earlier in terms of what our expectations might be around the summer months.  Now, all things being constant in a normal year, we would expect certain things out of the portfolio. It's been a little bit different given – I would call it the nature of the decision making from a residence that they are wanting to stay put a little bit longer. It does bring in outside dynamics that have nothing to do with housing. So that's obviously added some increased demand and we’ve expect some of that to stay in place afro this year.  Now as you look at striking that balance around affordability, you got to take a step back. Interest rate volatility to your point can create some nuance around whether a home is more affordable to lease or to own in a particular market. Generally speaking, most of our portfolio is much cheaper to lease than it is to own when you look at down payment and the cost to maintain that home over its life cycle.  We offer a pretty friendly alternative to most folks as we manage all the maintenance expense and the potential CapEx risk that’s associated with that home. So you are taking a step back; it's much more affordable generally to leasing and you're right around that interest rate volatility maybe throwing those numbers out of whack.  We still see an opportunity to provide a pretty affordable product in most of our markets on a relative basis. Now that will vary with times and seasons, based on product price points and different submarkets, but you know all-in-all when you got a $1,900 rental in a market with great schools, good affordability, transportation corridors that lend themselves to close proximity to adjust, at the end of the day that’s a much more affordable product in more cases than not, than to be down payment heavy and to take on the burden of maintenance and maintenance expense.  So we're always trying to look at the portfolio and find ways, especially on the new lease side when a home goes vacant, to see, to make sure that we are capturing that market rate that is available out there and that on the renewals it’s been smart, finding the right balance, working with your normal supply and demand fundamentals and then lastly, also being considerate of what's going on in those markets.  So California a good example of that where we’re sensitive to the rank cash and everything that have been put in place and in Seattle where quite frankly we haven’t been able to really do anything around renewal rates for almost a year now. So that's the dynamic we're living in and I would say it's mostly healthy with some of that nuance that we’re having to navigate through with the portfolio today. 
Tyler Batory: Okay, I appreciate all that detail. Thanks very much. 
A - Dallas Tanner: Thanks. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks. 
Dallas Tanner: Thank you. We appreciate everyone joining us for the call and our thoughts and our sympathy with all those in Huston and Dallas, our residents and our associates there, during this weather. Hang in there, we’re all in this together. We appreciate everybody joining us today. Thanks.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Invitation Homes Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Greg Van Winkle, Vice President of Corporate Strategy, Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greg Van Winkle: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On today's call from Invitation Homes are Dallas Tanner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer. I'd like to point everyone to our third quarter 2020 earnings press release and supplemental information, which we may reference on today's call. This document can be found on the Investor Relations' section of our website at www.invh.com. I'd also like to inform you that certain statements made during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2020 and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. During this call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. We can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and supplemental information, which are available on the Investor Relations' section of our website. I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dallas Tanner.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you, Greg. We're thrilled to report yet another quarter of outstanding execution in a time when the need for high quality single family rental housing is greater than ever. I'm so proud of our team for consistently meeting that demand with unparalleled resident service, which is also translating to strong results for our shareholders. There are three points I want to emphasize in my remarks today. The first is that we continue to perform extremely well during COVID validating the strength and the stability of our business. The second is that we are more bullish than ever about the long term due to the fundamental tailwinds for our sector and Invitation Homes unique advantages.  The third is that because of our favorable position, we're staying on offense with respect to external growth, leveraging the power of our platform. We're having great success in finding acquisitions with compelling, expected returns that will also add to our economies of scale. We are opportunistically increasing our acquisition pace and we've diversified our capital sources with the joint venture to enhance and ensure our ability to remain opportunistic over a multi-year period. I'll now elaborate on our results that continue to strengthen through the pandemic Same-store occupancy set another record high of 97.8% in the third quarter, up 190 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points from last quarter. Rent growth has also accelerated, indicative of the fundamental strength in our markets. New lease rent growth of 5.5% in the quarter, was 130 basis points better than last year and up to 280 basis points from last quarter. On this higher base and potential rents, we continued to collect through September at a rate of 98% of our historical average collection rates. The unique differentiators of our business also continue to be a benefit to expenses. As a result, we were able to deliver 3.6%, same-store NOI growth in a period that continues to prove challenging for the broader economy and real estate sector. More importantly, we've continued to be a port in the storm for our residents, delivering exceptional service and genuine care that is resulting in an all time high residents, satisfaction scores. The self show technology and virtual experience that we've been utilizing for years is allowing perspective residents to feel safe throughout the leasing process. The freestanding nature of our assets is also allowing us to safely serve residents and maintain homes with some tweaks to our protocols for extra safety. With the safety measures in place, we have now completely worked through our backlog of work orders that have previously been deferred during the springtime. To say that our associates have been exceptional in their care for residents would be an understatement. I could not be prouder of our associates hard work and commitment under the circumstances. And we recently recognized their effort with a special bonus for all our frontline workers and non-executives in our corporate and field offices. We also continue to provide COVID specific benefits and flexibility to associates designed to promote their health, and also well being. We believe the past several quarters have battled tested and demonstrated the durability of our business. And looking ahead, we continue to see a bright future. The millennial generation is only beginning to reach our average resident age of 39 years. And surveying data indicates that COVID may be accelerating a shift in demand for denser urban housing to single family alternatives. With limited supply of single family homes available, we believe our sector is positioned to be a key part of housing solutions for years to come. Furthermore, we think the ease and flexibility of leasing from a professional property manager make the value proposition even more compelling for institutional single family rental operators, who today on less than 2% of the overall single family rental home market. With these tailwinds that are back, we ramped up acquisition activity in the third quarter and exceeded our expectations by deploying $175 million. The initial underwritten yield in these homes is consistent with where we were acquiring pre-COVID at 5.5% cap rates. After quarter end, we also closed the bulk acquisition in Dallas for $59 million at a 5.7% NOI cap rate on in-place rents, which we see upside to as we bring these homes onto our platform. But simply we feel very strongly that it continues to be a great time to invest in single family rental homes, especially with our ability to leverage our proprietary acquisition IQ technology, and local investment team's relationships and experience in buying across multiple channels. To diversify our capital sources in pursuit of this external growth opportunity, we have formed a joint venture with a like-minded partner that is expected to provide over $1 billion of additional dry powder for the next couple of years. This adds to the over $500 million of cash on our own balance sheet, in addition to strong operating cash flow, which we can use to grow our wholly owned portfolio. With these multiple capital sources available to fund our growth, we'll continue to have the opportunity to bring down our overall leverage. At the same time, we achieve our external growth goals. And thinking joint venture capital, our industry leading scale technology and experience as an operator positioned us well against the backdrop of substantial private investor demand, wanting to enter the single family rental space. We are thrilled to have partnered with a highly accomplished investor in a structure that makes great sense for our business. The structure allows for us to invest and manage properties for the JV identically to the way we invest in operate our wholly-owned portfolio. Acquisitions will be sourced by our investment team on an entity blind basis and allocated automatically between Invitation Homes and the JV in accordance with predetermined ratios that enable both entities to simultaneously achieve their capital deployment goals. In addition, our [indiscernible] structure makes the JV a potential pipeline for future on balance sheet, external growth when the JV reaches the end of its anticipated five to eight year life. Along the way, we learn asset management and property management fees expected to be well in excess of any incremental costs. In closing, we are excited about what the future holds for Invitation Homes. We believe the single family rental sector is favorably positioned within the housing market relative to other types of residential real estate. Within our uniquely positioned industry, we are differentiated from peers by three key advantages. The first is location of our homes, infill neighborhoods within high growth markets where the supply and demand are most in our favor. The second is our scale and market density with nearly 5,000 homes per market. The third is our local expertise and on the ground teams in our markets that enable us to better control the quality of our assets and the overall resident experience. We are committed to further enhancing that residents experience in the years ahead as we grow. And we thank you for your support as we pursue our mission. I'll now turn it over to Charles Young, our Chief Operating Officer.
Charles Young: Thank you, Dallas. Let me reiterate our appreciation for our teams who are out there everyday delivering genuine care to our residents. Their efforts have led to outstanding outcomes for both our residents and our shareholders for years. But the difference they make has shined even brighter during the pandemic. This quarter was no different. We're continuing to see the high quality homes and genuine care we deliver contribute to residents moving in sooner and staying longer. Specifically in the third quarter day three resident improved 14 days year-over-year to 26 days. And turnover fell 16% year-over-year from 8.7% to 7.3%. This drove 190 basis points year-over-year increase in occupancy to 97.8% with September marking the 11th straight month of sequential occupancy increases. At the same time, we are executing well to capture market rents. New lease rent growth, which we believe is most indicative of where fundamentals are today accelerated to 5.5% in the third quarter, up 130 basis points year-over-year. Furthermore, new lease rent growth increased each month during the quarter. Renewal rents increased 3.3% in the third quarter bringing same-store blended rent growth for the quarter to 4%. Same-store core revenues grew 2.4% year-over-year in the quarter 40 basis points higher than our second quarter performance. As a result of the aforementioned occupancy increase in a 3.2% increase in average rental rate, gross rental revenues increased 5.3% year-over-year. As expected, this increase was partially offset by two factors related to COVID-19. The first was an increase in bad debt from 0.4% of gross rental income in the third quarter of 2019 to 2.1% in the third quarter of 2020, which had 175 basis points impact on same-store core revenue growth in the quarter.  The second was a significant decrease in other property income, which had a 94 basis point impact on same-store core revenue growth in the quarter, primarily attributable to our non-enforcement of late fees. Same-store core expenses increased 0.4% year-over-year, net of resident recovery, same-store controllable expenses decreased 4.7% due primarily to lower resident turnover, fixed expenses in the quarter increased 3.9% primarily due to higher property taxes. This was halted in a 3.6% year-over-year increase in same-store NOI. Next I'll cover revenue collections, which remain very healthy, even as we continue to offer flexible payment options to our residents in need. And each month of the third quarter, our cash collections totaled 97% of monthly billings compared to a pre COVID average of 99%. We believe the strength of our revenue collections is a testament to the high quality and stability of our resident base. We put some context around that residents moving in over the last 12 months had an average income of nearly $110,000 across approximately two wage owners on average, covering rent by 4.8 times. As we move forward, similar to the last many months, we will remain nimble in leverage our local market presence to adapt quickly to change as we focus on providing high quality housing and service to our residents. That focus on flexibility and genuine care has served us well through the pandemic thus far. And I'm confident that it will continue to result in the best possible outcomes for our residents and shareholders. As we navigate the road ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today I will discuss the following topics, balance sheet and liquidity, investment activity in the third quarter, financial results for the third quarter and thoughts concerning the fourth quarter of 2020. With respect to liquidity, we had almost $1.6 billion of unrestricted cash and revolver capacity as a September 30th. We have no debt reaching final maturity before 2022 in over half of our assets are unencumbered.  Looking ahead, we remain committed to reducing leverage. The $560 million of cash on our balance sheet, along with expected operating cash flow and disposition proceeds, gives us significant runway to continue funding acquisitions without any additional debt. In the third quarter, we used cash from our June equity raise to acquire 544 homes for $175 million. We also sold 403 homes that did not fit with our long-term strategy for gross proceeds of $115 million. As things stand today with a compelling, external growth opportunity we are seeing in our markets, we plan to remain a net acquirer for the balance of 2020 and into 2021. Next I'll cover our financial results for the third quarter. Core FFO and AFFO per share for the third quarter increased 1.9% and 5.8% year-over-year to $0.30 and $0.24 respectively. These results were driven primarily by higher same-store NOI in lower recurring CapEx.  As a reminder, the impact of bad debt is included in both our core FFO and AFFO results. We reserve all receivables aged greater than 30 days as security deposits from residents upon moving typically cover receivables balances, age less than 30 days. Under our bad debt policy, charges are considered due based on the terms of the original lease with past due amounts in excess of security deposits, not recognized as revenue, even if they payment plan is in place with the resident. I'll now provide some thoughts on the fourth quarter of 2020. As Dallas mentioned, we feel great about the way our business is positioned for both the near and long-term future. That said pinpointing future results remains difficult due to uncertainty concerning the regulatory landscape and how the pandemic may continue to evolve. With two months left in 2020, though, I will provide some thoughts about how we are thinking about the conclusion of the year.  First, let me discuss items impacting revenue. With strong demand continuing we expect occupancy and leasing spreads in the fourth quarter to be as good or better than in the third quarter. Rent collections remaining source of uncertainty, but have been fairly steady in recent months at approximately 97% of billings. If collections were to continue at that same rate, we would expect bad debt to remain in the twos as a percentage of gross rental income.  Finally, we expect non-enforcement of late fees to continue to be a drag on revenue growth in the fourth quarter. In each of the second and third quarters, late fee income fell by approximately $3 million year-over-year. As we continue to provide flexibility to residents, we would expect late fees to decline similarly year-over-year in the fourth quarter, With respect to expenses, cost to maintain typically decreases seasonally from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. We'd expect a sequential decline in cost to maintain in the fourth quarter 2020 as well that we may not see as large of a seasonal decrease as in typical years, because turnover was already so low in the third quarter of 2020. That said, turnover should be beneficial from a year-over-year perspective. Taking a step back, 2020 is shaping up to be a year to be proud of with respect to both our positive impact on residents and the financial results we are producing and mid challenging circumstances in the world around us. Resident satisfaction scores are at an all time high and we've generated year-to-date AFFO growth of 6.8% through the third quarter in sharp contrast to many others in the real estate sector.  We believe this is a result, not only of our unique fundamentals of the single family rental industry, but also of our differentiated locations, scale and local expertise. With those advantages on our side, we are focused on remaining nimble to continue delivering great outcomes for our residents, communities, and shareholders in our path forward. With that, let's open up the line for Q&A.
Operator: We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Dallas, clearly the transaction market is attracting a lot of capital. So if you think about the amount of capital that's chasing deals, both from an institutional perspective, but also from end users, how do you think that ultimately impacts going in cap rates? And would you expect to see some compression there going forward?
Dallas Tanner: We've asked ourselves the same question, Nick, in terms of how to think about expectations through the end of the year and also early next. Well, we've kind of found this kind of been the case for the last couple of years, because we've been able to in that sweet spot, called mid fives from a going in stabilized NOI cap rate, that's been pretty achievable now. You've certainly seen some ebb and flow and this year has been a little bit different than normal given that the transaction volume from the end user is going much further into the year than normal. But we keep thinking, we might need to underwrite maybe a little bit have some expectations around cap rates can present, but they haven't. And in large part it's because rate on the leasing side is following a pair of pursue with the home price appreciation that we're seeing in the marketplaces. So overall it still feels really healthy. We'll see somewhere around 6 million transactions in the U.S. this year, which is in line with what expectations were going into the beginning of the year. And certainly the month of supply is something we're going to keep our eye on because it is pretty low right now, given where we are at this point in the year.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then maybe just the flip side of that disposition, you've continued to sell assets. Obviously, it sounds like external growth is a focus, but how should we think about disposition activity over the next few quarters?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. We would expect to still be calling, pieces and parts of the portfolio that don't line up and we'll do that. That's ordinary course for us. We've been doing that for years. We have said in signal in the past that we think dispositions ultimately will be a little bit lower than where we've been traditionally and I'd expect that to be the case. The good news is that when we do go out and try to sell, given the low supply, we're getting excellent pricing and whether that's selling something vacant or small portfolios that we might sell to a smaller operator, pricing there's been excellent and multiple offers and all that everything you want to see from a selling perspective.
Nick Joseph: The trailing call it $125 million a quarter, a good run rate, at least in the near term.
Ernie Freedman: Nick, this is Ernie. I think over the next period of time, you see it's kind of Atlanta [ph] in the $50 million to $100 million dollar range each quarter going forward, which would be about one to one and a half, maybe 2% of our portfolio that feels like for the foreseeable future where it will be.
Nick Joseph: Great. Thank you very much.
Ernie Freedman: Thank, Nick.
Operator: The next question comes from Alua Askarbek with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Alua Askarbek: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. So just to start off looking at the renewal rates, it looks like they dropped 20 basis points from 2Q. Is it because renters are negotiating their leases more? Or is this just leases that became effective after being signed earlier in the pandemic?
Charles Young: Yes. Thanks for the question. This is Charles. When you think about renewal growth, a lot of it is the fact that we price renewals about 90 days before expiration. And so you're going out when the pandemic hit at March. You're going out at rates that we were being very cautious as the pandemic unfolded and we gave our teams a little bit more room to negotiate. And so as you look at how it's transpired, we hit our low point on the renewal side in June and July. When you think about where we were 90 days prior to that, but what's been great is we've gone out at a little higher rates and we've had our teams negotiate since then a little tighter on the – as to the actual and you seen each month since then, we're accelerating on a renewal growth and those trends continue today. So I think some of it is just us being thoughtful, trying to solve for occupancy position of power. And then on the flip side when we do flip, because we're in a strong occupancy position, the new lease growth has been really strong. So we think renewals will continue to get better as things stabilize.
Alua Askarbek: Got it. And where are renewals going out right now for November and December? You guys can share that. 
Charles Young: Yes, no problem. So November, December, we're going out in a kind of low five to mid fives. And then we're just starting to look at January we're actually going out mid to high five. So like I said, we're going out a bit more aggressive to capture market rents. And then we're asking our teams to continue to work with folks, but also kind of tighten that negotiation band up. We've had a little bit more spread than normal because of the pandemic.
Alua Askarbek: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Douglas Harter from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harter: Thanks. I guess as you layer in the JV, capital to be deployed, how should we think about the pace of acquisitions in the coming quarters?
Ernie Freedman: Hey, Doug, this is Ernie. I think we see a real opportunity, especially coming off of how we did in the third quarter, and I'll turn it over to Dallas for a second here. Just to give you a little sense for how October shaped out. We talked about in the earnings release a bulk acquisition, but that was just a portion of what we did in October. Yes, I think our goal is we go into next year is roughly a 50:50 split between balance sheet activity and JV activity. And we're seeing the opportunity to potentially, ramp up our overall acquisition pace. And again, roughly half ago in the JV, half ago in the balance sheet. But, Dallas, why should give a quick highlight on October, so folks can get a sense for, it may be a one-off month, but it's been a very strong one for us October.
Dallas Tanner: Yes. And just for clarity, remember we took off about three months of buying activity in the pandemic. So when we turn things back on towards the middle end of June, you obviously have a little bit of a lag between when you start to close properties. We've historically said, we feel pretty comfortable between that $200 million and $250 million a quarter, but Ernie’s point in October, we're likely to close about $150 million worth of new property. So our fourth quarter could be a little bit bigger. And then I would say that as we monitor the path of progress going forward, what supply looks and feels like, there's certainly an ability to outperform that $250 million a quarter, if we see the opportunity in front of us.
Ernie Freedman: Yes. So 59 of that 150 was the bulk transaction we talked about in the earnings release, but we've seen the one-off acquisition pace, keep the ramping up each month during the last few months. So we're feeling really good as we go into next year.
Douglas Harter: And then just – I guess does the October volume kind of gets split between the JV and the balance sheet, or I guess when do we start to see that split?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. We haven't closed into the JV yet. We're finalizing our financing for the JV. I would do expect before the year is done that you will see some assets close into the JV probably later in November, certainly in December. But as of right now, everything is still closing on the balance sheet.
Douglas Harter: Great. Thank you.
Ernie Freedman: Thanks Doug.
Operator: Next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Dennis McGill: Good morning. Thank you guys. First question just has to do with more on the expense side. This is maybe more just a general directional question, but do you have any sense of how many of your tenants are in work from home mode now, and then more bigger picture as you roll forward? What they 12 or 18 months, give any thought to what an elevated level of work from home would mean for maintenance and service expenses either good or bad?
Charles Young: Hey, Dennis. This is Charles here. We don't have any specific data that says how many are working for home, but anecdotally many of us are. And I think it's clear that there's more use on our homes and then we'd had in the past. But there's also the benefit of lower turnover because people want to stay in their homes. They're appreciating that we have that extra space and extra bedroom and people can functionally work from home and take care of the kids and all that. So we're going to continue to monitor it. I think at the end of the day, there may be a little bit more wear and tear, but it's going to be hard to quantify, but we're also seeing lower turnover. That's helping us. So I think it's going to balance itself out. We’ll see where it goes overtime. But we’re going to continue to monitor that. We’re now going into homes. We’re doing all of work orders as Dallas said in our prepared remarks. And we're completely caught up on any deferred work orders. So we're going to keep running our ProCare program and make sure that we're servicing our homes when residents need it. So time will tell, but as you can expect, I would think most people are working from home, like the rest of the economy. That will get less and less over time as the economy starts to open back up.
Dennis McGill: Got it. And then on the property tax side, I think, it's been relatively stable in this 5%, 6% range. We're seeing really aggressive price appreciation in the marketplace now, especially on a seasonally adjusted basis. And I imagine that's going to take some time to come through. But what would you consider to be the typical lag of with the price appreciation today and when you might have to see that come through on the property tax side? And any preliminary conversations or expectations you'd have about how that might filter through would be helpful.
Ernie Freedman: Yes, Dennis. This is Ernie. And unfortunately the downside of home price appreciation, which is such a positive for us is it is likely we’ll continue to see assessments that are greater than inflation and having greater than inflationary pressure on our real estate taxes. It typically takes about 12 to 18 months for it to cycle through. We're in pretty constant communication across the country. It's different times and different cycles, but we're in pretty constant communication across the country with folks with regards to what's happening in localities, we’re working with our experts, as well as working with – and the local assessors to see what we can do. And so that should be a constant part of our business. It's our biggest expense. And we have a good team in place, good support around the country. But my guess is what you're seeing now you'll see flow through probably not in 2021 tax bills, but if not 2021, 2022.
Dennis McGill: Ernie, would you expect that there's going to be added pressure from just municipal budget shortfalls on rate on top of just the value pressure?
Ernie Freedman: Well, Dennis, there could be, but at the same time, remember that they have to pass along those same assessments and increases to all the people who vote in those local jurisdictions because we get taxed the same way as end-users. And so I think in general, there's going to be pressures in some jurisdictions. And the good news is the jurisdictions, where is the biggest pressures and where's the – the biggest fiscal challenges are probably in markets where we're not invested, lot of the markets in the Northeast, very few in – a few of the dollars invested in the Midwest in some of those markets. So I think other parts of the country we'll see even more pressure there, but my guess is broader commercial real estate owners will have more pressure than residential owners for the fact that if we get a higher tax bill, so does everyone else in the neighborhood who votes and lives in that jurisdiction.
Dennis McGill: Okay that’s helpful. Thank you guys. Good luck.
Ernie Freedman: Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks.
Operator: Next question comes from Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Hey, Ernie, how are you this morning?
Ernie Freedman: Good morning Rich I'm doing well. How about yourself?
Rich Hill: I'm lovely. 
Ernie Freedman: Great.
Rich Hill: Hey I want to come back to the breadcrumbs that you were kind enough to give us both for 4Q and 2021. I want to, first of all, start with the headwinds on bad debt. At some point you're going to anniversary and at some point you are going to be collecting more rent in line with what you've historically collected. Because as we think about 2021 is there a scenario where those headwinds actually become tailwinds in the second half of the year?
Ernie Freedman: I think certainly as things normalize and it's hard to predict when that's going to normalize, we hope it's in 2021, that we'll get back to I would hope bad debts, the numbers that we used to have in the past, which were 40 to 50 basis points. So I think that's certainly a possibility. It's very hard to predict right now when that may happen. But that would certainly be an expectation at some point as we work our way through this cycle.
Rich Hill: Got it. And then the second portion of that is the leasing growth that you're seeing. I think you said 5% for renewals, everything that we're seeing on the new lease side suggest that, it can continue to accelerate higher from what you reported in 3Q. So as I'm thinking about 2020, 2021, it just seems to me that the bad debt headwind goes away, the lease growth continues to rise and so there's a real healthy path for maybe meaningful increase – acceleration in same-store rev. And I'm not asking you to guide, but I'm just trying to make our methodology is correct as we think about that.
Ernie Freedman: Well, certainly as we're finishing out this fourth quarter here, where we're seeing acceleration in a lot of important factors in a favorable way on the same-store side. In October we're anticipating our original growth rates will be higher than it was in September, we're expecting the new lease rate to be higher than it was in September. And occupancy is actually going to tick up probably about five or 10 basis points as we finish out the month. So we're – and we finished at 97.9 for September, it looks like October is going to get to 98.0. As they always say, trees don't grow to the sky Rich, but things are certainly set up favorably for us from a supply and demand perspective. And we're seeing this in a time where typically you wouldn't see any of it. We’re at a peak season right now. So, I've been in the residential space for a long time and have not seen accelerating fundamentals this late after peak season. So that all sets up very favorably for us. On the flip side we're in a challenging environment. And it's not known exactly how that pandemic is going – how it's going to play out, whether local regulatory rules change on us and in terms of how we can run our business and things like that. But we're certainly feeling very good about how we did through the third quarter in fortunate where we're at team has worked really hard. It's setting us up for a good fourth quarter, as we gave the breadcrumbs, it feels a lot like how the third quarter will be, or maybe a little bit better on the same-store metrics, as I talked about in the prepared remarks. I want to be cautious about getting too far ahead of ourselves about what 90, 180, 360 days out may look like.
Rich Hill: Understood. You and I have different jobs. But I appreciate that. Thanks guys. Nice quarter.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you, Rich.
Operator: The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey there. Good morning.
Dallas Tanner: Good morning Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey guys. So I guess my first question is on the pricing power in the portfolio, the continued acceleration in pricing power this year has been pretty remarkable, you're pushing rents at levels you were a year ago and deeper into the years than you typically would while still managing to grow occupancy 11 months in a row. And it sounds like by your comments that you're still, if you are willing to push maybe even a little harder on the rate side here going into the year end. So I guess I'm curious, it sounds like the demand is strong, so perhaps some color on maybe some application levels and how they compare it to maybe a year ago? But also how were we thinking about occupancy? Are you willing to perhaps create a bit of occupancy here to sustain that 4%-ish type of blended rate growth? And then as we look into next year, the world returning a bit to maybe a more normal place, or at least on a path to more normal post vaccine, how concerned are you about maybe some of that occupancy, degradation or other operating headwinds? Thanks.
Ernie Freedman: No, you always seem to do a good job asking multiple questions in one. So we will make sure we try to get it done. So let me it over to Charles to see if we can get through each of those items you brought up.
Charles Young: Great. Hey, Haendel I'll do my best to kind of work through it. Why don't I start with occupancy because, I think, it's an important note to highlight? I think I said this on the last call when COVID hit, we were actually running really nicely on occupancy. We're at kind of an all-time high for that period in Q1, Q2 at the time. And so we came in under a position of strength and then we wanted to see how it all played out. And so we got a little conservative on rate and saw for that occupancy, but we quickly pivoted and you can see now how we're pushing. But some of that occupancy gain is yes, lower turnover, yes, it's COVID demand, but it's also been really great execution by our teams on days to be resident. We're, as I mentioned, we're down 14 days in Q3 and we're down seven days overall. And that has a real push on how quickly we turn and keeping our occupancy up. So if we can continue to do that, that gives us some confidence to try to get back to some normalcy on the rate side and try to capture market rents. And so you're seeing that absolutely on the new lease side. And we ended September on new lease at a 6.2% and October, seems to have the same similar demand. Again, this is very late in the season. Typically, seasonality will slow down right now. So we're trying to capture that. And as I talked about in my earlier call earlier comments, we're trying to balance the renewal side. We're getting back to normal to a degree, but we are still instructing our teams to find that right balance. And so we're not going to push too hard into the winter here when we don't have a vaccine and we know that there may be some moments where there's going to be some uncertainty. So we're just trying to find that right balance. And keeping that occupancy high gives us a position where we feel like we can do that. And keeping days to be resident where we want to is another place to do that. And a lot of that has been driven by just getting our turn times down, pre-leasing and being really thoughtful around how we manage that side of the business.
Haendel St. Juste: Charles thank you. I guess I wanted to ask a question on the JV as well. Regarding more potential conflicts that might arise, I understand that JV is going to pursue similar assets that you will on your own balance sheet. So maybe, can you talk about the mechanism for resolving any perceived conflicts on what new buy versus what’s perhaps the JV would buy in similar markets? And then also understand that you said your new JV partner has also formed a new JV with one of your peers. So curious how that potential perception of conflict might be carved out or addressed? Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: Yes, great question Haendel. First of all, I'll talk more about the overall structure, but there's no conflict between us and anything that would do with that other peer. We have a defined price zones that we're allowed to invest and operate in and the same for them. And so, as you know, we typically buy a little more, higher end nicer product. I think the way to think about the JV is that it's incremental growth for our business at the end of the day. And I'll give you an example. In a market like Atlanta, where we have 12,500 units, we are on balance sheet, obviously a bit more, picky about what would go into the portfolio at any given time, given that we have substantial scale and exposure in that market. We certainly see opportunities to invest in Atlanta and the JV is a perfect vehicle for us to go in and to maybe be more active than we otherwise would on our wholly owned balance sheet, given our own capital limitations or expectations.  The way that we've done it internally is that with our buying, we have basically an agnostic way for our teams to be as active as they normally are. And then we're able to allocate the properties between the balance sheet and the JV after they go into contract. And so at the ground level or at the call it market level, our folks aren't making those decisions as to where they go. We have predetermined ratios as Ernie mentioned that help us kind of delineate when and where those will go based on market parameters that we've discussed with our partners in the JV.
Haendel St. Juste: Yes, that’s great Dallas. And if I may add a follow-up to that, what about future overall JV appetite? I can guess is this it for now? Certainly we've heard stories of the long list of folks interested in investing in the space. So just curious if the future of JV appetite, if perhaps you'd be willing to bring in a second partner, or perhaps, are you more inclined to expand this current JV out or, do you have the ability to extend this one further up? Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: We're comfortable with the partner we have right now. I think 2020 is the perfect example of why having a flexible structure with a partner like Rockpoint is perfect for us in this environment. There's stock price volatility. You still see meaningful opportunities to invest and grow your own balance sheet. We have absolute flexibility as a company to take down any potential M&A on our balance sheet. We haven't given away any of those rights or anything like that. And in addition, as we see opportunities to grow, if this particular structure worked, I'm sure we could find ways to expand it if we want it to, but we're comfortable with what we've got. And we don't want to take a focus off growing our own balance sheet as well. That is a big focus for us and we have not negated any of that flexibility going forward.
Haendel St. Juste: Great. Thanks Dallas.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you.
Ernie Freedman: Thanks Haendel.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi everyone. This is Ryan [ph] on Jade. Thanks for taking the questions. Just looking at the bill to rent model that a number of other players are looking to pursue or are pursuing, has your view around that strategy changed at all? Wondering if he would consider increasing your footprint there whether through on balance sheet or potentially through JVs in that strategy?
Dallas Tanner: So about 10% of what we buy today comes from builders more or less in parts of communities where we'll buy new product that's got builder warranties and everything else associated with, that you like about that model. But again, not compromising location. I think for us as we've done some of this and dove into it, first thing is we don't like the balance sheet risk that's associated with being a developer in today's environment. You've got rising prices, rising costs, labor challenges.  We love the idea of being able to buy direct and being able to be one of the best buyers of finished homes from builders. We think that's a good opportunity for us if it lines up with our expectations around location. We are certainly open to thinking strategically with partners in the market, whether it be builders that are local or boutique in nature in finding ways to create more opportunities together. I think we are very comfortable right now in the fact that we're not out buying land, working on entitlements and running that part of the business. We feel very comfortable with our playbook that we're operating in right now.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. You mentioned you see upside in the Dallas portfolio, you acquired in terms of yield. I was wondering if you can quantify that at all and maybe more broadly discuss the type of return of public you can typically achieve by bringing on these smaller portfolios onto your more scaled platform?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, that's a great question. I can also talk about the trade that we did in the first quarter in Las Vegas last year. It's interesting when we buy these portfolios where the asset quality lines up with what we want in our portfolio long-term, almost nine times out of 10, we see some embedded loss to lease in a lot of these properties. And so for us, we're able to be either a bit more aggressive on the underwrite or feel pretty comfortable given where the current yields are that we can argue a discount on pricing and be able to go in and over the course of 12 months, pick up a lot of that embedded loss of lease. So in the case of the portfolio in Dallas, there's probably an easy 30 basis points of yield there if we just go in and restructure leases, whether on the renewal or as things go vacant and roll off. And we saw that in the portfolio that we did in Las Vegas last year, where, I think, we bought it in the kind of mid-to-high fives and very quickly we were in like the low sixes once we had turned all those turned all those units within a 12-month period, or re-established renewal pricing. Very quickly, we got to kind of a stabilize NOA yield in the low sixes. So that's hard to buy in a market like Las Vegas or Dallas today given the quality that we go after. So we definitely like the opportunities to buy these smaller portfolios that have been assembled and are somewhat stabilized.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Rick Skidmore: Thank you. Dallas, just a couple of quick ones, in terms of ramping up acquisitions, do you have to scale up personnel to do that, or can you do that in your existing headcount?
Dallas Tanner: We're built for a variety of scale with the team that we have, so no impact on head count.
Rick Skidmore: All right. And then second quick one. In terms of ancillary revenue, you talked about a year ago at your Investor Day ancillary revenue growth. How are you thinking about that now and as you go into 2021? Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: Yes, we're well in line with our plan that we laid out the Investor Day. We've updated both the programming and our smart rent packages, as well as some of the optional opportunities for our residents. And there's a few more pilots we'll be rolling out this year that will help expand that offering. It was also driven down on our monthly costs, which will create a better spread for the business overall over the long haul. The second thing is we've also rolled out our updated filter programs, which are now automatic as part of our leases. If you sign a new lease with us today, we will – you get filters drop shipped to your home every 90 days that are expected to be replaced by the resident. There's a cost benefit to that for the business as well. But also on the expense side, we believe that this will have a material impact over time in helping drive down HVAC cost. And then there are a few other things that we're piloting this year that we talked about during the Investor Day, such as pest control, a few other kind of ideas that we're piling out and fine tuning before we roll out nationally. But we're well on our way to achieving some of those goals that we laid out in September of last year.
Rick Skidmore: Okay. Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Tyler Batory from Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Tyler Batory: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Wanted to follow-up on the acquisition topic. I'm sorry to beat a dead horse in terms of some of these questions. But any markets specifically that are looking more or less attractive in terms of some of the demand dynamics out there as you are ramping up acquisitions, any thoughts in terms of moving into new markets, perhaps? And then last, when you are looking at the mix of where you might be sourcing acquisitions, any change there, I should see more opportunities on the bolt side or on crafts working with builders as well?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, no real change in the volume mix. I would say 70%, 80% of this is typically coming through traditional channels right now, maybe another 10% to 15% through builder relationships. And then I put 5% in kind of the iBuyers/FSBO community piece of it. I think our channels are getting better and more robust with iBuyers, we're working on algorithms and things with them that will also open up hopefully new product lines. We talked about sale lease back in the past, and that's an area that we're really focused on. In terms of market mix, no, it's the usual suspects for us. I mean, we love the Sun Belt. We love the fact that our coastal presence is still have a tremendous amount of demand. I mean, if you look at the difference between what multi-family are seeing in California, versus what we're seeing in single family, it's almost night and day. And we're seeing really good blended rates come out of both Southern and Northern California with extremely high occupancy. So those continue to be good markets for us. We want to try to buy as much product as we can in markets like Phoenix, Denver, and Dallas and continue to add to our footprints as I mentioned before on the question around the JV in markets like Charlotte and Atlanta. And we've continued to call in relation to your disposition question on the margins parts of the Midwest, a little bit of South Florida being smart about HOAs that are presenting challenges or properties that have potential cap for us down the road. So teams have done – the asset management group specifically has done a really nice job of putting the portfolio in the shape it is in today, so that Charles and his teams can go out and execute the numbers they are.
Tyler Batory: Okay, great. That's helpful. And as a follow-up question, curious on the CapEx side of things, both reoccurring, and on the initial renovation, CapEx you see many cost creep in terms of labor or material costs that might be impactful there.
Ernie Freedman: Hey, Tyler, we haven't. So unfortunately – our initial renovation budgets have been running on budget or slightly inside, and we continue to harden our assets at the beginning, and investing more when we acquire a home than they would have maybe seven, or eight, or nine years ago. So that hasn't been a price pressure for us. And on the R&M recurring CapEx side, fortunately we're locked into some good contracts for the majority of the things that we're buying for R&M. So we haven't seen any challenges really on the labor side or the cost side, but we're monitoring it very, very closely. It's the great question to ask in this environment that there could be some pressure there, but so far we're doing okay.
Tyler Batory: Great. That's all for me. Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Just one question from me. Dallas, a follow-up on the disposition conversation, curious in some markets that you don't think are a long-term hold, are you less bullish on, is COVID kind of handing you a gift in terms of a temporary sugar high and values are propping up values where we stare at three to five years, and the values don't make sense in terms of the rent growth you can expect. And you potentially pull forward a market exit or a big bulk sale.
Dallas Tanner: Yes, I think sugar rush is probably too strong of a word. I mean, truthfully John is, I think, about it if you take a step back, we're probably under supplied by plus or minus a million housing units today. So that's creating natural pressure on pricing, right, from a demand perspective. I think in some of these markets where we have seen, to your point, probably better pricing later in the year totally has to do with some of the COVID-related impact.  In Florida, for example, I'm sure you're seeing some of the same things. I mean, house prices are moving very quickly and people from the northeast moving south, they want the warm weather, they want space. A lot of bankers taking temporary residents in parts of like Florida. I know several of them. And they are buying homes and making decisions on school districts and all these things, whether it's for a one to two-year’s time or if it's going to be a longer term. I think some of that has definitely carried through on pricing powers, we’re going to sell assets.  But taking a step back to last year, this time we weren't having any problems selling assets at the same point in time in 2019. There's plenty of demand given that supply has been pretty low year-over-year. But I mean, a little bit of a sugar rush, maybe does that equate to maybe an opportunity to your latter part of your question in selling parts of markets down the road? Well first of all, I don't see – I don't see anything in our portfolio today that would suggest that we want to get out of the market completely. So I don't think it's really relevant to the way we're looking at our book today. And remember these things, if you try to sell an entire market we’ll trade on some sort of a yield. So you got to be in line with where, normalized price parameters would be for somebody that's looking at something of a trade of that size. So I don't think so is the short answer to your question, but it certainly feels healthy. It feels like the lack of supply in the marketplace is being a bit exacerbated with people moving south. And you are seeing that reflect in both rate and asset pricing for sure.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Got it. Thank you. 
Dallas Tanner: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Hi everyone. How are you doing? You have covered a lot, so try to be creative. I'm trying to better understand the NAB accretion opportunity here. And given the continued and recent rise in single family home values and even largely, or especially in your markets, how do you track and what is the embedded mark-to-market of the portfolio versus when the homes were fired? And secondly, more specific to the dispose in 3Q, can you share the gain on sales versus the initial home purchase price plus CapEx?
Dallas Tanner: So Derrick we look at any of the – we look at it a couple of different ways. We do it in one way that you just kind of described was we take it on a home-by-home basis. We look at the last time we got a BPO, a broker price opinion. And then we rolled that forward based on our housing index. And we do that again on a home-by-home basis. So it's a pretty large spreadsheet, to give us a sense for what they think the homes are worth from a BPO perspective. But what we also do is we triangulate it against the cap rate approach. We got pretty good sense of where cap rates are in each of our markets because we're active buyers and we're active sellers. And we compare those two amounts often average them, because they're not always on top of each other to get a sense for what I think our NAV is. We certainly have had seen some great appreciation from when we bought these homes. And if you think about it, and then we bought 50,000 of these homes and the Invitation Homes around the world, mainly in 2012, 2013, 2014, and then we – another 30,000 homes came on the platform at fair value when we did a merger with Colony Starwood, and of course those homes are about the same time between 2012, 2013, 2014. There was some nice increases at that point. So I don't have an exact number I can share with you that, what is the appreciation from our cost basis of our homes other than if you look at our GAAP financial statements and see what are our cost basis is there, I think, most would agree if you do a cap rate approach or BPO approach, there's a significant increase in what those values are today and where that would be in certainly in the many billions of dollars and in terms of the increase that's happened there. And then in terms of we do disclose in our GAAP financial statements, the gains that we have as we sell homes off the top of my head, Derek, I can't give you the exact number. I'm sorry. As what that is, other than we disclosed on our financial statements.
Derek Johnston: We can look that up. Thanks guys.
Operator: There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks, please.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks again for joining us today. We wish you all the best. Please stay safe. And operator this concludes our call.
Operator: Okay. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Invitation Homes Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in listen-only mode at this time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Greg Van Winkle, Vice President of Corporate Strategy, Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greg Van Winkle: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On today's call from Invitation Homes are Dallas Tanner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer. I'd like to point everyone to our second quarter 2020 earnings press release and supplemental information, which we may reference on today's call. This document can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. I'd also like to inform you that certain statements made during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2020 and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. During this call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, in our earnings release and supplemental information, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dallas Tanner.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you, Greg. I hope everyone today is doing well and staying safe, which continues to be our top priority at Invitation Homes. Residents are choosing the Invitation Homes leasing lifestyle now more than ever, and we believe we are safely delivering what customers are asking for with exceptional execution. I'm proud of what we've led with genuine care through the pandemic and is showing up favorably in both our resident satisfaction scores and our financial results. AFFO per share increased over 9% year-over-year in the second quarter. Blended rent growth accelerated sequentially each month of quarter. Turnover rate and days to reresident continue to be materially lower than prior year, contributing to our record high occupancy of 97.5% while at the same time helping to drive controllable costs and recurring CapEx lower year-over-year. Rent collections also improved over the course of the quarter with June and July collections near historical averages. These positive trends in our business, supported by the essential nature of our product, the location of our homes and the stability of our resident base also gave us the validation we were looking for to resume acquisitions in June. I'm very proud that our team has been able to accomplish all of these things over the last several months while prioritizing the safety of our residents, associates and communities above all else and while being there to help some residents through difficult financial circumstances with payment programs. Let me expand on what we're doing from a safety perspective for the wellbeing of all of our stakeholders. First, we continue to leverage self-show technology for leasing tours. And as a reminder, this technology is not something new we have to implement. We have been successfully offering self-showing as an option for years. Today, our self-show capability is not only helping to keep agents and prospective residents safe, it’s also serving as a competitive advantage in the leasing market. With respect to occupied homes, you have implemented optionality to perform resident move-in orientations and pre-move-out visits virtually while we remain paused on ProCare proactive homebuilding. We continue to address emergency work orders as we have since the beginning of the pandemic. And in June, we resumed providing non-emergency service to residents as appropriate on a case by case basis. In providing service to residents, our teams and partners follow a strict set of safety protocols on which associates have been trained. Our procurement team has also worked hard to secure PPE, and we are maintaining a three month supply of masks, gloves and hand sanitizers. Finally, we continue to focus on ensuring that associates, who are able to work from home are well equipped to do so. And we continue to provide additional COVID specific benefits to associates designed to promote their health and wellbeing. In being thoughtful about these measures, we've been able to run our business nearly as efficiently in the current environment as we did with our offices fully opened. As we move forward from here, we will continue to stay nimble in the present to safely provide high quality homes and genuine care to our residents while at the same time pursuing growth toward a bright future. We remain bullish about the long-term. We see a significant pipeline of demand moving towards single family rental over the next decade with over 65 million Americans aged 20 to 34 years old and we believe single family housing supply is unlikely to be sufficient to meet the demand that these demographics create in our markets.  The ripple effects of COVID-19 seem to be intensifying shift in preferences towards single-family space over denser housing options today. In fact we've begun surveying residents upon move-in to learn more about how the pandemic may be influencing their housing decisions. Approximately 30% of the over 500 survey respondents, who moved into our homes in April and May, moved from denser urban areas to our homes. And approximately 30% said, COVID-19 increased their desire to live in a single family home versus an apartment or a townhome. On top of organic growth and accretive acquisition, we are also pursuing initiatives like value enhancing CapEx investments and ancillary service expansion to further enhance our resident experience, portfolio and returns. As we pursue this long-term growth opportunity and as we navigate the near-term COVID environment, there are three key differentiators that we think contribute to our advantage. The first is the location of our homes in the areas we are currently investing, infill neighborhoods and high growth markets, where supply and demand fundamentals are most in our favor. The second is our scale and market density with almost 5,000 homes per market. That scale is nearly impossible to replicate and is a key driver of our efficiency in the real-time market intel we derive from our portfolio. Third is our focus on being local and leveraging on-the-ground teams in our markets in collaboration with centralized support. This enhances our control over asset quality and the resident experience. And is only possible with the scale and the people we have in place. Thank you all for supporting us as we continue to put these competitive advantages to work for the benefit of our residents, associates, communities and investors. Our mission statement is together with you, we make a house a home. Demand for our product is as strong as it has ever been and we will continue to meet that demand by leading on our core values of genuine care and standout citizenship to make a house a home, regardless of what may come our way. With that, I'll turn it over to Charles Young, our Chief Operating Officer.
Charles Young: Thank you, Dallas. First, I want to say thank you to our field and the team. I knew we had a great team before the pandemic, but what I've witnessed over the last several months has proven just how remarkable our associates really are. They've seen a lot of change coming their way, but I've never wavered in their commitment to genuine resident care. That commitment was evident in our second quarter operating results, which I'll cover now. Same-store average occupancy in the second quarter was 97.5%, up 80 basis points sequentially and up 100 basis points year-over-year. Average rental rate increased 3.7% year-over-year in the second quarter. As a result, gross rental revenues increased 4.7% year-over-year, partially offsetting this were two factors related to COVID-19. The first was an increase in bad debt from 0.4% of gross rental income in the second quarter of 2019 to 1.9% in the second quarter of 2020, which was 150 basis point impact on same-store core revenue growth in the quarter. The second was a significant decrease in our other property income, which was 107 basis point impact on same-store core revenue growth in the quarter, primarily attributable to our non-enforcement of late fees. As a result, overall, same-store core revenues grew 2% year-over-year in the quarter. Same-store core expenses increased 1.3% year-over-year, net of resident recovery same-store controllable expenses decreased 4.2%. The majority of the year-over-year decrease in controllable expenses with due to improvements in turnover costs largely attributable to lower resident turnover rates. Fixed expenses in the second quarter increased 4.8%, primarily due to higher property taxes. This resulted in a 2.3% year-over-year increase in same-store NOI. I'd now like to expand on leasing trends and revenue collections. Starting with leasing activity, the strong trends we saw at the start of the quarter have become even stronger each month with a differentiated real estate product driving uniquely healthy demand we have not run any wide-scale concessions since the beginning of April. And new lease rate growth has picked up considerably during peak leasing season. In June and July, new lease rate growth was 4.6% and 4.9% respectively. At the same time, days to re-resident continues to compare favorably to prior year, improving five days year-over-year in the second quarter. With respect to renewal activity, our turnover rate continues to decline. Same-store turnover rate fell 16% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2020, bringing our same-store turnover rate to approximately 28% on a trailing 12 month basis. Renewal rents increased 3.5% in the second quarter and 3% in July. This resulted in same-store blended rent growth of 3.3% in the second quarter and 3.7% in July. The combination of lower turnover and lower days to re-resident continues to result in record high occupancy. In a typical year, we see occupancy decline seasonally in the summer months, but this summer we have seen occupancy rise. In July of 2020, same-store occupancy averaged 97.8%, a full 170 basis [ph] points higher than the previous July record set in 2019. Furthermore, 14 of our 16 markets had average occupancy above 97% in July. And eight of our markets had average occupancy above 98%. Next, I'll cover revenue collections, which have held up well since the beginning of the pandemic and improved further over the course of the second quarter. For context, pre-COVID, our total collections in a month represented 99% of billed revenue on average, with 96% representing payments of current month's rent and 3% representing payments from past due rents from prior months. In each month from April through July, we have seen payment of current month's rents amount to approximately 92% of billings compared to 96% historical average. As the pandemic has gone on, we have seen greater number of residents catch up on delayed payments from prior months. As a result, our overall collections as a percentage of monthly billings increased from 94% in April to 96% in May and 97% in each of June and July. This compares to our historical average of 99%. I'll close with a few remarks about how we're planning for the road ahead. We do not know what the future holds with respect to the spread of COVID-19, but we do know that it was our job to safely provide an outstanding experience for our residents and assure that they feel our genuine care, regardless of the obstacles. We've done so in the past during natural disasters, and we're doing so now during this pandemic. The key is to stay nimble and we're focused on leveraging the power of our people and our platform to adapt to future changes that are sure to come our way. With that, I'll turn it over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today, I will discuss the following topics: balance sheet and capital markets activity, investment activity, financial results for the second quarter and thoughts concerning the second half of 2020. With respect to the balance sheet, we improved our already strong liquidity position from last quarter. As of June 30, we had almost $1.6 billion in available liquidity. No debt maturing before 2022 in over half of our assets unencumbered. In the second quarter of 2020, we issued and sold 16.7 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $448 million. We used $150 million of the proceeds to repay the full balance outstanding on a revolving credit facility. We expect to use the remaining proceeds primarily to acquire homes. By funding acquisitions with proceeds from our equity raise, as well as cash flow operations and dispositions, we have the opportunity to achieve accretive external growth, at the same time that we reduce leverage on our balance sheet. As a reminder, we entered 2020 buying homes at a pace of approximately $200 million per quarter. Our acquisition volume in the second quarter was $46 million, as we temporarily paused the sourcing of new acquisitions in mid-March to monitor the impact of the pandemic. We have been very pleased with the resilience of our business since then, significant liquidity, no near-term refinancing needs, continued cash flow growth and strong demand for our product. Invitation Homes is on solid footing. As a result, we resume sourcing new acquisitions in June. While for-sale inventory levels remain tight, we have been successful in finding compelling acquisition opportunities by leveraging the advantages of our in-house local investment teams and proprietary AcquisitionIQ technology. Doing so, we've been able to ramp up our buying to a pace similar to pre-COVID levels. We also continue to sell homes in accordance with our 2020 disposition plan. In the second quarter, we sold 416 homes that did not fit within our long-term strategy for gross proceeds of $114 million. Next, I'll cover our financial results for the second quarter. Core FFO and AFFO per share for the second quarter increased 4.4% and 9.4%, year-over-year to $0.32 and $0.27 respectively. These results were driven primarily by higher same-store NOI and lower recurring CapEx. The impact of bad debt is included in both our core FFO and AFFO results. I'd like to take a moment to explain our policy for recognizing bad debt on past due amounts. All rental revenues and other property income for both our same-store and total portfolio are reflected net of bad debt. We reserve residents’ accounts receivables balances aged greater than 30 days as bad debt, as a resident's security deposit should cover the first 30 days of receivables. For all receivables balances aged greater than 30 days, we reserve as bad debt 100% of outstanding receivables from the resident, less the amount of their security deposit. For the purpose of receivables aging, charges are considered due based on the terms of the original lease, not based on any payment plan created. In other words, any past due rents that have not been paid that do not have a security deposit balance on hand to offset them are not recognized as revenue in our P&L, regardless of whether a payment plan has been negotiated with a resident. Those rents are later collected that will show up in revenue as a good guy in the period collected. We view our financial performance to-date as a testament to the resilience of our business model that is well positioned compared to many other real estate types for the world we are living in. We are pleased with the prospects for our business going forward, but it remains difficult to provide guidance for the second half of 2020 due to uncertainty concerning local, state and federal regulatory environments, as well as how the pandemic may continue to evolve. That said, we did want to share some thoughts about how we are thinking about the second half of 2020 comparing to our just completed second quarter. First, let me discuss items impacting revenue. In the first quarter, we recognized 40 basis points of bad debt. In the second quarter that grew to 190 basis points. If we continue to collect it approximately 97% of our billings per month, we would expect bad debt to remain elevated in the second half of the year. Another source of uncertainty is around other income, and more specifically late fees. In the second quarter, late fee income fell by a little over $3 million compared to last year. At this point, we continue to experience similar declines, and it remains to be seen how various regulations and restrictions may evolve. Helping to potentially offset these unfavorable variances are the possibility for continued lower turnover in days to re-resident, which were the two key drivers of our record-high occupancy in the first half of 2020.  As Charles mentioned, average occupancy was 170 basis points higher in July of this year versus last year, an excellent start for the second half of 2020. In addition, with more clarity in the near term, we continue to see solid growth in both our renewal and new lease rates over expiring leases.  Regarding expenses, I'll remind you that our control book expenses usually have some seasonality associated with them. We would expect our third quarter to have higher repairs and maintenance and turnover expenses compared to second quarter. As we previously discussed, we are back in the market, making offers on home acquisitions. Typically acquisitions in the second half of the year have minimal financial impact to the current year's results due to the time it takes to complete our initial renovation of an acquired home and for the first resident to move in.  Below the NOI line, we expect property management and G&A combined to be about $0.005 higher in each of the third and fourth quarters compared to the second quarter. Finally, with respect to financing costs, we expect interest expense to be about a $0.01 higher in each of the third and fourth quarters compared to the second quarter due to contractual increases in our step up swaps.  Average share count will also be higher in the third and fourth quarters compared to the second quarter when you take into account our June issuance of 16.7 million shares. Supplemental Schedule 2(a) includes share count information as of June 30. I will close by reiterating how proud we are of the way our corporate and field teams have executed thus far in 2020 and how great it is to see the positive impact we are having in our communities. We have a resilient business and a first-rate team of associates. We are pleased with our strong liquidity position, the quality of our real estate and the strength of our resident base. We are staying nimble to position our residents, associates, communities, and investors for success in both the near term and long term. With that, let's open up the line for Q&A.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from Sam Choe with Credit Suisse.
Sam Choe: Hi, guys. I'm on for Doug today. I mean, Ernie talked about the non-enforcement of late fees. I think Charles did, too. But I’m just kind of wondering at this point, how you're thinking about those resident friendly initiatives now versus when we started the pandemic and the going back to that late fee, does 2Q kind of offer that good run rate throughout the pandemic.
Charles Young: Yes, this is Charles. Thanks for your question. So just going back to where this thing started with the pandemic in March, we waived all of the late fees for April, just trying to be thoughtful with our residents. And then from there, we kind of took it on a month-by-month basis and tried to see how it all played out. So, come May and in June we started this slowly reintroduce. But really it was only with residents who we hadn't had a chance to interact with. And even when they did call us many times, we would waive those late fees. I would take them off the ledgers. The whole goal really was to try to get the communication going with our residents and make sure that we were interacting with them and working with them, so they can stay in their homes.  When you look at your point, when you looked at the landscape, about 1/3 of our homes fall into some form of restriction in regards to running late fees, and we're taking a very conservative position on that. As you know, it's a changing landscape and things are being extended. And so we're taking more of a conservative stance and we're keeping an eye on it. And like we said, we're still working with our residents if they reach out to us. Our main goal is to make sure that we're keeping our residents in our homes and trying to work with those who need help.
Sam Choe: Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. And we've seen collections normalized from April to July, I'm just wondering if there's any delays in that second stimulus package by Congress. Do you have a sense of how much of your resident population might be affected?
Charles Young: It's hard to see, have full visibility into that. We've liked our process that we've been able to stabilize, but it's really hard to see what it's going to do. The vast majority of our residents have been paying on time and continue to. So we'll keep an eye on it, but we like how we've been trending so far. 
Sam Choe: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.
Rich Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. Dallas, maybe this is just a strategy question for you. Look, it sounds like you're ramping up acquisitions. You like the markets that you're in. It looks like most of your markets did really well. Houston was a little bit weaker, but could you maybe just talk us through, how you're going to acquire homes given you already have a lot of density in your markets and there seems to be even more competition for single family homes on the other side of COVID-19 than prior to COVID-19. So, how are you going to do it and what markets do you like best?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Hi, Rich. A couple of points I'd like to make in response. First would be you're right that the market is relatively tight. There's limited supply, but even on that basis, we'll still see somewhere between $5.5 million and $6 million transactions over the next year. So in that environment, we were pretty good at being nimble and being local and on the ground and being able to stay flexible. We're also, as you know, pretty agnostic in terms of which channel they come through so long as they fit the profile of the property type that we want in the portfolio long term. We've actually had quite a bit of success in the one off space, being able to stay active locally in the markets, putting in offers on properties on a one by one basis. We've had a little bit more success in the last couple of months of doing some smaller opportunities with builders where we're buying five, 10, 15 homes at a time. And so while you're right in that it's a very competitive environment, given the lack of supply. The fact that we've been as active as we have been for the past eight years and been able to run our offense, so to speak, in the same fashion, we picked up right where we left off in terms of just slowing down our pace and getting right back into it. Ernie talked about our pace being in line with pre-COVID levels. And I would expect that we can certainly deploy capital in a meaningful way in that pace in today's environment.
Rich Hill: Okay. So any thoughts on specific markets or you're just going let it come as it may?
Dallas Tanner: Well, we've said this before, and I should have said this in response to your first question. So my apologies, but we managed 12,500 homes in Atlanta as efficiently as we manage 3,500 homes in Seattle. And so for us, we still feel like in the majorities of our footprints, we have the additional capacity to expand our scale and maybe even get better density. With that comes better services, a better understanding of how the portfolio is behaving and ultimately driving decision making toward what the customer wants. So the Sunbelt markets, the West part of the – Western coastal parts of our markets are all parts of the portfolio that we'd like to see some expansion in. We love what we have in Atlanta. It could even have more in a market like that if it makes sense. But there's not – it hasn't really been anything Rich that would say that we should shift our strategy. I mean, the demographics in the household formation in our Sunbelt and coastal markets are still two times the national average in terms of the household formation. All the fundamentals are saying that growth is going to continue to happen in those parts of the country. So we're bullish on continuing to build out our footprint in these markets.
Rich Hill: Got it. Thank you, Dallas. And Ernie, just a quick question for you. I appreciate the thoughts on 2H. What I heard was that fundamentals remain very solid, maybe not accelerating from what we saw in 2Q, but very solid. But I also look at your bad debt policy, and it strikes me as quite conservative. So is it fair to say fundamentals are going to maintain from where they are. But maybe you'll get a little bit of bad debt back as you collect unpaid rent.
Ernie Freedman: Yes, Rich, I hope that's the case. And there's always seasonality in the business, but seasonality is probably going to be a little skewed this year, just because of what's been happening around the pandemic. As you saw, we saw accelerating fundamentals on the new lease side, and it's rare for us to have increasing, excuse me, occupancy through the summer months, because typically you have higher turnover there. So that's all pointing favorably to us and with our bad debt policy, we gave a lot of consideration around what to do with folks who are on payment plans. About a third of our receivable balances are on payment plans, and most of those residents are paying. And because of the way our policy is set up today, we are reserving for future, hopefully payments from those folks. If we have another three or six months worth of history, which we will as the year rounds out, and we see people continue to do well on those payment plans, they'll certainly give us a pause and reason to consider revisiting our policy with around bad debt. If we see those people playing, but we wanted to be a little more conservative at this point in time, because we only have a couple months of history at this point, the pandemic is only about four months old. But we'd like to think we took a conservative view on it, and that maybe we'll do a little bit better if people continue to make good on their payment plans like we're seeing the vast majority of folks do.
Rich Hill: Yes. Thank you guys. Congrats on weathering a really tough environment.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you. Rich. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey guys. Good morning, down there.
Dallas Tanner: Hi, Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste: So my first question is with occupancy and retention at all time highs – new all time highs and favorable demand and pricing power clearly at hand. You guys are in a very advantageous position. What's the operating strategy from here? Are you inclined to continue to push rates more aggressively and perhaps later into the year than you typically would? As you say, we had 98% is occupied? And can we see further new and renewal pricing accelerations beyond July and into the fall?
Charles Young: Hey, Haendel. Charles here. Thanks for the question. We – early on in the pandemic, we knew we were solving for occupancy. We wanted to make sure not knowing what the future had. We ran concessions early, got our occupancy up, and then we saw that demand is here for our product. And so we continue to throw the move those away. So by May, we were fully free of concessions and we began to see a new lease rate growth. So when you look at the results for June and July 4.6, 4.9, we're seeing good acceleration on the new rate growth and our high accuracy allows us to have that position.  Now on the renewal side, we've been a bit more balanced knowing that residents are – some of our residents are in challenging positions, and we showed some flexibility in working with them. So you see our renewal rates positive, but not as high as they'd been historically. But we're starting to push that a bit now. And so our ask going into August is close to close to 5%, September over 5%. So we're finding that balance. Again, it is a seasonal business and we're watching this and we're getting towards the end of the peak season. So we'll continue to monitor. We have our deal teams and our revenue management teams are great, keeping our eye on what the dynamics are in each sub market. And right now we're always trying to find out proper balance and taking into account what's going on with the pandemic as well. But our portfolio is in strong position.
Haendel St. Juste: That's great, Charles. And the clarification on that last point, you said, you're asking 5% what are you generally getting or what's that spread been? Just curious on how that's translating into what you're receiving or expect to receive?
Charles Young: It's hard to predict in this market. Usually, we get 50 basis points to a 100 basis points. But in the pandemic, we're still working with families. So it's hard to put a specific number on it. September our ask was closer to 5.5. And so, we're going to be higher than the three, 3.5 we've been in the last several months. As you know, we're coming out at a higher ask. So we'll have to see. The spread is hard to predict during this period, but typically it's within 50 basis points to a 100 basis points.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. My second question is on the days to re-residents, can you break that down into two pieces of the turn times and then the time to lease? And then I guess I'm curious, if you sit here at 98% occupancy, how much higher can it get from a turn time perspective? Are you getting close to that optimal number where 98% just structurally has less upside, or how should we think about the potential upside from here on the turn times, et cetera?
Charles Young: Yes. So taking your first question or your second question first, we always thought that this business could be a 97% occupancy business. As we looked at trending our turn times our turnover down into the 25% to 30%. We've been trending down to that, that way over the last kind of several quarters, which has been really positive. And as we get days of re-resident to the 30s, you just do the math and that's going to have you at a number that's where we are today. Now what's happening a little faster, given the pandemic. So that's a good thing, and we're going to continue to pay attention to that. Days to re-resident has been a real bright spot for us. It was a focus for us since the beginning of the year. We knew we had an opportunity there. And as I said, we're – quarter-over-quarter, we're down five days and we continue to have that benefit in July. We're down closer to 10 days in July. And you break down the components. We've been turning how homes we've made really good improvement this year at about 10 days. And the remainder has been the move-in period. So it's been healthy. The teams are doing all the right things, can't thank them enough, really impressed by their ability to work through this. And as they look at it, it's been a combination of pre-leasing and getting renovated, inventory and really pricing things appropriately. So I thank them for all the hard work and we'll continue to push.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you. That's fantastic. And best of luck.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate the color at the beginning of the call about the new residents moving from more dense urban areas. When you look at those residents, is there anything different in terms of either their age or if they have children relative to your typical residence?
Charles Young: Yes, we haven't really seen any material difference in regards to the demographics. Nothing has really stood out there. We did this survey, as Dallas mentioned in his remarks to figure out where people were trying to come from. And anecdotally, there's a demand to have more space. And that's been our long-term demographic has been over half of our residents are families. They have pets. And so they are appreciating the extra space. And I think during the pandemic, the social distancing is a benefit as well. And about just shy of 30% were coming from the cities. And many of them are just looking to try to have that space. So – but in terms of the demographic change, we haven't seen it. We'll continue to monitor, but it's still early in the process.
Nick Joseph: You wouldn't expect any kind of turnover differential as those leases expire that it may be more a temporary renter versus what you traditionally see.
Charles Young: I don't think so. But we're going to watch that. At our current turnover rates, our residents are staying on average three years and it seems to be expanding. And if we continue to do what we do and give them a great resident experience with genuine care. And we know that we have homes in great neighborhoods and we're good school districts, all that is why residents want to be in our homes and they're staying for a long period of time. So we'll continue to monitor. As we said, demand has been strong. So we'll watch that as we go.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Dallas, you talked about the transaction market. Maybe just the flip side of that, potentially asset sales. You've obviously announced you exit Nashville. You're almost out of there. Are there any other markets you may potentially exit? You look at the Midwest market, Chicago and Minneapolis, you have fewer homes than you do in most of your other markets?
Dallas Tanner: Sure. We're really comfortable with what we own today. We like the footprints that we have. You're right in the Midwest over the last couple of years. We have cooled down the size of our portfolio specifically in Chicago. Some of that comes with some of the local expertise that we have that center around, the difficulties in operating properties in certain parts of that market. But – by and far, largely Nick we're pretty comfortable with what we have, like the footprint that we've got, and we'll obviously do some culling of nonperforming assets, maybe some geographic dislocation that we're always working on.  But now, by and large, we're pretty comfortable with where we're at. I wouldn't expect us to do anything wholesale, at least the way we're thinking about things right now. 
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jade Rahmani with KBW.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you're actively exploring any joint venture opportunities in adjacent home types or markets in order to expand the platform at scale and accelerate growth.
Dallas Tanner: Good question. Jade. It's one that we get from time-to-time. I think we talked a little bit about this over similar meetings at Nareit. I think ultimately, we were very happy with the smaller equity offering we did earlier in the quarter to given us some additional flexibility to go out and grow our portfolio. JV opportunities, we get inquiries inbounds on some of those from time to time. And certainly something that we think about in terms of having an added resource or an added tool to maybe go out and acquire more properties, or be maybe more active in parts of markets where we feel we have sufficient exposure on our balance sheet. So that's something that we'll continue to consider and think through. But as of right now, we're in a really good position. We've got plenty of dry powder to continue to grow our portfolio in parts of markets that we think lend themselves to really solid risk-adjusted returns. So we're in a good position.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks very much. I'm wondering to find out if you could also provide any update as to the company's property management platform, is it at this point transitioned to a fully proprietary platform? Or would you describe it as a combination of services from multiple vendors?
Dallas Tanner: Well, we've been internal from day one. So we put an emphasis as we built the business around making sure that we were 100% internally managed and all of our folks that centered in and around the management and the tenant relations, we're all internal. Now, we certainly use vendors and we use vendor networks to do about half of our service orders in today's environment, Jade. So the short answer would be, we are an internally managed platform, but we definitely do use vendors on the outside, particularly around roofs and HVAC and some of those things in terms of heavier list. But most of our small maintenance work, work orders and everything that we do through ProCare are all handled internally as well.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks very much.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Jade.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC.
Wes Golladay: Hi, good morning everyone. I just want to go back to that resident move-in survey. You looked like people are moving in from urban environments, but I'm just wondering if any region stood out to you and did you see a lot of out-of-state migration?
Dallas Tanner: There wasn't really any standout per market. It was – we were surveying recently moved in residents. And so, it's a – kind of a short burst of a survey. And so, no real standout in regards to certain markets showing more of a propensity than others. But overall, I think, there's – there's been a strong interest. And you can see it from our overall demand that's in the market right now. And so, we'll stay there.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then I just want to go back to the bad debt reserve. Was that heavily skewed towards June because it seems like residents are just a little bit slower, but kind of near normal levels. Is that the correct way to look at it?
Dallas Tanner: Well, I guess, Wes, when we look at it on a quarterly basis and so you can see our collection activity improved throughout the quarter. And we're generally running about the same amount in the current bucket, 0 to 30 buckets. It's hard to say it's skewed toward June, but certainly as you get to June, your May receivables announced are now – that are still outstanding are eligible for bad debt as or your April. So, we saw kind of earned in throughout the period. So it's hard to say it's skewed one way or the other, but if we continue to collect it about 97%, it certainly feels like we're going to have bad debt kind of in that range that you saw in the second quarter. And hopefully, we can do better than that. But with four months of data, that's how we can look at the world today.
Wes Golladay: Okay, thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Wes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Kalmus with Zelman and Associates.
Alex Kalmus: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Given SFR’s outperformance during the pandemic, there appears to be renewed interest from traditional real estate funds in the space. What is your impression of increased competition from private equity and potential consolidation of some of the more mid-sized players?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, the industry continues to evolve. And I think we're still in this moment of new capital coming into the space, we grew with everything that you're saying. They're trying to build portfolios and trying to replicate what companies like Invitation Homes have already done. We welcome it at the end of the day because we think having quality of choice and more companies offering professional services are good thing for residents generally across the country. I think this will be a good value added – added an industry, and there's a lot of healthy demand out there that wants to take advantage of it. Selfishly, the way we think about the business, we also think that over time and distance, it may lend itself to some consolidation opportunities. We believe we can run a portfolio as well or better than anyone out there today. And we think we can offer a customer experience of second to none because of our scale. So I think all of this new capital coming into the space over time and distance will largely be viewed as a good thing. And it's beneficial to our company as well.
Alex Kalmus: Thank you for the color. And I know you guys are channel agnostic, but right now what would you say is the most abundant channel for your acquisition pipeline?
Dallas Tanner: We're very active in the one-off space, working with iBuyers, working with people that are selling their home. I think those markets continue to get more and more efficient. So it doesn't feel right. First of all, let's be clear. There's not a lot of distress in the marketplace, which is a healthy sign for housing so far. So it is the traditional transaction side of things. And then I think there's opportunities to do more with builders along the way and find ways to see redevelopment of infill locations that would fit our portfolio needs as well. So the most active being the traditional one-off sales right now.
Alex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.
John Pawlowski: Hi, thanks a lot. Charles, as some of your local economies have had to walk back reopening plans in recent weeks and recent months. I'm just curious if any specific markets are starting to show some fatigue either in renewal negotiations on rate or collection trends, obviously very strong across the portfolio, but just any markets you’re concerned that’s standing up – standing out heading into the summer.
Charles Young: Yes, this is Charles. Really, we haven't seen anything that gives us any major concern. Like you said, across the board we're doing really well. And what I did do is take a minute to look at some of the States where we've seen an increase in the number of COVID cases, which is Arizona, Texas, Florida, a little bit of California. And as I dug in there, occupancy blended rent growth are all accelerating from June to July, which is positive. The renewal rates to your question have continued to look good year-over-year and Q2, all of them were up. Phoenix is at an all-time high. July seems to be holding up really well. New lease growth in Phoenix is over 9%, NorCal 8%, SoCal 6%, even at Florida we're 5, 6 – 5.6% for July new lease growth. And then the other piece I've looked at is on the collection side. And all of those markets are Arizona, Texas, Florida, specifically collected more revenue in July versus June. California is the exception, but we know that we're dealing with some more of the regulatory challenges, but it's not far off. It's like really flat kind of over year-over-year 99% of what it was in June versus July. So, really haven't seen much. We're still seeing overall good demand and – but we're going to continue to monitor as we watch this thing play out.
John Pawlowski: Okay. That makes sense. And then just curious for your longer term outlook, three, five year outlook on South Florida. It's been a market that’s lagged the rest of your portfolio, even pre-COVID. So if you could prune yourself Florida portfolio today, overnight, what percentage of the homes would you sell?
Dallas Tanner: Hi, I'll take this one. Well, first of all, South Florida is an interesting market to your point. I mean, it tends to kind of flow in cycles as you well know. We actually really enjoy the portfolio – the size of the portfolio that we have. It makes it very efficient. It's been a little lackluster in terms of rate growth and there's some challenges in a couple of municipal areas. We have been calling that portfolio over the past couple of years kind of fine tuning it to some degree, similar to what we've done in Chicago. We love the growth profile. We love the inbound when things are good. I don't know what the exact right size might be, John, over time and distance. We're certainly still recycling capital and occasionally buying in South Florida. We love the parts of North Dade and South Broward County. We've had a lot of success in and around Jupiter and some of those sub-markets as well. So I believe it's a market we're going to be active in for a long time. And you might see us over time maybe slowly cull parts of that market just to make it a bit more efficient, but nothing worries us about the scale, getting that we're also a little bit underwhelmed by some of the growth that we see on the rate side. But it feels like our teams are doing a really good job there. We've actually seen all the efficiency metrics that Charles talked about earlier and get better and better in that market. So I like our chances. We probably want to run that portfolio for a bit longer before making any kind of definitive thoughts around what we would or wouldn't do there.
John Pawlowski: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alua Askarbek with Bank of America.
Alua Askarbek: Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions today. I just have two few – two quick questions, so just following up on the renewal rate. So you're saying that you guys don't really have any markets right now where you're limited on renewal rent increases like the multi-family guys.
Charles Young: Yes, we do have certain markets and we're following all of those rules where it does stand out, Washington being one of them. California has some limitations as well, but that – they’re – and that is reflected in some of our numbers, but generally we are going out at [indiscernible] and then allowing our local teams to work directly with the residents to try to get to a resolution that works for both of us. But we're going to follow every time that there is any type of restriction that's – either put in locally or by the state.
Alua Askarbek: Got it. Okay. And then just a quick question on move-outs. I know turnover is really low and occupancy is really high, but have you seen an increase in move-outs for home ownership specifically during the quarter with mortgage rates really low? Is there any more interest in that?
Charles Young: Yes, historically we've been trending in the mid-20s and we saw this quarter, Q2, a slight uptick, it's 27. So it's not a huge jump. And obviously with interest rates, as you mentioned at historic rates, we'll continue to monitor that, but it's been in our benefit.
Alua Askarbek: Got it. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.
Rich Skidmore: Good morning. Dallas just a quick question just with regards to how to think about the capital recycling selling more homes than purchasing? How do you think about a) how that might trend as you go forward? And b) how we should think about financial impact of the divestitures versus the purchases? Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Yes, great question. So, on the – on your first point, I would say, it's important to understand that we rank every one of our homes in the portfolio on an ongoing basis. And there's a number of factors, but they all basically fall into two buckets. We rank our assets based on where they're located, which is, as you might imagine, pretty hard to change wherever home is and it currently sits today. And then we also rank our homes on an asset score that basically ties into the fit and finish and the property characteristics that are associated with that property. Our asset management team does a really nice job of going deep at the market and also at the sub-market level. We've built our portfolio into about 220 sub-markets, geographic clusters that we measure performance in and around. And so, as part of our ordinary course, we'll go through those properties and basically hold ourselves accountable to their performance, both from an operating perspective and also from a return perspective, how do we think about the growth profile for those assets. Now, there's a lot of reasons why you would sell a home. One, you might sell a home because quite frankly becomes too valuable. And to your second question, on a financial basis, it may make sense to sell that home back into the end user market, recycle capital and reinvest in parts of the market where it could make more sense. The second reason might be geographically, we feel like we either have too much concentration and we'd like to spread that risk as well for a variety of reasons. So our management team – our asset management teams, as part of our capital allocation plan every year, we'll go through that process. And we have kind of a general property watch list of things that we're looking at for potential reasons as to why we might sell. And then they're also coming up with recommendations around where we think we need a bit more scale. And that's all part of that recycling process to answer your question.
Ernie Freedman: So, Rich, this is Ernie. So, I think, with the equity raise we did in June, it give us the opportunity in the second half of the year to pivot to net external growth. As Dallas talked about, we're always going to be a seller. We're always going to look to try to take those assets – those homes that just don't make sense for us long-term. And we've been selling at a pretty steady pace here for the last few quarters plus or minus $75 million to $100 million worth of homes. But with the equity raise and having $600 million of cash almost on our balance sheet as of June 30th, and as we talked about in the prior remark, it gives us a chance to ramp back up our acquisition pipeline to where it was pre-COVID, which was about a couple of hundred million dollars per quarter. So that hopefully puts us in a position in the second half of the year to be a net acquirer of homes versus – or in the first of the half of the year is a little bit more of a net seller.
Rich Skidmore: If you were to maintain kind of the net seller sort of perspective that you've been running out over the last couple of quarters, is that how dilutive to the near-term earnings? Or how do you think about dilution accretion in that trade-off of the capital recycling?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, the good news for us, Rich, is where we're selling our assets and typically an asset we're selling it to an end user will set bank it on our books for anywhere between two to four months just to go through the normal sale process. The cap rates we sell out to end users typically are well below 4%. It can be in the 3% to 4% range. A lot of things that Dallas talked about the fact that house might be worth more to an end user than as a rental property. Whereas when we go to buy homes, we're typically buying today kind of in the mid fives cap rate, and that's in a market where there isn't distress. And that's where we've been buying for the last period of time. So our capital recycling unlike in other real estate types even though we're improving the quality of our portfolio and getting in better locations tends to be a net accretive activity for us from an earnings perspective because we have the opportunity to sell assets in two ways to end users who may value them differently than an institution, who runs them as a rental property.
Rich Skidmore: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: Hi, thanks. Just to get a finer point on cap rates. You guys have been buying in that 5.4% range in the last couple quarters. Do you see that edging lower maybe due to higher price points over the coming months? Or maybe rents are raising enough to keep that cap rate at that level?
Charles Young: It – to Ernie’s earlier point, it's been pretty consistent in the kind of that mid fives generally for us over the past couple of years. And we've, specifically, been pretty picky about what we're willing to put in the portfolio. We're seeing rising rate, which does help to your point, but I would expect it to kind of stay in that mid fives. I wouldn't expect that we see any real wholesale or dramatic shifts given the type of home that we buy in and the types of portfolio that we manage today. It all feels pretty, pretty good, kind of in that strength. And to Ernie’s earlier point, on one of the questions he answered, we tend to see some better buying opportunities typically in the back half of the year. Now, this year has been anything but typical and housing cycles may extend further and home buying and selling season later in the year, but we'll see – we'll manage and we'll watch how the next six months progressing, but generally speaking mid-fives is something that we feel pretty comfortable with.
Todd Stender: Okay, that's helpful. And just looking at leverage, you've been using equity lately to pay down the line, that's helped your debt-to-EBITDA level drop into the low-seven times range. How much more movement should we see your leverage metrics move? 
Dallas Tanner: I think they're going to be more or less hold steady. We're using the capital that we raised here in June and more of the capital is going to be used for acquiring assets and for de-leveraging. So I think you'll see a steady out. And a lot of it's going to depend on how EBITDA plays out in the second half of the year. How things like bad debt trend and other like as good news, we're seeing good fundamentals, a good strong growth, otherwise in our portfolio when it comes to rental rate achievement, when it comes to occupancy. So I think we'll continue to see that modest moving down that you've seen over the last period of time. You stay focused on that. And as we have – if it makes sense opportunistically to be able to try to do something with leverage, we'll certainly consider that. But our main focus is going to be to continue to delever through external growth in terms of buying assets unlevered, which is what we've been doing for a period of time here and it takes a little while for that to earn in. That's going to be the main focus. And then the second focus will be, hopefully, we continue to see positive NOI contribution and EBITDA growth as we move forward.
Todd Stender: Thank you.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. And I would like to hand the call back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: We appreciate everybody's interest in Invitation Homes. We hope that everybody out there stays safe and we’ll look forward to talking to you all next quarter. Thanks.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-09 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Invitation Homes First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Greg Van Winkle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greg Van Winkle: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On today's call from Invitation Homes are Dallas Tanner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer. I would like to point everyone to our first quarter 2020 earnings press release and supplemental information, which we may reference on today's call. This document can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. I would also like to inform you that certain statements made during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements. They're subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including the potential negative impact of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, on our business, employees, residents and our ability to operate our business. Future impact to the operation is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The extent of the impact will depend on future developments, including actions taken to contain and mitigate COVID-19 outbreak. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. During this call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, in our earnings release and supplemental information which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dallas Tanner.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you, Greg. I want to start by saying I sincerely hope all of you listening are doing well and staying safe. Invitation Homes' mission to provide quality housing for American families impacts many stakeholders, including our residents, associates, vendors, communities and investors. I could not be prouder of the way our teams have embodied our core values of genuine care and standout citizenship to keep these stakeholders safe and bring stability to residents' lives with a comforting home and a friendly experience. On today's call, Charles and Ernie will provide an update on our results and financial position, but I'd like to begin by telling you what we are focused on as a management team. First and foremost is health and safety. Our homes are ports in the storm for thousands of families, making it our duty to continue serving residents through this pandemic. To perform this duty safely, we implemented important precautions early on. For prospective residents, we are relying on self-showings by utilizing our Smart Home technology and keyless entry systems. For current residents, we are making every effort to fulfill critical service needs while ensuring safety measures, including deferral of nonemergency service trips, health and wellness verification for residents, service techs and vendors before visiting homes, and observation of social distancing best practices in all of our resident and associate interactions. While our focus on health and safety begins with physical health, it also includes financial health. We have created appropriate solutions to financial hardship for those who need it. This includes payment plans without late fees for residents who require flexibility to meet their rental obligations over time and a voluntary moratorium on evictions. The second important focus area I'll address is the financial well-being of our company. We entered the pandemic in a position of strength with record high occupancy, significant liquidity available to us and 0 debt maturing before 2022. We also entered the pandemic knowing that our business had several differentiators that might work in our favor despite the uncertain environment. First, we provide the essential human need of housing and a leasing lifestyle that we believe is even more attractive versus other housing alternatives in times of uncertainty. Second, as you know, we have been purposeful about assembling an infill portfolio in locations where we expect greater resilience to economic cycles. Third, the residents we serve, on average, came into the pandemic with two wage earners per household, generating income of almost $110,000 that covered rent obligations by 5x. And fourth, we operate a high-margin business. Despite these positive differentiators, we took certain steps beginning in mid-March to further strengthen our operating and financial position, not knowing exactly how things might unfold. These actions included prioritizing occupancy, which climbed to a record high 97.2% in April; drawing roughly one-quarter of our revolver to increase working capital; and pushing pause temporarily on sourcing new acquisitions. Based on how well our business performed in March and April, it appears that the positive differentiators of our business and the additional COVID-specific steps we took to strengthen our position are working favorably to this point in the pandemic. Shelter-in-place has not impacted our ability to lease homes. In fact, residents have been moving into our portfolio at a similar rate to last year and at a greater rate than they have been moving out. Both renewal and new lease rate growth remained positive in April and occupancy reaches all-time highs. On this higher potential revenue base, we collected rents at over 95% of our typical collection rate in April, and are tracking even better in May than we were in April through the fifth day of the month. The third area we are focused on is staying close to information on the ground in our markets. Our platform has been purpose-built to provide real-time feedback. Our teams from operations management to customer service reps, maintenance supervisors and investment directors are in-house and local. This on-the-ground presence has served us well in navigating fast-changing scenarios like natural disasters in the past, and we've been able to leverage our playbook from these past events to help our teams identify and quickly adapt to rapid changes in each of our markets today. We believe our local presence and agility should also benefit us as we emerge on the other side of this pandemic with more clarity about the future. I will say a few more words at the end of our prepared remarks, but at this time, I would like to turn it over to Charles Young, our Chief Operating Officer.
Charles Young: Thank you, Dallas. First, I want to say thank you to our teams. We've asked our associates to be nimble and execute on the rapidly changing protocols, and they’ve delivered. In fact, resident satisfaction has continued its upward trend even in the face of COVID-19 challenges, with our survey scores near all-time highs in April. I'm grateful to be leading a team in the field that cares so deeply about our mission. The selflessness they continue to demonstrate is inspiring. In my remarks, I will touch briefly on our first quarter operating results before turning to the operational impact we have experienced so far from COVID-19. Same-store core revenues in the first quarter of 2020 grew 4.5% year-over-year. The increase was driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 3.9%, a 20 basis point increase over average occupancy to 96.7% and a 13.5% increase in other property income net of resident recoveries. Same-store core expense growth in the quarter was 5.3%. This resulted in same-store NOI growth of 4%, better than our expectation for the quarter. We are now operating in a very different environment than we were for the most of the first quarter due to COVID-19. I'd like to provide some detail on the impact we have seen, focusing on 3 areas in particular. First, I will address our occupancy, which is a record high. Second, I will discuss rent collections, which we are pleased with so far. And third, I will touch on revenue management and leasing trends, where move-ins are outpacing move-outs. I will then close by putting these trends into context as we think about the future. Starting with occupancy, we entered the pandemic from a position of strength. As the pandemic evolved, occupancy climbed even higher and a streak of sequential occupancy increases that begun in October continued each month all the way through April. In April, same-store average occupancy was an all-time high 97.2%, 60 basis points higher than last year, with 12 of our 16 markets averaging 97% or greater. Our total portfolio average occupancy also reached a record high in April of 95.4%. Next, I will cover rent collections. In both April and May, we’ve placed a voluntary moratorium on evictions and created payment plans for those experiencing financial hardship as a result of COVID-19. Even with these measures of genuine care in place for our residents, our collection rate in April was over 95% of our historical average. Less than 2% of our residents requested to defer a portion of their April rent to future periods. Collections have improved further since the end of April. Of the 5% shortfall in April rent collections versus historical average, approximately half of those outstanding rents have come through to us already in collections after the month closed. Through the 5th day of May, our May collection rate was over 100% of our pre-COVID historical average. This puts us at almost 109% of where we were at this point in April, as April's collections rate was 92% of historical average at day 5 before accelerating to over 95% by the end of the month. I will now turn to an update on our leasing trends and strategy. With respect to renewal activity, our turnover rate is showing signs of declining. In March, turnover was flat year-over-year. In April, our same-store turnover rate was 2.2%, down from 2.5% in April 2019. We achieved rate increases on renewals of 4.2% and 4.1% for March and April, respectively. As a reminder, most residents who moved out in March and April gave notice prior to the spread of COVID-19. But the pandemic has likely been a greater factor in renewal decisions for residents with leases expiring in May. It is too early for the data to be definitive with respect to May turnover, but at this time, we see it trending in the right direction. Stepping back, we believe that our turnover should perform better in difficult environments compared to other residential sectors, as our residents stay longer, renew more often and are typically families that demonstrate stickier behavior with respect to housing choices. Now I will turn to details on new leases. In early March, to proactively position our portfolio for COVID-related uncertainty, we began incorporating concessions into our pricing strategy to prioritize the lease-up of vacant homes. As the pandemic unfolded, we were able to gauge its impact in April. We saw strong move-in velocity that was even better than expected. In March, we signed 2,260 new leases with same-store new lease rent growth -- rate growth of 3.2%, including the impact of concessions. In April, we signed 2,099 new leases with same-store new lease rate growth of 1% net of concessions. Furthermore, day 3 resident in March and April improved by 4 days and 2 days, respectively, compared to last year. Because we experienced such strong uptake that helped drive occupancy meaningfully higher, we’ve now reduced the concessions we are offering, but remain laser-focused on performance indicators and are ready to be nimble as necessary. Overall, our same-store blended rent growth for March and April was 3.9% and 3.2%, respectively. I will now close with a few remarks to help put things in context. Thus far, revenues have remained relatively healthy overall. We are happy with how solid rent growth -- rent collections have been, and record occupancy has been a further positive. Rental rates and leasing volumes so far have also performed well. We like our high-quality, sticky resident base, and we believe that the ripple effects of this pandemic could make the option to lease a single-family home even more attractive relative to other housing alternatives, especially versus those with greater density of units and shared amenities. As we navigate the uncertainty of the pandemic, though, it is important that we remain nimble and continue to leverage our local market insights to react judiciously. Our outstanding team in the field has done a great job of that so far as they work to keep people safe, provide genuine care to residents and position our company to maximize results and mitigate risk. With that, I will turn it over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer.
Ernest Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today, I will discuss two topics: first, financial results for the first quarter; and second, our liquidity position. I will begin with our financial results. Core FFO and AFFO per share for the first quarter increased 4.4% and 5.1% year-over-year to $0.34 and $0.29, respectively. These results exceeded our expectations. As Dallas and Charles described, we continue to see positive signs in the business and believe we’ve a differentiated model that is well-equipped versus many other types of commercial and residential real estate for the road ahead. That said, we are withdrawing our 2020 guidance due to uncertainty regarding the future economic impact of COVID-19. Regarding our liquidity, we entered the current period in a strong position. We have almost $1.1 billion in available liquidity, no debt maturing before 2022 and minimal near-term investing commitments. Our almost $1.1 billion of liquidity consists of $345 million of fully unrestricted cash and $730 million of capacity on our credit facility as of April 30. As we think about our liquidity needs going forward, we are focused in three areas: first, operating cash flow considerations; second, investing cash flow considerations; and third, financing cash flow considerations. With regard to operating cash flow, the two primary risks relate to occupancy levels and rent collections. The good news is that we are seeing positive results with respect to both. First, with occupancy, we’ve seen continuous increases since the start of the pandemic and demand that is stronger than this time last year. Although we are early into this new part of the economic cycle, our thesis with respect to the attractive nature of our product type and the stickiness of our residents appears to be playing out. Rent collections have also been a positive story. We came into April with a very low amount of past rents due to us. And as Charles described, our collections in April and to this point in May have been solid. Also as a reminder, we retain a security deposit from every resident, typically equal to 1 month's rent when they sign their initial lease, and these deposits total $152 million as of April 30. These deposits are not included in the $345 million unrestricted cash and almost $1.1 billion of liquidity I referenced earlier, but would be available to us to cover shortfalls in rent payments if necessary. While rent collections have remained high to date, we’ve completed internal stress tests to help guide us to actions that may be considered if rent collections were to decrease. In these scenarios, the high-margin nature of our business and our low dividend payout ratio helps serve as a buffer. Moving on to investing cash flow. Our business has some unique advantages that help us mitigate risk. First, we are not engaged in any development activity. Second, the granular nature of our assets allows us to be nimble with our investment activity, ramping up or down quickly to adapt to changes in risk reward. After closing $28 million of acquisitions in April, we have only $19 million of acquisitions in our pipeline beyond April and have temporarily paused putting new homes under contract. At the same time, we've remained active selling homes that have been earmarked for disposition, with $31 million of dispositions in April and another $59 million under contract to close after April, and more in our pipeline being prepared for sale. While we do not know what the future may hold, the housing market remains open with healthy transaction volumes at present. I will also point out that we can ramp up acquisition activity just as quickly as we brought it down. While we continue to stay on the sidelines as we assess risks and market conditions today, we will be able to pivot quickly to resume buying when the time is right. I will now address financing needs and capital markets risk. While capital markets have been volatile and challenging for new issuance in certain channels, we do not have any near-term refinancing needs. As a result of our proactive refinancing over the last several years, we have 0 debt maturing prior to 2022, and weighted average years to maturity of 4.7 years as of March 31. 51% of our homes are unencumbered. Our other approximately 39,000 homes are pledged as collateral for nonrecourse-secured debt of $6.6 billion or 76% of our total debt. On a trailing 12-month basis, these homes generated cash flow that covered debt service by 3.1x. Outside of secured debt, the remainder of our debt consists primarily of a term loan and revolving credit in our unsecured facility. Covenants on this facility leave cushion for an almost 60% drop in EBITDA and an almost 50% drop in total asset value, as measured by broker price opinions. Schedule 2(b) in our supplemental has been updated to include additional detail related to our unsecured facility covenants. In summary, we’ve a safe balance sheet today. We are pleased with our strong liquidity position, the quality of our real estate, the strength of our resident base and how the business has performed through the pandemic thus far. Before we open the call up for Q&A, I want to hand it back to Dallas for some final remarks.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Ernie. On today's call, we focus more on the near-term than we typically do. Appropriately so, given the importance of the measures we've taken to navigate the current environment with safety and prudence. However, I would be remiss if I didn't spend some time talking about the big picture for Invitation Homes. Our long-term growth story remains intact, and I am confident we will emerge from the pandemic in a position of strength, ready to run again. We continue to have conviction that we offer a differentiated product and living experience, catering to the large percentage of the U.S. population that wishes to live in a single-family home while enjoying the flexibility and convenience of leasing from a professional property manager. That thesis has been validated in the strength of our demand, as evidenced by our leasing trends for the past several years. Demographics point to continued growth in single-family leasing demand over the next decade. The events being experienced in the world today do not change that. And it is possible that they will have a lasting impact that drives Americans to place an even greater value on the space and distance from neighbors that single-family living naturally provides. The locations and high-quality nature of our homes and service further differentiate our resident experience, which we continue to refine and see runway to make even better. While our front lines have been focused on safely serving residents, our strategy and ancillary growth teams have not stopped making progress on important projects behind the scenes. We remain on track with preparations for our next-generation of ancillary services, and have put ourselves in a position to pilot some of these opportunities at the appropriate time. We also continue to monitor each of our acquisition channels very closely. When we gain more clarity in our footing and the market dynamics, we will be ready to resume acquisitions in a disciplined fashion. We look forward to returning to a more normal environment, but the passion we bring to supporting residents will prevail regardless of circumstance. The last 2 months have renewed my conviction in the strength and resilience of our people and of our platform. I could not be happier with how we have responded to the pandemic. Let me be clear. These are unprecedented and uncertain times, but we like how we've performed so far. Of all the types of real estate that could be owned, we are happy that single-family homes are what we own today. Lastly, in times like today, it's natural to reflect on what matters to you most, your core values and your mission. Our mission statement says, “Together with you, we make a house a home,” and that resonates with me today more than ever. Many of our residents are health care professionals and first responders. And it's our absolute honor to support these heroes and alleviate a small amount of stress by providing them with comfortable, well-maintained homes they can return to at the end of the day to recharge and be with their loved ones. We are all feeling some form of disruption in our lives today and deserve the stability that a home can provide. We are proud of the exceptional job our teams have done, adapting to the challenges around them to continue helping residents make a house a home. With that, let's open up the line for question and answer.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mr. Johnston, your line is open. You may be muted on your end.
Derek Johnston: Hi. Yes, I was. Thank you very much. Hi, guys. Good morning. So you are in a unique position with regard to self guided tours of properties and, presumably, meeting the social distancing standards of today. Has this been an active channel? And what percentage of the portfolio is able to accommodate self guided tours? And what percentage of self guided tours are you actually closing on?
Charles Young: Yes. So this is Charles. Thanks for the question. What -- our advantage has been that we implemented the Smart Home technology in self-show tours years ago. And currently, about 60% of our portfolio has the capability and 100% of our on-the-market homes have the self-show capability. It's been our main channel in which how we show homes, given the kind of spread nature. And our talented leasing agents are able to utilize the technology to make sure that residents get to see as many homes as they need to and -- but at the same time, if they need to work with one of our agents, we will provide that as well. So to your last question, the majority of our homes are going through the self-show. Now not everybody is comfortable with that. And so at times, we'll do a in-person tour. But given the pandemic, we made adjustments where we would open the home for a resident ahead of time, and then wait for them outside trying to adhere to the self -- the social distancing guidelines. So we made some pivots, but it really wasn't a major pivot for us because this is a core way in which we operate our business on the leasing side.
Derek Johnston: Got it. That’s very helpful. Thanks. And just switching gears quickly for my second one. I think Charles mentioned it. Can you discuss the previous concessions that were in place for new leases, maybe even the nuances by market and kind of where they stand today? Thank you.
Charles Young: Yes. This is Charles again. Thanks for the question. Yes. So as the pandemic unfolded, there was a lot of uncertainty in the market. And so we made a conscious decision with the revenue management team, who's doing a great job, and ops to focus on occupancy to make sure that we're in a position of strength. And what was great for us is we came into the situation with high occupancy. So it put us in really good position. So what we ended up doing is this one across the market with less than 1 month's average rent concession, so about $1,500. And we did that for about 2 to 3 weeks, and then we decided to pull it back slowly market-by-market depending on what we were seeing and what our kind of demand indicators were telling us. It worked really well. You can see we are at all-time high in occupancy. Yes, it has some impact on rate, but we think that’s a good trade-off given where we are, and it's always easier to dial those concessions off. We think it's a great tool. It creates urgency for the resident, and it's easy for us to dial back. To your last question, as we got into April, we started to see demand pick up a little bit, and we then began to pull them off. So as where we sit today in May, we have no concessions going out with. So effectively, California, Seattle, Phoenix, Denver, Vegas, and even the Carolinas, we are not running concessions now. We are into that peak leasing season. We are seeing good demand there. We pulled back about a third in Florida and Atlanta and Dallas, and then we've taken two-thirds in terms of the amount in Chicago, Minneapolis and Houston. It's still early in May. We are going to watch these play out. We anticipate that we may pull them back even more, but obviously, it's helping our occupancy, and we should start to see our growth -- rate growth kind of step up from where we were in April.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jeff Spector: Good morning. Thank you. My first question is on demand. If you can talk a little bit more about the renter, where are they coming from? Any changes that you're seeing? We are getting lots of questions on folks leaving cities, looking for suburban renting homes. I guess, can you give us a little bit more color on possibly even by region?
Charles Young: Yes. So thank you for the question. Charles, again. As I said, demand has been strong, especially as we got past the initial couple of weeks of uncertainty. And so by the beginning of April, into the middle of April, we started to see demand kind of across the board step up when we looked at our number of showings and applications that were coming through. And it was really kind of across the board. Early on, as you can imagine, there were some hiccups in markets like Vegas with the casino shutting down early and some of the Florida hospitality impact. But even now, we are still seeing okay demand, and that's what we've done in terms of pulling back our concessions in those markets. That being said, it's hard to say exactly where people are coming from. That's not something that we typically gauge. But as you look at demand and as you look at our occupancy rise, I think we're really in a healthy position. I think it's a statement to single-family and the resiliency of our industry, that there's demand for our solid neighborhoods, more space that's offered by our homes, backyards, it kind of helps in the social distancing situation as well as how do we think about any of the people moving out of the cities and maybe coming into homes with their parents or with their families or co-habitating with other family members. So can't tell you specifically, but we have seen some good demand across the board, with our typical markets out west probably seeing a bit more than others.
Jeff Spector: Thanks, Charles. And my second question, just pretty amazing that May collections were stronger. Can you provide any comments on your thoughts on how that happened, or any color there?
Charles Young: Yes. Thank you. It's a good question. So look, as we think about April and how this all unfolded, it was quick. Late May -- sorry, late March, this all kind of was surprising for folks. And many of our residents were really in an uncertain position of trying to figure out what is their employment situation, what does shelter-in-place mean, where -- is there going to be any stimulus? And so what we decided to do in April was to be really flexible with our residents and meet with them one-on-one and try to understand so we could get a feel for the landscape. And it worked. We had good numbers in April. May, even stronger. And I think what we learned through April was our ability to utilize technology and upgrade a bit of our website so people could fill out a hardship form quickly and easily. We worked on our communication to our resident around what’s expected and how they can submit for a hardship. What we found in both months was that people really just needed to pay later in the month. So most of what happened in April was people wanted a chance to just pay a little later in April. And as we said in our remarks, 1.5%, 2% needed to delay a month or two. And so that's what you saw in April. As we've gotten early in May, as I said, we've understood kind of how do we continue to operate with genuine care, living up to our mission. And at the end of the day, our communication and our systems made it really streamlined, so we could do even better in May. So -- and in that, you're getting some of the collection that came through in April that's showing up in May. And I just -- I go back to the resiliency of our resident base. What you are really looking at is a household income of over $100,000, two wage earners, and it's a testament to where we think this space can go long-term.
Jeff Spector: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Good morning out there. I wanted to ask about guidance, in the sense that you look at your resilient business model, you think about the lower turnover, you think about the data that you’ve from April and May. And I recognize it's an unprecedented situation. There's a lot of uncertainty, but you have such good handle on what your revenues and expense trends are. Why not even provide just a quarterly update in terms of where you view your operating metrics from a revenue expense and NOI perspective and even drill down to an actual FFO number? Because you really have all the tools necessary to be able to do that, especially given the fact that you have such resilient cash flows, why not be one of the companies that provides that comfort to the Street about where your cash flows are likely to be?
Ernest Freedman: Hi, Michael. This is Ernie. I appreciate the question. It's a great question. And we debated it here internally, and we ran a lot of different scenarios internally with the data we have. But you sort of said it. It's an unprecedented situation. We are 6 days now into May collections, and we are really pleased with where we are at, but we are only 6 days in the May. We are only about 7 to 8 weeks into this whole process. For instance, in the month of April, we did not charge late fees. Some of that -- and quite frankly, we are not sure what we're going to do yet for May, we are keeping that open as we consider route we want to move forward. We are certainly seeing a lot of -- to be able to get then the guidance to a range that was -- as a reasonable range for something that's very wide, that wouldn't be very helpful. We think this early into this, with -- even though we are very pleased with where we are at, and for all the reasons you said, those are the reasons why we thought very deeply about whether we felt we could be comfortable put in a position to do that, there's just still too much unknown at this point. Certainly, as the year progresses, if we are in a position and we see how things have played out and with the data we’ve and we are able to reestablish guidance, we will do that as soon as we can. We just thought it was a little premature for this quarter, Michael, to do that.
Michael Bilerman: Can you talk a little bit about maybe some of the components? So what you've seen across the REIT sector is you have companies that have maintained their guidance of providing it and re-forecasting. You've seen those that have removed the actual FFO, but given the actual details of the components. And then you've had companies like yourself that have just said, we are not going to give you anything. So can you give us a little bit more sort of details around the revenue, expense and NOI, at least on the near term, because you have the data, right? So in the first quarter, you are running at 4.5% revenues, 5.3% expenses, 4% NOI. You had a range out there of 4% revenue, 3.75% expenses, 4.25% NOI for the year. At least in the second quarter, based on what you see, where should those ranges be? Is there more pressure on expenses? Are revenues trending a little bit lower than what you had seen? Just so that we at least get a current momentum on the numbers. And then is there anything else that may be impacting the P&L from a G&A perspective? All the liquidity things, Ernie, that you talked about that you’ve brought down, what sort of impact or drag could that create on a near-term basis? Just to give us a little bit more detail around the financial impact of all these.
Ernest Freedman: Yes, Michael. Let me see if I can help with -- again, reiterating that we've chosen not to give guidance. I think you are aware, we've never provided quarterly guidance in the past. But let me provide some trends that may be helpful for folks. So …
Michael Bilerman: It's an unprecedented time. So why not start now?
Ernest Freedman: So let me answer it the best way I can, because I just really don't want to do something on the fly within the call. But I certainly prepared to answer some questions about this. So in the first quarter, as we talked about, we're actually very pleased with where the results came out. From an FFO and AFFO perspective, we came in a little bit ahead of our expectations. On a revenue perspective, we came in significantly ahead of our expectations. On expenses, we came in slightly better than expectation and we know it was a larger number, but we had let folks know at the beginning of the year that we expected the beginning of the year to be a little bit harder from expense growth perspective. So that led us to a better NOI result. So all is good in the first quarter. As we think about the second quarter, there's absolutely going to be pressure, and people should not be surprised on the revenue line item. We did not budget in our original guidance that we'd be using concessions, like Charles has used here in -- as he ended March as it went in April. But importantly, he talked about that we backed off of those concessions, and maybe we will have the opportunity to back off further still. On the renewal side, we are still going out with renewal increases. But again, where our expectation would be, it will probably be a little bit less than we would have thought at the beginning of the year. So we certainly didn't expect the pandemic situation we had. So you're going to start to see the most pressure on the revenue line, and that's even before talking about where a bad debt expense may come in. We are very pleased with where collections are, because we did talk about for April, they did come in less than where they do historically. And so that's just going to take some time for it to play out and see how that happens, and again, we are only 5 days into May. On the expense side, we fully expected at the beginning of the year, expense comps to get easier as we went through the year. And if anything with expense comps, will get a little bit easier still. We don't have some of the challenges that you’ve in the other residential spaces around having density in common areas and things like that. So we think for the shorter term, we could see a little bit of easing of pressure on expenses. There may be some catch-up of expenses later in the year as we get to those deferred work orders that Charles talked about. At least for the near-term, we should have something that's a good result on the expense side. And then with core FFO and AFFO, we're actually being very careful where we spend our G&A dollars or our property management dollars. We certainly aren't traveling and doing things like that. So we are having savings there. So we would certainly hope that we would have a run rate on G&A and property management that will be favorable to what we saw in the first quarter. What I don't want is to get so specific, Michael, and then provide a specific range or dollar amounts or percentages around those things. But hopefully, that provides at least from a trending perspective where we would hope things would go here in the near-term.
Michael Bilerman: Right. And anything on the liquidity, just raising the additional capital just in terms of the drag cost on that?
Ernest Freedman: Well, you saw we’ve on our line, which we wouldn't have expected in a year of about $270 million at the interest rate that, that gets charged if we were to leave that outstanding for the full-year. That'd be a little bit more than $0.01 of drag from what we would have expected. But if things continue to progress well, we may come to the conclusion we don't need to leave the working capital cash balances as high as they are today because we did that really just to be cautious and to be careful, but things have played out very well for us to date, so we certainly have got the opportunity to do a little bit better than that.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. Thank you.
Ernest Freedman: All right. Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Our next question today will come from Hardik Goel of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Hardik Goel: Hey, guys. I just wanted to understand better how the accounting will work for, number one, the concessions, and then the delinquency reserve. So your core revenue number will net out the concessions, I’m guessing. And the delinquency will be reported as a reserve until you know what bad debt is, or can you walk me through how that will work?
Ernest Freedman: Yes, of course. So concessions aren't new for us, but we are using them more than we have in the past. So our accounting policy has been in the past is if a concession is less than $500, we will just go ahead and take that loss immediately, which we won't try to straight-line that over the period of the lease. If there's a concession greater than $500, then we do follow a gap, and we spread that over the lease. So let's say, it's $1,000 -- let's say, it's a $1,200 concession, just to make the math easy, and it's a 12-month lease, you spread that out over $100 over each month and recognize it over a period of time. So we will continue to do what we’ve been doing with concessions in the past there. With delinquency, our policy has been in the past that any amounts that are over 30 days past due, or any current amounts that are in eviction, which aren't very many, we go ahead and reserve for those 100%. Anything that's in the current bucket, 0 to 30, we've not reserved for because of a security deposit that will cover that. Early days to see what we are going to do going forward, because we’ve had payment plans in the past, but we are going to have more payment plans we've ever had before. But to Charles's point, there aren't that many. It's about 1%, 1.5% of our residents who've asked for some help. And so we may get to the situation with some of those payment plans, and if we’ve confidence, we won't reserve for the balance if it's greater than 30 days. We haven't made that determination yet. The good news is it's not a very big number at this point. So we will continue to recognize rental income is based on the lease. And we are seeing that we're getting the cash collections that will certainly justify that. We will make the determination of how we want to deal with a deferred payment plan as we get further into the second quarter and see how many we have and what our history has been then during the second quarter on people making good on their promises to pay when they will. So for the most part, it's a cash collection because we've been very successful, but there may be a buildup of receivables throughout the year if payment plans continue to trend in that small range that we've had so far.
Hardik Goel: Thanks. And just real quick on the R&M and turn, I know there's somewhat of a comp issue, but the expenses are up roughly 18% to 20%. And I'm wondering you're deferring some of the stuff -- you said you're deferring noncritical stuff. What would have they been up if you were not deferring anything and it was a normalized environment?
Ernest Freedman: Yes. It's interesting. So we -- because it's all happened so late in March, the answer is very, very small. These items that we are deferring today are typically done by our service techs. And so our service techs have lost some productivity on the side of going out and doing work orders, but we've actually redeployed them to do other things: keeping houses spot clean for self-showings, helping out with turns, things that they have done a little bit in the past, but doing a lot more now because they are generally focus on service. And so, really, the only cost that we're not absorbing right now, that we would have had in the first quarter for those last couple of weeks, what about any supplies that they would've to purchase to do their routine work orders. And those dollars are much smaller. Much higher dollar spend are on the more significant work orders that have to get done, that are sometimes done by our guys and sometimes done by vendors. So you wouldn't have seen much of a difference in our first quarter results regardless of what's happened with the pandemic.
Hardik Goel: Thank you. And just lastly, if you will indulge me. What is the -- if you had to take out all your swaps today, what would that cost you guys if you have to settle them all?
Ernest Freedman: Yes. And that will be disclosed today in our -- when we release our 10-Q a little bit later today. It's a little bit over -- the mark-to-market on the swaps today is a little bit over $600 million. It was in the $350 million range at year-end with interest rates going down. The duration got shorter, so that helped a little bit on the mark, but interest rates went down more significantly. Good news is there's no cash collateral required on that, something we need to do. But yes, the mark-to-market has certainly gotten larger with the lower interest rates.
Hardik Goel: Got it. Thanks, Ernie.
Ernest Freedman: Yes.
Operator: Our next question today will come from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Please go ahead.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks very much. It's good to hear from you guys. And hope you're all doing well. I wanted to ask about tenant demographics. Is there any color on employment industry profile that you could provide as well as perhaps some read on unemployment rate across the tenant base?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Jade, this is Dallas. In terms of the demographics and what they do, we obviously do income verification on the way in. I think the headline there is really that their monthly rent to income ratios right now are at 5x. In some markets, we are even seeing a stronger strength than 5x, but the average is 5x. But it's all walks of life in terms of where they come from. As I mentioned in my previous quarter remarks, first responders, teachers, health professionals, etcetera, kind of run the gamut. And so you will see that vary by kind of cohort and submarket, but it's not something that we track independently.
Jade Rahmani: Okay. And I suppose there is a risk of unemployment insurance not being renewed at the end of July. Do you’ve any idea how much that stimulus is helping with respect to current rents? And a related question is, do you know what percentage of April and May rents were paid out of security deposits?
Ernest Freedman: Well, I will answer the second part of that question.
Dallas Tanner: Yes, go ahead.
Ernest Freedman: None were paid out on security deposits at all. That has not been an issue for us. And I will let you talk about the first one, Dallas.
Dallas Tanner: Yes. I mean, anecdotally, there is -- we haven't heard a whole lot about stimulus checks or things like that coming in and being a part. Little bit in May, with some people that have requested late pay cycles, but -- I mean, those numbers are pretty few and far between at this point, Jade.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks. I do appreciate the conservatism around the decision to not provide guidance. I think that's the right decision. Thanks for taking the questions.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Jade.
Operator: Our next question today will come from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. Wonder if I could just follow-up on Michael's questioning. Completely recognize that you're not wanting to give guidance. You did give a lot of transparency on some moving parts thus far in April and early May. So I just wanted to make sure I was sort of thinking about the methodology correctly. So look, there's three things that I'm focused on. Number one, what you collected in April and what you collected in May thus far; your lease on -- lease renewal rates, including rent concessions and your occupancy increase. So if I’m thinking about this correctly, let's assume you never get back April and you collect 100% of May and June. I think that's around 2% headwind. Then let's assume you get the 3.2% increase on 30% of your portfolio, that’s about a 1% tailwind. And then you get the occupancy increase. Doesn't that push you for same-store revenue in the flattish range for 1Q? And I guess that's a very long way of saying, what am I missing in those and sort of those moving parts?
Ernest Freedman: Rich, that’s a lot of math to do on the fly here in the middle of …
Rich Hill: I had 45 minutes. I had 45 minutes to do it. So …
Ernest Freedman: Yes. That may be right, but I certainly want to think about that after the call and take a look. But you're looking at the right components in terms of what could happen. I guess the big question is, and we're excited that we're at 100% collections for May as we stand today. That's based on historical average of where we are typically on a day 5. Rent collections come in throughout the entire month like you see with the other residential companies, too. And again, being that we're only 2 months into this, again, we feel really good about the business. I don't want any mixed messages about that. But June is still unpredictable. And so we want -- and so you could certainly set up a set of assumptions like you did, run the math and get to the answer. We're just -- we think it's -- if we were to give guidance, we would do a pretty wide set of what those assumptions would be so we -- because we want to hit it. We want to give you numbers, and we actually want to beat it. That's what you try to do typically. But yes, I think everyone -- you can see -- you got -- everyone should do kind of what you are doing and think about those reasonable things and we will have better data 3 months from now on how we've done 4 months into the pandemic versus 7 or 8 weeks into it, and may have more confidence at that point to be able to provide a better guide for a quarter or for the rest of the year.
Rich Hill: Got it. Helpful, Ernie. And sorry to put you on the spot, but I had to ask the question. One follow-up to that. It seems like you have a pretty good handle on the COVID-19 implications to earnings, at least near-term. But have you given any thought to what this recession means medium to long-term? I recognize that there might be more demand as people move to greater spaces and single-family rental benefits from that. But have you given any thought to what this means longer term? And I guess I'm asking that because we just don't have a lot of history as a public company. I recognize Dallas has a fair amount of history owning homes through a recession, but how are you thinking about the recessionary impacts post COVID-19?
Dallas Tanner: Well, I think -- Rich, this is Dallas. I think it's a thoughtful question. As you think about -- there's really kind of two parts to think about in unpacking that and answering it the right way. One is, based on what's going to happen in housing development and new units coming online, say, over the next year or two, if we were to go into a recessionary period for some while, we are still going to have the fundamental lack of supply to meet normal household formation and all the demand factors that we are seeing in that cohort of what our current resident is, age 39. There is 65 million people between the ages of 20, 35 coming our way. So that does not -- that actually makes that demand, I think, greater from that perspective. What you will typically see, and what we saw in the last recession in our private portfolios was that occupancy stayed really healthy. You did see people kind of collapse. You see some kids living with parents a little bit longer and some of that stuff. And you'll see modest rate growth with some market differentiation depending on what’s going on. I think the good news for our business, our portfolio and our asset quality and resident quality is that we've insulated ourselves to some of the risks that may be more prevalent in Midwest and parts of markets where you might see less growth or less demand. I really like our chances and our ability to lease having a much more infill portfolio with a higher, call it, gross economic rent band, higher rent-to-income ratio resident that's a bit more qualified, to be able to meet that occupancy. I think the way you will see additional pressure put on leasing, and it will be interesting to see how this plays out with homebuilders and deliveries and things like that, is that you're ultimately going to have pretty healthy demand for our product, if it's located close to job centers, major transportation corridors, and ultimately, three to four bedrooms that can allow a family to fit comfortably. I think that's the key. So I would have bet in this next kind of cycle, outside of not knowing what the future may hold 3, 6 and 9 months, we like our position going in.
Rich Hill: Got it. Thank you, guys. Congrats on a really good quarter.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Rich.
Ernest Freedman: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Our next question today will come from Jason Green of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Jason Green: Good morning. Just on the limited uptake regarding the payment plans. I guess, what do you think is driving that given, in other REIT sectors, we've seen some opportunistic tenants seeking relief. Is that underlying strength from the tenants, or is it more a reflection of your willingness to work with these tenants should they experience some distress?
Charles Young: Yes. This is Charles. I think it's a little bit of both. And just to be clear, we're also working within any kind of local rules and jurisdictions. California, Washington, they have specific rules that we're making sure we follow. But in April, our ability to work with them one-on-one and understand their circumstance, talk with them. And the reality is most of them just wanted some time to figure this thing out and see what it meant, and we gave them that flexibility. Those who had really lost their job or impacted health wise, those are the ones that ended up going on payment plans. And to be clear, it's a small part of our portfolio. So I think it's a little bit of both. And in May, I think it became clear kind of what's going on, and stimulus was in place. You could see the future begin to open up state by state and people feel a bit more comfortable, and they weren't asking for as much as they were when they were really uncertain in April.
Jason Green: Got it. And then just on the home purchase side, we've seen a pretty public battle between the mortgage servicers and the GSEs. I guess in the marketplace today, do you see a greatly diminished ability for homebuyers to obtain financing to buy homes?
Dallas Tanner: Well, I can tell you this, we’ve seen the statistics be a little bit more towards people moving out for home purchasing. And it's clearly a friendly rate environment. So if somebody's got the down payment ability, they're in a strong position, but we're not seeing any trends in our own portfolio that suggest big wholesale shifts.
Jason Green: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hello out there. I hope you guys -- can you hear me? Hello?
Ernest Freedman: Hey, Haendel. We can hear you.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey. Great, thanks. So thanks for all the color. Wanted to go back to expenses for a second, just get a bit more color. You talked earlier about some of the near-term pressures and uncertainties. I was hoping you could talk a bit more about maybe some of the potential positive offsets, some of the things that you're seeing within the portfolio, maybe lower maintenance, less unit turns, maybe less leasing personnel? And how meaningful could those be in helping to offset some of the pressures you noted earlier?
Ernest Freedman: Yes. Absolutely, Haendel. Our business is -- fortunately, it was able to shift pretty quickly and pretty easily to the new environment just because of the way we do things all the time. So there won't be a radical change in our expenses because of that. But I think there are some opportunity areas for us. If you think about on the fixed expense side, from the last time we spoke with you guys, we actually had a very favorable insurance renewal that we didn't anticipate when we spoke in the last quarter. And insurance costs are going to be closer to flat year-over-year for the remainder of the year versus where we thought they'd be up high single digits. So that's a good guide that's out there that will certainly help us out. On that -- and then on the property tax side, we're just going to have to see what happens, Haendel. I do think there will be pressure for local jurisdictions not to push real estate taxes as hard on local residents, and we are a local owner as well. So I know jurisdictions are probably going to be a little bit cash-strapped. At the same time, people aren't going to be able to afford higher real estate taxes because of what's going on with the pandemic, so that could potentially help us on the property tax side. On the controllable expense side, you sort of said it, Haendel. The biggest one is probably going to be turnover. We did see a material decline in turnover in April. We are seeing retention rates going higher. They are trending that way also in May. So we will see how that plays out at the end of the day. I know you are seeing that in the other residential sectors as well. And turnover is one of our biggest expenses. So not only do you get the benefit of higher occupancy, you get the benefit of, typically, when there's not a turn -- a higher rate in terms of where you bring the new lease to the next lease, because we are still having rent increases on the renewal side, but you save on the expense on the turnover side. So that's probably the biggest one. Anything with R&M would probably just be more of a shift in timing. We will probably have a little bit less R&M cost over the next period of time from what I talked about in one of the earlier responses. But that's going to catch up. We are going to get to those deferred work orders. And we may actually have a little pressure on us from an expense perspective that, to get through them more quickly, we may choose to outsource a few more of those than we might in the past just to get through them more quickly, but we haven't made that determination yet. But overall, that probably puts us in an expense environment similar to what we thought at the beginning of the year, or maybe slightly better, but we will just have to see how things play out over the next many months.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks, Ernie. So maybe a bit of a follow-up on that, the retention point you made. It looks like the first quarter was unchanged versus the fourth, but you mentioned that retention has picked up here in April into May. How is that in relation to the 70% retention look like you've had over the last few quarters? And how high do you think that can go? Certainly, we expect residents to stay longer, but just curious on maybe some thoughts on while there's 75%, maybe 80% of the new normal in this post-COVID paradigm?
Charles Young: Hey, Haendel. It's Charles. Thanks for the question. Yes, year-over-year, we were flat Q1, but still very good. That's less than 30% on a trailing 12. In April, we came down turnover from 2.5% to 2.2%. So we will take that. Like you said, we're solving for occupancy right now. In this uncertain period, that feels like the right answer. So we may give up a little bit of renewal growth, but we are still getting some. They're trending down a bit. Where those numbers go, we will see. You would expect that low-70s, mid-70s is where we are going to operate in the -- as a goal in the short-term here. But we are really staying nimble and looking at it month-by-month to make sure that we are making good decisions. And as we think about -- when we put our guidance, we will have some more months under our belt. It's still uncertain times, and we think people are going to come our way, but we want to prove that up.
Haendel St. Juste: That's helpful, Charles. If I could squeeze in one more, Dallas, forgive me. But just curious on your cost of capital and capital deployment thoughts, understanding you guys are putting a pause, and rightfully so. You guys have a bit more higher leverage, market uncertainty, discounted stock price here. But you more than have that discount on the stock side in the past few weeks alone, though you're still trading at a discount here, this consensus spot NAV. So curious on your thoughts how you or the Board might be thinking about potentially issuing equity at a modest discount to NAV to fund what could appear to be a compelling investment opportunity? Is that something you are open to? And how do you as a team and a Board think about that trade-off? Thanks.
Ernest Freedman: Haendel, this is Ernie. And I apologize, we are -- we are running long here. We got another call bumping up against us, and we’ve other people who want to ask questions. So we are going to be smart capital allocators going forward. And it's not going to be any different than we’ve done in the past with regards to how we think about things. If tools are available to us, we will use them. But we're going to be very focused on remaining liquid and being smart about our capital allocation.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question today will come from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Hey, thanks very much. I will be -- try to be very quickly brief here. Charles, were there any markets in April that actually saw higher turnover?
Charles Young: Let me see if I can give that for you. We really didn't see -- I think there was maybe -- you are saying April or are you asking for Q1, to be clear?
John Pawlowski: April.
Charles Young: April. Yes, we were pretty much on target and flat relative to prior. Chicago, North Cal and in the West Coast, low as usual. Maybe a little higher in the Florida markets, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa, but that's really about it. And it wasn't -- it was really just marginal. We are still seeing really good trends when it comes to turnover. Thank you.
John Pawlowski: All right. Thanks. I will concede the floor. Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, John.
Operator: And our next question will come from Doug Harter of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harter: Thanks. Ernie, can you just talk about -- in the first quarter, what -- how large were late payments that you received and what that impact could be if you continue to waive them?
Ernest Freedman: Sure. Yes. So we typically get between about -- about $1 million, $1.25 million of late fees per month. So for the quarter, it would have been about $3.5 million, maybe about $4 million. As I mentioned, in the month of April, we did not charge late fees. We will see what we are going to do in May and June. Certainly, in some jurisdictions, we are going to follow local rules, and we won't be able to do that, which is appropriate. And so that could -- for us, late fees over the year are about 1% of our revenue, so little bit less. And so we will just have to see how that plays out through the remainder of the next few months.
Douglas Harter: And just along that, are there any other kind of ancillary fees or other kind of add-on fees that you're kind of not looking to collect at this point, or is everything else sort of collecting per usual?
Ernest Freedman: Everything else should be billing and collecting as usual. The things where we see some of our largest ancillary items are utility reimbursements, and so we are certainly still billing for those. We are seeing -- in any of our other typical fees around applications and things like that, pet rents and all those types of items, those are still being processed and being paid by our residents.
Douglas Harter: Great. Thank you, Ernie.
Ernest Freedman: You bet.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you again for joining us today, everybody. We wish you all the best. Please stay safe. Operator, this will conclude our call.
Operator: Thank you. And we thank everyone for attending today’s presentation, and you may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-19 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Invitation Homes Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Greg Van Winkle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greg Van Winkle: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. On today's call from Invitation Homes are Dallas Tanner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer. I'd like to point everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings press release and supplemental information which we may reference on today's call. This document can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. I'd also like to inform you that certain statements made during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other nonhistorical statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. During this call we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. To find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and supplemental information which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dallas Tanner.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you, Greg. 2019 was a great year for Invitation Homes marked by a 9% increase in AFFO and same-store NOI growth of 5.6%. I'm excited about our momentum heading into 2020. But before I turn to our plans for the new year, let me begin by reviewing some of our 2019 accomplishments. In the first half of the year, we completed the integration of our Starwood Waypoint merger exceeding our synergy expectations. This work equipped our unified team with an enhanced operating platform that has provided capacity for future growth and scale and enabled us to take our quality of resident service to new heights. We are proud that the service we delivered in 2019 helped drive resident turnover to a record low of 30%. Alongside our unified platform, we also made further ProCare enhancements which together helped drive a 3% year-over-year reduction in controllable costs in 2019. While improving our cost profile, we also remain successful in leveraging our revenue management tools and local field expertise to capture favorable supply and demand fundamentals in our top-line performance. For the full year 2019, this translated to a same-store revenue growth of 4.5%. With respect to acquisitions and dispositions, we far exceeded our initial capital recycling goals for the year accelerating portfolio activity that should drive better long-term growth and risk-adjusted returns. In total, we sold $900 million of homes that no longer fit our long-term strategy and use proceeds to buy approximately $650 million of homes with higher expected total returns and to repay debt. While this acceleration of capital recycling resulted in some short-term earnings dilution, we expect it to be accretive to earnings over the long term. Our capital recycling in 2019 also included successful bulk transactions. In the first half of the year, we acquired a portfolio of 463 homes in infill submarkets of Atlanta and Las Vegas for $115 million creating incremental value by leveraging our scale and platform. In December we completed a $210 million bulk sale in our smallest market Nashville. We made a strategic decision to exit Nashville as the size of our portfolio there did not allow for the same-scale efficiencies we are able to achieve in our other 16 markets where we average approximately 5,000 homes per market. By leveraging strong investor demand for single-family rentals in Nashville, we were able to opportunistically sell 90% of that portfolio in one efficient transaction. Finally we had another successful year in capital markets. We opened a new financing channel by closing our first ever loan from a life insurance company, using proceeds to repay higher cost debt. We also reduced our net debt by over $700 million in 2019 bringing net debt-to-EBITDA from 9 times at the beginning of the year to 8 times at the end of the year. As proud as I am of our team for what we accomplished together in 2019, I am even more excited as I look ahead. Several months ago we explained at our Investor Day why we feel ready to run. Industry growth fundamentals are favorable. We have a strategically located high-quality portfolio and scale that enhanced growth opportunities. We have a refined platform that is positioned better than ever to optimize execution. We have an innovative team that is committed to the resident experience. And we have a clear set of goals to run toward to drive both organic and external growth. We are no longer just ready to run. We are now running and expect to make significant progress toward many goals in 2020 which I'd like to address in more detail. First same-store growth. In 2020, we expect to grow same-store NOI by 4.25% at the midpoint of our guidance. This expectation is supported by strong market fundamentals. Across our unique footprint, household formation rates have been running at over twice the U.S. average and many of these households have demonstrated a preference to lease. Invitation Homes makes the opportunity to lease even more attractive by curating a leasing lifestyle that includes 24/7 professional service convenient features like Smart Home technology and family-friendly spaces and locations where residents want to live. Furthermore, we believe our business has built-in cyclical hedges. And regardless of what happens in the broader economy, demographics should become more of a tailwind as the leading edge of the millennial cohort approaches Invitation Homes' average resident age of 40 years. Beyond capturing positive fundamentals, we will focus on enhancing same-store growth through reduction in days resident and further improving our ProCare service efficiencies. In addition we will move the ball forward on several ancillary service initiatives. While the dollar impact of these initiatives on ancillary income in 2020 will likely be small, we are laying the foundation from more significant ancillary income growth in future years and continue to expect an incremental $15 million to $30 million of run rate NOI from ancillary services by 2022. Moving on from internal initiatives, another 2020 priority is accretive external growth. Today we are seeing many opportunities to buy homes to enhance growth in earnings and NAV per share. In many cases, these opportunities are presenting themselves in markets where we own less than 4,000 homes today which can benefit more significantly from economies of scale as homes are added. For example, Seattle, Denver, Las Vegas and Dallas. We also see attractive opportunities in markets of greater scale like Phoenix, Orlando and Atlanta. Should the opportunity persist as expected in 2020 to buy homes accretively relative to our cost of capital, we plan to be a net acquirer of homes. Also on the external growth front, we will seek to expand our value-enhancing CapEx program whereby we invest in upgrades to existing homes to enhance resident loyalty, improve asset durability and increase risk-adjusted returns. I couldn't be more excited to kick off the new year and tackle these 2020 initiatives with our best-in-class portfolio platform and team. We are grateful for your support as we continue running toward another year of outstanding service for our residents and value creation for our shareholders. With that I'll turn it over to Charles Young, our Chief Operating Officer to provide more detail on our fourth quarter operating results.
Charles Young: Thank you, Dallas. We finished 2019 strong. We were pleased with our financial performance as both same-store revenue growth and NOI growth came in at the high end of their respective guidance ranges. More importantly, I'm proud of the strides we continue to make with our resident service evidenced by our resident survey scores in the fourth quarter that reached new heights. I'll now walk you through our fourth quarter operating results in more detail. Same-store NOI growth of 3.8% in the fourth quarter brought our full year 2019 same-store NOI growth to 5.6%. Same-store core revenues in the fourth quarter grew 4.3% year-over-year. This increase was driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 4% and a 10.8% increase in other property income net of resident recoveries. Average occupancy was 96% for the quarter consistent with prior year. This brought our same-store revenue growth of 4.5% for the full year 2019. Same-store core expenses in the fourth quarter overall were in line with our expectations growing 5.3% year-over-year. Primary drivers of the increase were property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. Year-over-year increases in R&M OpEx were partially offset by decreases in R&M CapEx. Turnover spend increased more moderately than R&M spend. Before moving on from expenses, I'd like to take a moment to expand on the drivers of the 3.3% decrease in full year controllable expenses that Dallas mentioned in his opening remarks. Efficiency initiatives beginning in the summer of 2018 prompted a quick and sustainable turnaround on repair and maintenance efficiency that helped limit the increase and cost to maintain to only 1% in 2019. This performance and cost to maintain was better than our expectation coming into the year. In addition platform refinements helped to drive a 9% reduction in personnel costs in 2019. Finally record low turnover rates coupled with process improvements drove turnover cost down 9% and leasing and marketing costs down 6%. Next, I'll cover leasing trends in the fourth quarter of 2019 and January 2020. Our revenue management and field teams worked well together in positioning our portfolio for the seasonally slower months of leasing. In the fourth quarter and January we prioritized maintaining higher occupancy to ensure favorable positioning heading into the upcoming peak leasing season. Blended rent growth was 3.4% for the fourth quarter where the renewals coming in at 4.5% and new leases at 1.6%. In January which is seasonally slower for leasing blended rent growth was 3% with renewals of 4.5% and new leases of 0.3%. Occupancy increased throughout the fourth quarter in January with January averaging 96.5%. This is 20 basis points higher than last year's January occupancy and should position us well for when peak leasing season kicks off in the spring. With fundamental tailwinds at our back we are confident as we start 2020. Our operating teams are focused not only on executing to capture positive fundamentals but also on operating more efficiently to drive down days to re-resident and offset cost inflation. I'm excited to go after these opportunities in 2020 with the best-in-class team of local partners in the field and central support and our corporate offices. With that I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer Ernie Freedman.
Ernest Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today I will cover the following topics: one balance sheet and capital markets activity; two financial results for the fourth quarter; and three 2020 guidance. First, I'll cover balance sheet and capital markets activity. We continue to make meaningful progress in reducing our overall quantum of debt and improving our leverage metrics as we strive to become an investment-grade company. In 2019 we reduced our overall net debt by over $700 million reduced net debt-to-EBITDA to 8x down a full turn from where we started the year. This deleveraging was accelerated in the fourth quarter through capital markets activity tied to our investment efforts. First, we used proceeds from our Nashville bulk sale as well as other cash on hand to repay almost $200 million of secured debt in the quarter. These payments also benefited our weighted average interest rate as we directed voluntary prepayments toward higher cost debt. Second, we raised $38 million via our ATM program during the quarter to over-equitize acquisitions. In 2020 we will continue to focus on both leverage reduction and external growth balancing the two opportunistically. I'll now cover our fourth quarter 2019 financial results. Our FFO and AFFO per share for the fourth quarter increased 6.1% and 10.8% year-over-year to $0.32 and $0.28 respectively. This was primarily driven by higher same-store NOI lower adjusted G&A and property management expense and lower cash interest expense. Partially offsetting the increases in core FFO and AFFO were lower non-same-store NOI resulting from disposition activity including our Nashville bulk sale and higher share count due to ATM issuance. The last thing I will cover is 2020 guidance. As Dallas and Charles discussed we believe we have strong fundamental tailwinds at our back. We expect to grow same-store core revenue 3.75% to 4.25%. We expect same-store core expense growth in the range of 3.25% to 4.25%. We expect to sustain the efficiency gains we achieved in 2019. As a result controllable expenses net of recoveries which are comprised of expenses such as personnel costs and the OpEx portion of cost to maintain are anticipated to grow at an inflationary rate of approximately 3% at the midpoint of our guidance. Fixed expenses which represent about 60% of our total core expenses are expected to grow at a higher rate than controllable expenses. Anticipating a larger increase in our property insurance expense as our last property insurance renewal was in 2015. With respect to real estate taxes we expect our growth rate to moderate from 2019 levels with an anticipated increase in the 4s. This brings our expectation for same-store NOI growth to 3.75% to 4.75%. From a timing perspective we expect same-store NOI growth to be higher in the second half of the year than in the first half. Year-over-year revenue growth comps are more challenging in the first half of 2020 and we also expect year-over-year expense growth rates to moderate over the course of 2020. Full year 2020 core FFO per share is expected to be in the range of $1.27 to $1.35 and AFFO per share is expected to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.12. Included in this guidance is an assumption that we will be a net acquirer of homes in 2020. We will take an opportunistic approach with acquisition volume ultimately dictated by how attractive the buying opportunity is relative to our cost of capital as the year progresses. Most recently we have been buying at a pace of approximately $200 million per quarter. We have multiple tools available with which to fund acquisitions and would expect a portion to be funded with proceeds from the sale of lower-tier homes albeit at a more moderate disposition pace than in 2019. A detailed bridge of 2019 core FFO per share to the midpoint of 2020 guidance can be found in our earnings release. As a result of our anticipated growth in AFFO per share in 2020 we have increased our quarterly dividend by 15.4% to $0.15 per share. We continue to target a low dividend payout ratio as we prioritize deleveraging and accretive external growth. I'll wrap up by reiterating that we are excited to run towards the 2020 priorities that Dallas discussed in his opening remarks. The client demand fundamentals are in our favor and we're in position to capitalize on these fundamentals with the strategic locations and scale we've assembled within our portfolio. We are prepared to execute efficiently with our refined platform and our entire team is focused on widening our lead by pursuing strategic initiatives to drive both organic and external growth. With that operator would you please open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Ernie maybe just starting on guidance. In the fourth quarter you did $0.32 of core FFO which annualized gets you to $1.28 so above the low end. And I recognize there's transaction activity and some refinancing or paying down debt. But just wondering if you can walk through the right run rate to start and any adjustments to the fourth quarter number that gets you to the 2020 guidance?
Ernest Freedman: Yes. And I'll take it more at a high level approach in it with regards to for the full year and then we can try to tie it back to the fourth quarter. So for the full year we laid out in the supplemental growing from where we ended 2020 at $1.25 and walking to the midpoint of our guidance range which is $1.31. First off, the expected NOI growth rate of 4.25 at our midpoint of guidance adds $0.08. We have a couple of things that are acting as headwinds for us as we go from 2019 to 2021 as we thought it was a wise decision in terms of exiting the Nashville market. But that was dilutive to us with regards to the NOI contribution that we gave up compared to the use of proceeds which I think was a good use of proceeds for us to delever the balance sheet further. But that's going to cost us about $0.01. And certainly in the fourth quarter of 2020 - 2019 excuse me, we basically had a full contribution from the Nashville portfolio as we sold that in the middle of December. So there's certainly a little bit of noise from that. Secondly, when you look at one of the items, we pointed out in that walk was the fact that financing costs are going to be a $0.03 drag I addressed. About half of that comes from just what we have in place today in terms of our forward step-up swaps. Those were put in place a few years ago by the company we merged with, with regards to similar when Invitation Homes it was still fixing our long-term cost and these four step-up swaps which we've disclosed in our 10-Qs and our 10-Ks over the last many years. A number of swaps expired during 2020 just like they did in 2019. And the replacement swap - was in place for the last few years is at a higher rate. And so, that's going to cost us about $0.015 in terms of our dilution that's kind of spread out through the entire year. So again a little that, that impacts back to fourth quarter number and that number that you pointed out as well, when you factor that in and then our expectations around being a net acquirer this year which we hope to do. That also - that's the other part of the $0.03 I talked about there. Those are kind of the big drivers that take us from $1.25 to $1.31. If we didn't have that dilution if we didn't have a little bit of noise from the cost of funds you would have seen an FFO growth rate that would have be closer to the higher single-digits versus what we were projecting again at the midpoint of our guidance that's closer to 5%.
Nick Joseph: And then maybe just on the net acquirer comment can you quantify that what guidance assumes for acquisitions and dispositions in 2020?
Ernest Freedman: Yes sure, so we were expecting to do - and we hope to do is to be able to acquire a similar pace that we finished out the second half of 2019. And that pace was anywhere between high $100 million almost $200 million up to about $225 million, $250 million. So we're hopeful that we'll be able to continue at a pace similar to that in 2020. And typically what you've seen in our years on the acquisition front that ramps up throughout the year. The first quarter typically is a little bit lighter. You see us ramp up in the second quarter, we usually see some great opportunities in the third quarter as peak buying season by end users winds down there's opportunities for us to jump in. And then it kind of slows down again in the fourth quarter. So it wouldn't be ratable across the year. So, we'll see if we can maintain that pace. It all depends on what the market conditions are and where our cost of capital is at that time. On the dispo front - that you'll see a drop-off in the amount of dispositions we've done relative to what you saw in 2019. The guidance certainly doesn't consider any bulk sales or any market exits like you saw in Nashville. And the guidance assumes that we're going to have a disposition is more in the range of probably $250 million to $400 million of dispositions. A little more front-weighted on that one than notch, but generally spread out across the year but maybe a little more front-weighted as you think about where the $250 million to $400 million proceeds may come in.
Operator: The next question comes from Shirley Wu with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shirley Wu: So my first question has to do with your 2020 guidance. So you do assume of around 50 bps acceleration at the midpoint on revenues. So I'm just curious as the building blocks of that and what you're seeing in terms of demand from a consumer?
Ernest Freedman: Sure yes sure. Let me talk about the guidance and I can let Charles weigh in about what we're seeing currently from a demand from the consumer. In 2019, our revenue growth came in at a high-end of the guidance. And I'm pleased with where that came in at 4.5%. At the midpoint of our guidance as you pointed out for 2020, we're assuming 4%. Not just similar to what we did last year. Last year our midpoint of guidance I think was 4.1% and we ended at 4.5%. So we're certainly hopeful of it its similar track record in 2020 compared to 2019, but we'll just have to see how it plays out. But embedded in that assumption at the midpoint of guidance of 4% we're assuming occupancy stays relatively flat compared to the prior year. We're assuming that other income improves a little bit relative to the other year in terms of the other income growth rate and likely at a rate that's slightly higher than our overall revenue growth so higher than 4%. But offsetting that as we are expecting that from a rate perspective that will decelerate a little bit from what you saw in 2019. We had a similar thought as we enter 2019 and it turned out we were able to do a little bit better and that's what got us to where we did with a 4.5% growth rate. Just as you think about the numbers on a year-over-year basis last year Shirley and to get to a 4.5% in 2019 numbers. We had 50 basis point increase in occupancy. As I mentioned we think that's going to be more flattish this year. So you take that out you're kind of comparing the 4 to 4. We hope to do a little bit better maybe a little bit better on occupancy maybe a little bit better on rate that's built into our numbers. We certainly see the opportunity for that, but we want to make sure we came out with reasonable expectations to start the year. Charles, do you want to talk about what we're seeing demand lies right now?
Charles Young: Yes high level, hey Shirley. Overall fundamentals are strong. Supply demand remains a significant tailwind as we look across the markets. As I said in my opening comments, we took the fourth quarter to make sure we're focused on occupancy. And in January we're in good shape. We're year-over-year above where we were last year trying to hold that occupancy in Q1 so we can go in the peak season to capture that strong demand that we're still seeing out there.
Shirley Wu: So my next question has to do with the recent announcements whether that's the Johnson eliminating niche, or the merger with FrontYard. I was curious as to your thoughts on what that means for the industry and just overall thoughts on a major platform?
Dallas Tanner: Shirley this is Dallas. I'm happy to talk high level from an industry perspective. I prefer not to get into specifics about any competitors on this call. From an industry perspective though as you look at the consolidation that you see happening whether it's with the recently announced [indiscernible] transaction or some of the smaller things that we see in the marketplace that happened it’s all good generally speaking for the industry. We would expect that this industry over time and some distance will have many operators with considerable scale. We look at it as a good thing for the space in terms of ancillary companies’ other opportunities things that will develop around the industry. As well as the ability to offer quality experience for residents which will only help the industry mature over time. So, we view all of these kind of moments of consolidation as a real opportunity for the companies that are involved in the industry as a whole.
Operator: Next question comes from Drew Babin with Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: Building on Shirley's question it looks like one of the leasing spreads for 2019 overall were about 4.6%. And you mentioned so far in January occupancies trending ahead year-over-year. I guess kind of putting it all together you'd have to be assuming a pretty significant deceleration in the leasing pace early in the year at least to hit the very low end of guidance? And so I guess - filtering that down is there anything that you're actually seeing on the ground anywhere that would point to this deceleration in blending leasing spreads? Or is it just - a product of it being early in the year and kind of just waiting to see how things come together as peak leasing season approaches?
Ernest Freedman: Yes Drew, I think it's definitely much, much more the latter. Yes remember this guidance when we provide a range. And you're right to point out when you factor in and understand that. A lot of our revenue is sort of baked in already based on the leases we signed in 2019 it would take a significant deceleration for us to get the low end. And we certainly hope just not see that. I'll also caution that both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 are light leasing months for us. The brunt of the year in terms of - we need to achieve for 2020. Leasing activity will occur in the second quarter and the third quarter as it does across all the residential space. So I'm always cautious not to draw too much to get too excited - its December or January early your numbers are great and also not get too worried if they're not where you might want to be because you're not doing a whole lot of leasing activity at that time of the year. We want to provide a range for guidance as to what are our possibilities but it certainly, we feel good where we're starting the year we feel where things are at. And we certainly see a path that could play out similar what we saw in 2019 that we're able to later in the year as peak season did well in 2019 if we had that opportunity in 2020 to increase guidance as we go.
Drew Babin: And on the expense side you talked about real estate tax growth kind of moderating to somewhere in the 4s which is obviously good news. And I know there's a lot of work that goes into the thousands of appeals that you need to do. I guess how much wood is there left to chop as far as appeals that will impact this year both the assessments and millage rates, legislation and tax is changing with municipal revenue guidelines? And then I guess is there anything on the variable expense side R&M or anything like that where you could see maybe a little bit of extra benefit as the year goes on but I like the revenue guide it might just be a little too early to predict?
Ernest Freedman: Yes on the real estate tax you said it right Drew there's always a lot of wood to chop when it comes to appeals. And our guidance does not assume a whole lot of success and appeal. So if we have - continued to have better and better years and we had a pretty good year in 2019. There's an opportunity to potentially perform to the upside there. We do expect some success. But again it's moderate levels. But in states like Texas its normal course to appeal basically everything. We still have a number of outstanding appeals in Georgia that we got our fingers crossed on. And hopefully we have some good news on it and of course if you go across different jurisdictions. You see different opportunities in Florida is always a big one for us. One of the nice things we're seeing is again with our exposure to California and the fact that real estate taxes are locked in at a 2% growth rate there because of Prop 13 that certainly helps over time moderate our real estate tax exposure. And so again we're confident that we're going to do something in the 4s as we discussed in the prepared remarks. And again, we'll see opportunities potentially to do a little bit better than that. Across the broader expense environment you're also right Drew and that it's early days. January was a good month for us. January came in - meeting our expectations with regard to expenses in doing slightly better than what we might have expected on the revenue side but not enough to get too excited about. But also, it's one month and we'll see how the year plays out with regards to how things go there. We certainly built in some level of contingency in our expense numbers. In some years you need it. In some years you don't. And unfortunately some years you might not have built in enough and we do our best to try to factor that into our guidance. And similarly last year we had a big outperformance in expenses as the year went through and we'll hope to do the same this year but it's too early to give with any confidence where that may hit.
Operator: The next question comes from Jason Green with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Jason Green: On the rental rate growth side I understand these numbers can bounce around but just curious what you're seeing given both new and renewal leases showed a slight deceleration in the quarter year-over-year. Is that kind of product mix? Or is there less room today to push rate?
Charles Young: Jason this is Charles. Thanks for the question. As I said fundamentals are strong in the markets. And we're seeing it on the ground supply and demand still a tailwind. When you step back and you look 2019 in aggregate, we had a great year on occupancy and rate growth both were up year-over-year. And we had our best peak leasing season ever. In retrospect it's as we look back though it's clear that we may have held the new lease rate maybe a little too long into the season. And it started to slow down our leasing velocity in Q4. And as we talked about Q4 Q1 are slowing leasing seasons and we wanted to focus on occupancy. And so what you're seeing across the markets. In some of the markets we had to push a little bit down on rates to get back to occupancy and we got to 96 in Q4. And in January we're running north of 96 which is great. We're above where we were last year and we're keeping that momentum going in. So the whole idea here is to set ourselves up for peak leasing season where all the action happens Q1 Q4 things are a little slower. We want to capture the peak leasing season to make sure that we can have our best foot forward.
Jason Green: Got it. And then I know you guys had talked about hoping to do call it $200 million per quarter in acquisitions. But in today's market with today's pricing are you able to quantify the total dollar amount of potential acquisitions you see in the marketplace today that makes sense from a pricing perspective?
Dallas Tanner: Well I mean and again this is Dallas. Good question. I think as we look think about growth and we think about acquisitions. And we said this Ernie mentioned this in his earliest comment in the Q&A. We feel that that $200 million per quarter run rate's pretty achievable in today's environment given where the supply and demand kind of meet each other in the markets that we're really focused in. If we saw more opportunity we would certainly try to lean in and find a bit more external growth while we weigh out everything including what our cost of capital at that point is. It's hard to quantify everything that you're missing on top of what you're acquiring. But at the end of the day we feel pretty good about those estimates that somewhere between $175 million and $250 million a quarter feels pretty doable in today's environment and we'd certainly look for more opportunity to come in front of us.
Operator: The next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Hardik Goel: I guess just to round out sources and uses of the capital. Can you give us an update on where you expect leverage to be at the end of the year?
Ernest Freedman: Yes absolutely. And a lot will depend on our capital activity that we do with regards to acquisitions and dispositions. But we expect that we'll continue to be able to bring our improved our net debt-to-EBITDA numbers. And based on kind of where our guidance is and where we see EBITDA coming in and our plans around capital allocation, I would expect net debt to EBIT to be somewhere between 7x and 7.5x by the end of the year.
Operator: The next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley.
Ronald Kamdem: Ronald Kamdem on for Richard. Just a couple of quick ones from me. The first is just on going back to sort of the market exit. Any other markets that could potentially we could see down the road as an exit opportunity? And if not, what are the markets that are going to be mostly targeted for dispositions that we should be thinking about?
Dallas Tanner: Yes in terms of how we look at the portfolio as a whole from an asset management perspective we're always going to be measuring ourselves against performance and some of the other macro factors that we see in markets. So as Ernie mentioned in his guidance comments at the beginning for the year we're not pricing in any bulk sales or market exits in any of our plans for 2020. I think that our selling will center around traditionally what we've always looked at which are nonperformers geographic outliers’ parts of the portfolio that aren't just making a ton of sense for us over the long term. And as we weigh that out in terms of our global view of where we can find the best risk-adjusted returns that's where we're typically selling on the margin. And you see that we're a little bit more active in the middle part of the year as we're turning more properties and having the ability to look and review some of the assets that are on our questionable lists and things that we're thinking about. But I wouldn't expect anything outside the norm from a market mix perspective than what we've done in the past.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And just a quick follow-up. Going back to the control of expense question just digging in a little bit. I think about the 3% growth that you're targeting is it fair to think about maybe R&M growing above that and some of the other line items maybe growing below that and getting us to that average? Or are they sort of all uniformly distribute it? Any other color there would be helpful.
Ernest Freedman: Yes. So when we talk about R&M I brought it on and just talk about the overall cost to maintain. It is the OpEx side of it. It's the CapEx side of it as well. This year interest we do expect both OpEx and capital scope in similar amounts. And we think all that line item is being right around that same inflationary increase.
Operator: The next question comes from Jade Rahmani with KBW.
Jade Rahmani: With about 50% of revenue coming from California and Florida I wanted to ask about how an issue like climate change into your thinking and considerations thinking about the current asset base as well as when you're making new investments? And just in terms of a practical import, when do you think an issue like climate change would start to affect insurance costs and other operating factors? How far ahead are you looking at this issue?
Dallas Tanner: Thanks Jay. I'll take the first question. I'll let Ernie talk about the insurance question your second comment question. In terms of how we think about climate change and you referenced California and Florida. Obviously both very warm weather markets for us high growth lots of things going on in those markets. We're focused on a couple here. So first of all as you start to look at the portfolio as a whole and which assets you want to own and why for the launch you want to be sensitive around things like flood plain and things where you could have potential exposure which also doves in your pricing on your insurance question which Ernie can comment on. And then we're also doing some things. We've actually got we're doing some what I call early work to try to get smart around what opportunities are available to us around things that fall into the ESG buckets such as solar and things like that. Now are those sustainable strategies for us for the long haul. We're not in a position today where we feel that we've got that completely figured out but it's certainly something we're focused on. We want to be an environmentally-friendly company. There's things we do already whether it's around hard scape landscaping and things like that. That can add to that narrative. And that mission which is part of being active in our community. But there's still a lot of room to grow and things are changing consistently. So I think making sure that from a risk profile we're being smart around which assets where and why. And then also from a service perspective what are the things that we can do to enhance that experience and also be environmentally-friendly along the way are all focused for us right now.
Ernest Freedman: On the expense side it's certainly something we're very cognizant and even the investment side as we think about risk-adjusted returns across our entire portfolio. We're very focused on thinking about putting the correct premiums that would be required because of that. From a California perspective Jay the risk for us from a climate perspective would be around wildfires. And we've been very specific about where we're investing in California and had been very fortunate to date based on where we are where our geographies are the wildfires the power outages are impacting California really haven't impacted us. So when you take that to an insurance perspective really the risk, we're insuring for in California is quake which is a separate risk from climate change. In Florida we've been very specific to make sure where we're investing in Florida that we're not exposed exactly to the coast or very careful on flood plains. And what insurers like about our risk compared to other residential is that our risk is spread out across thousands of assets across many, many miles. We don't have a $100 million single asset in one location that could be impacted very significantly by something that happening from a storm perspective. So it's a little bit more dispersion of risk. But clearly anyone who's exposure to Florida and we have exposure to Florida has seen pressure on cost when it comes to insurance but we have some good mitigants offsetting that they probably put us in a little bit better position relative to other residential and commercial real estate because of the nature of our asset type.
Jade Rahmani: Just turning to the investment outlook and acquisitions. How far are you looking out in terms of cap rates? Because it can make a big difference based on your growth assumptions. For example buying at a 5% cap might seem attractive but if the market is only growing at a 2% same-store organic rent growth rate that gets to about 5.5% five years out. But buying at a 4.5% cap with the market growing 5% 6% similar to where say Phoenix and Vegas are growing gets to 6% or higher five years out. So how far are you underwriting in terms of your investment criteria?
Dallas Tanner: It's a great question Jamie. And you're spot on. And going in cap rate doesn't tell you the whole story on any acquisition. So we would agree. And remember we're total return investors. So to really emphasize the point you made we look at obviously ingoing yields and what the cash flow's going to look like but we really care about what's going to happen around the asset over the long haul. And so our models are typically anywhere between three and five years as we look at markets. And there's a couple of ways we do it looking at kind of different return profiles. But we completely agree. And we care as much about what our year three NOI yield is going to look like as much as we do our year one and coupling that with where we think we're going to see that outperformance and growth. And if you look at where we have been active specifically in 2019, I mean you'll notice that the majority of the 2000-plus acquisitions we made last year were on the West Coast. And that's indicative of the type of growth we're seeing. It's evidenced in the renewal rates the new lease growth that Charles has talked about. I mean you see markets like Phoenix for example in the fourth quarter and we had blended lease rates of 7% and which are really, really strong. And it really emphasizes the types of growth you're seeing in those parts of the market. So we would agree it's all relative. It's all important as it goes into our models and how we think about growth. And as we mentioned earlier in the call and in my opening remarks we are as focused on trying to grow accretively through external measures in markets where we already have significant scale like Phoenix and Orlando those are great markets for us going forward.
Operator: Next question comes from Douglas Harter with Crédit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is actually [Sam Chau] on for Doug today. Just going back to Jay's question about climate. I mean we've had a milder winter this year compared to the historical average. So when we're thinking about maintenance strategy how does weather impact when to make the CapEx spending to kind of maintain the rental portfolio?
Charles Young: Yes. I mean we have a couple of cold weather markets in Denver and Chicago. We've been operating there for a while and we're always conscious of how we treat the homes especially when they're vacant to make sure that we're being conscious of any freezing pipes and stuff like that. And our smart home technology helps us with that and being highly occupied is another benefit. So we try to pay attention to that. The reality is it has been a little more mild but there's seasonality that comes with it. Our experience and talent on the ground that's why we're local. We have eyes on assets that gives us a good comfort that we're making sure we're maintaining the homes that are vacant and occupied by our residents.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. On a similar note I mean you guys talked about the lowering of days to re-resident how smart home other tech kind of impact that. Just curious how that has changed compared to on last year and how we should expect that going forward?
Charles Young: Yes. Well the last couple of years we really haven't moved down this metric as much as we want. We're in the mid-40s right now. And our goal this year is a real focus is to try to take two or three days all that in 2020. As you mentioned there's a lot that goes into it looking at turn times utilizing technology to try to lease better and faster and just having an overall focus is the real cross-functional metric that we're looking at. So there's no reason long-term that we'd like to get that number down into the re. We have several markets that are there right now. And so we're going to continue to push. There's real benefit in getting that economic occupancy down.
Operator: The next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Stride Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Charles curious for your thoughts on a few of your Florida markets which saw outsized revenue deceleration take South Florida for instance which comps weren't all that difficult and you still saw outsized pressure on the new leases. So on the demand side what are you seeing in terms of employment shifts? And then or is it more of a supply issue with single-family construction starting to add pricing power?
Charles Young: Yes good question on South Florida. It's really more of a supply issue and it's not necessarily the new single-family supply specifically but there's a lot of condo vacancy a lot of options for the consumer to choose from. And given that and it's really happening in certain submarkets where we're seeing the supply impact. And our field teams and asset management teams have done a really good job of selectively pruning out of those submarkets. So we'll think we'll be in good shape long term. But because of that we've been focused on occupancy. If you look at - look back over the year we actually went up in occupancy to 95.4 versus 95.2 in 2018. And we'll take that same approach in 2020. With a little bit of supply out there you may see some pressure on rates but we've been able to maintain occupancy and we'll focus there until we can start to get some pricing power.
John Pawlowski: I guess how much overlap between your tenant base and a condo occupier? Is there is - I wouldn't assume there's a ripple effect in terms of your tenant base maybe a bit lower credit quality versus a mom and pop that would occupy a condo?
Charles Young: Yes there typically is not. South Florida is a very unique market. And I think it really comes down to just having lots of options for the consumer in a market like that. Our rents are a little higher in South Florida. Condos are out there. If people are trying to move them it just gives options. So it's - to your point it's not typical but in that market it's kind of unique and it's showing up.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And then last one for me Ernie or Charles hoping you could humor a hypothetical. I'm trying to disentangle in terms of the next few years the natural aging of homes and the impact on the total cost to maintain versus pretty robust above inflation growth we're seeing on the labor side and the material side. So if labor costs and material costs literally printed 0% growth over the next few years what's a reasonable cadence of total cost to maintain we should expect as your homes just naturally age?
Ernest Freedman: Yes John I don't want to speak off the top of my head and give you an answer. Let me to think through that a little bit because it is hard to disentangle those types of things. We also take - have the impact the fact that we're pivoting to external growth which means we'll be bringing more homes on that will get that initial upfront renovation relative to what we've seen in the last few years. So unfortunately, it's not an answer I can give you spot on as I was sitting here but let's give us some thought and get back to you.
Operator: Next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you, operator. That was spot on.
Ernest Freedman: Is that the first time Haendel?
Haendel St. Juste: Probably. A question I guess going back to external growth for a second. I guess I want to get more of a sense of the competitive dynamic you're seeing out there. By our account there's at least three large private platforms looking to grow with one public peer. So I guess I want to get at how large or how attractive are the opportunities today versus say a year or two ago that meet your quality and market requirement? And more importantly are you seeing more competition for the deals you're looking at?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, it's a great question. So I think your first question encompasses really just demand right? Like what's the demand feel like out there. And I'd say if you look at any of the new homebuilder data if you look at any of the resale data it all kind of point to the same direction in the first quarter this year which is resale supply is really tight. Consumers are buying homes leasing homes really quickly in the market. We just generally talk about the supply is underserved. And so we would see that the same way. Now to your specific question around what do we see specifically in our space with our competitors. I think we got to be honest with ourselves and taking a step back and just remind ourselves there's no more than probably 400000 homes that are professionally managed in the U.S. today which would represent less than 2% of the overall single-family rental detached population. So even amongst our peers whether they're public or private we represent a very small cohort of the people that are actively out acquiring single-family homes either for ownership or for rental. So we play in the same sandbox so to speak with the end users with other consumers new capital coming into the space what have you. And so as I look at it this market has been really tight for the past three or four years. There hasn't been a ton of new supply. And then you go back to what I think is a differentiator for our business which is we generally earn a much tighter location band than most of our peers that we pay attention to in the single-family rental space. And that's indicative of where our rent values are today. I think we're approaching almost 18 50. And if you look at the price points of our homes whether it be what we're buying or selling generally a much higher price point which means much closer in and which lends itself to some of those overwhelming demand kind of factors that come into play. So the demand side of it and that feels really active. There's not a bunch of homes sitting on market and a company like Invitation Homes can just go in. But when you're local when you're looking at everything all the time when you're active in the space both on the buy and the sell side it lends itself to opportunities. We talked about that in our opening remarks. We had an excellent bulk transaction in the first quarter on the buy side. We had a really efficient sale on the book side in Q4. So I would expect us to keep kind of running the same offense that we are which is being opportunistic not compromising location and I would expect that we can put up that $200 million per quarter number hopefully unless we see something different.
Haendel St. Juste: Great. And I guess a follow-up. Given those comments especially the low new supply dynamic. I'm wondering if there's been any rethink on your view on perhaps building out a development platform now that you're especially ready to run and grow?
Dallas Tanner: No not really. In terms of taking on balance sheet risk and being a builder that's not something we're focused on today. I think being the best buyer of single-family homes in the country that's what we are focused on today. So if that's buying from a builder or buying from boutique builders and markets, we'll look at that. But we don't want to compromise my earlier point on location for the sake of growth. It's just it's a dump. If you buy further out if you're willing to chase what are - what I would call paper yields you can get yourself in trouble. If you are diligent and disciplined around sticking to what you know how to do which for our business has been paying up the curve and buying assets that are better located, they're going to have some of those demand factors we talked about we believe that's a winning formula for us going forward.
Haendel St. Juste: One more if I could. A question on Dallas the market. Occupancy there is just about looks like 89% well below your portfolio average and down like over 300 basis points year-over-year. Curious if that's some type of temporary dip perhaps seeing some supplier move out to the home buying there. So curious what's going on your Dallas portfolio. And then more broadly as we step back and think about where you can deploy redeploy some of your national capital. How high in your list are Dallas in Houston today? In both markets where you have under 5000 homes and what are the current yields or IRR is broadly speaking in those markets today?
Dallas Tanner: That's like three or four questions in. Charles?
Charles Young: I'll take the first part then I'm going to turn it over to Dallas to talk about the redeployment. As I hear your question, I think you may be looking at the total portfolio versus same-store portfolio to get the occupancy. Focusing on same-store for Dallas and looking at the year-over-year we actually had a really good year. Occupancy is up to 95.5 again below kind of our average but it was up from 94.3 the year before. So we made nice progress so good strides there. We made some more changes in late 2018 and performance has responded well based on that. And we were actually up on rate year-over-year in Dallas as well. So, I think as those markets continue to grow, we got a great team on the ground right now. We're going to add more assets to it. We get some even larger scale. We'll continue to focus on occupancy and continue to grow the rate over time. I'll turn it over to Dallas do you want to talk about the redeployment of Nashville?
Dallas Tanner: Yes sure. So Haendel, we've been pretty clear about this probably in the last year and a half. We really want to grow in markets like Dallas and Denver and you'll see that in our 2019 numbers for Dallas I think we bought 175 homes and we only sold I think less than 40. So we grew by 130 assets. So that market itself we've put a lot of thought into specifically where we want to grow what types of submarkets making sure that we're staffed up the right way. We've actually kind of built out both of those teams both Dallas and Denver in the last year. So really good about where we are heading into 2020. And I would expect that your total portfolio vacancy will be a little bit lower as we're on-boarding those new units over the next couple of years.
Operator: The next question comes from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Ryan Gilbert: Had a question on turnover and Charles you said that you might have held rate just a little bit longer than you had might - have liked in the second half of this year. And I'm wondering if that contributed to the tick up in turnover that we saw in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis? Or if there's been an increase in move-outs to home purchase or anything else that might have driven the turnover rate higher?
Charles Young: Yes great, great question. So taking your last part first, we haven't seen any uptick in move-out around purchase. It's been pretty flat throughout the year. And in regards to turnover look the number is still really low and it tick0ed up a little bit but 30% is a number we like. And a lot of that is a testament to our teams and what they're able to do and the customer service that we're providing. It's hard to say where they're holding that rate was really an uptick. That's really on the new lease side - so those homes are already turned over. And they stayed a little vacant longer than we wanted and that's why we had to give up on rate a bit. So I don't think that contributed to it or maybe had a mild contribution. But overall, we're still really pleased with where we are in our trailing 12 turnover rate 30% is really strong.
Ryan Gilbert: And then just two quick ones. What do you think you can - earn from an operating cash flow perspective in 2020?
Charles Young: I’ll make sure I understand the question what will we earn from an operating cash flow?
Ryan Gilbert: Sorry earn is not right word. What do you think your operating cash flow will be in 2020? It looks like it’s around $700 million in 2019?
Ernest Freedman: So well I just want to think about how you're defining operating cash flow with regards are you looking at core FFO or are you looking at AFFO after - recurring CapEx?
Ryan Gilbert: Just cash flow from operations on your cash flow statement?
Ernest Freedman: Ryan, we’ll get back to you on that after the call. So I don't want to answer it incorrectly with this many people on the line.
Ryan Gilbert: And then just how have initial NOI yields trended on acquisitions?
Dallas Tanner: Well ingoing cap rates for us for the most part have been kind of in the mid-5s in terms of what we're seeing. Is that am I answering your question right?
Ryan Gilbert: Yes. No real change in acquisition cap rates then?
Dallas Tanner: On today's environment no.
Operator: The next question comes from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Buck Horne: Not quite but well close enough, Appreciate you guys. Now that we're in an election year I did want to circle back on the rent control topic and thoughts about just your California homes and given that there's just more rumblings for possibilities of enhanced rent control measures out there that could affect single-family rentals whether they're owned by corporations or others? How do you balance that into your equation of capital allocation and your thoughts about California investments going forward?
Dallas Tanner: Yes you stay active on it is the short answer. You make sure that you're part of the discussion that you're involved. We work with a number of different organizations specifically in California to keep a surprise of anything that's going on. And on top of that we participate at the state level with the governor's office and the housing authorities that are involved with the state of California. We have - Buck we have actually in our 2020 guidance baked in that we think will be active in terms of making sure that we're getting the right messaging out and being focused on no on Prop 10 what they call Prop 10 2.0. Now I think it's a little disappointing because I think the Governor and the House and the Senate done a nice job in trying to create some alignment around the rent cap measure that went in place last year. We are also very realistic in our understanding that every two years or so this is going to be an election type of topic. And so we've got to stay active on it. We believe that Costa-Hawkins will or what they're calling Prop 10 2.0 will have the similar effect that it did two years ago which was resoundingly defeated I think by a measure of 2 to 1. We believe that it's not good for the state of California to limit new development in rooftop formation and things that the state quite frankly needs. My understanding is that the Governor's on board with that approach and that that is generally widely seen as one that will pass. In terms of being focused on other markets as well where some of those conversations coming up, we're very active through the NHRC through some of the other efforts that we participate in to make sure that we're in the early stages involved with any discussions that are going on around rent control or anything like it. Fortunately it doesn't feel like as of yet in any of our other markets that there's anything of real substance moving through any floors whether it be at the state level or local levels. And so California is always a little trickier. It's one of the benefits of our portfolio as Ernie mentioned before it's a great market with high demand but you get to inherit some of the fun governmental type of stuff that can come up as being an active owner of real estate in those markets. And you got to participate in the process. So for us we'll continue to stay active. We believe that we're in a good position and we'll continue to support causes to get the meshing out.
Buck Horne: Awesome, thank you. And my last quick one is going back to your comments about how many smaller private whether they're mom-and-pop investors out there that are buying up homes and the amount of capital that's getting invested in the single-family rental. Those percentages seem to have increased and that's one of the reasons resell inventory seems to be so tight. So how do you think about that going into leasing season? Do you think that the increased investor activity creates a near-term supply headwind as they're trying to get those homes turned and leased? Or does it - really just is it a function of that the overall housing market is just still supply-demand imbalance in your favor? How do you think about that going in leasing season?
Dallas Tanner: Your last comment spot on overall the housing supply imbalance is definitely in the favor of anyone in the single-family business whether you have home available for sale or homes available for lease. We don't see that changing. And I think it is important to remember the differentiation and I'll let Charles speak this as well. But the macros on our industry whether we come into a market with 150 new homes in a given year or don't doesn't really change the macros particularly of that market. In terms of how much overall product could be available for lease. To your point, we may have a little bit better visibility in what some of our maybe bigger institutional peers are doing because of their marketing and things like that. But I'll let Charles speak to that.
Charles Young: Yes macro - Dallas is spot on. I think we will see in certain markets where there's a real focus on great fundamental markets like Orlando where the competitors came in and bought up some product and put it on the market all at once that you may have a short-term blip. We saw that in Orlando in Q4. It's starting to moderate as you work through the product. And if you look at our numbers our results in occupancy have rebounded immediately. So, if there is it's kind of a short-term thing and then we get back to the fundamentals of the market that play out. And that - most of all of our markets are in our favor.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: We'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Invitation Homes and the team looks forward to seeing many of you in March. Operator with that we'll conclude our call.
Operator: This conference has now concluded. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Invitation Homes Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in listen-only mode at this time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Greg Van Winkle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greg Van Winkle: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. On today’s call from Invitation Homes are Dallas Tanner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer. I’d like to point everyone to our third quarter 2019 earnings press release and supplemental information, which we may reference on today’s call. This document can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, at www.invh.com. I’d also like to inform you that certain statements made during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. During this call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with the most comparable GAAP measures, in our earnings release and supplemental information, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dallas Tanner.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you, Greg. The third quarter was another solid quarter for Invitation Homes. We feel great about the position we are in to finish 2019 strong. As we shared at our recent Investor Day in New York, we are ready to run as we look toward the future. In my comments, I’ll start by discussing the drivers of our continued outsized organic growth. I’ll then transition to external growth. Finally, I want to reinforce why we feel ready to run and what that means. Organic growth remains strong and in line with our expectations in the third quarter, as we continue to execute well to capture favorable fundamentals in our markets. On the revenue side, we again saw year-over-year acceleration in both rental rate growth and occupancy. And on the cost side, we drove another year-over-year decline in controllable expenses. The market fundamentals underpinning these results remain terrific. Across Invitation Homes’ unique market footprint, focused in the Western U.S. and Florida, household formations in 2019 are running at over 2 times the U.S. average. Demand is exceeding supply and Invitation Homes is helping to solve the imbalance by providing high-quality well-located homes with professional service to families that want to enjoy a leasing lifestyle. Put simply, the growth drivers in our specific markets and submarkets give us an advantage. But fundamentals are only the start. It takes great execution to produce results. And we have positioned our teams for success with industry-leading scale and a high-touch service model that combine best-in-class technology with local presence. This translates to differentiated resident experience that is driving strong financial performance. To that end, given our consistent execution in 2019, we are increasing our full year 2019 Same Store NOI growth to 5.2% to 5.6% or 15 basis points above our previous guidance at the midpoint. Ernie will elaborate on our updated guidance later in the call. Next, I’ll provide an update on our external growth. As 2019 has progressed, we’ve seen more opportunity for accretive acquisitions and have reacted opportunistically to increase our pace of one-off buying. In the third quarter, we purchased 578 homes for $183 million, almost entirely in single asset acquisition sourced by leveraging our in-market investment directors and our proprietary technologies. By comparison, this is more than double our pace of single asset acquisitions in the first half of 2019. Buying in the third quarter was focused primarily in the Western U.S., Dallas and select markets of the Southeastern Florida. We continue to see an attractive opportunity in these markets to buy well below replacement cost and generate attractive returns relative to our cost of capital. We also continue to capitalize on our opportunity to enhance our portfolio through the sale of lower quality and less well-located homes. In the third quarter, we sold 668 homes for gross proceeds of $168 million. This brings our year-to-date acquisition and disposition volume to $456 million and $527 million respectively, sourced via our channel agnostic approach. I now like to spend time looking ahead. Those of you who attended or tuned into our Investor Day earlier this month heard us talk about being ready to run. That’s not just a fun tag line. Ready to run is an ethos our whole team is embracing that will help guide the next several years at Invitation Homes. Every good runner knows that their best performances come when conditions on the track are favorable and that they have a clear strategy for how they want to run a race. They’ve done the work in advance to prepare themselves and they have the right team around them to support. And specifically, they’ve set goals of which they are trying to achieve. For Invitation Homes, being ready to run means something similar. First, our industry is in the early stages of a long-term growth story with favorable fundamental tailwinds at our back. Second, we have a strategically located portfolio and scale that create [a mote] [ph] and enhance growth opportunities. Third, we have a refined integrated platform positioned better than ever to optimize our performance. And fourth, we have an innovative team that is committed to the resident experience, running toward common goals that should drive both organic and external growth. Let me touch on those organic and external opportunities in more detail. Earlier on the call, I discussed the fundamentals driving our organic growth. Looking ahead, we are even more encouraged. We believe our business has built-in cyclical hedges and regardless of the direction of the macro economy from here, the millennial generation is coming our way. Over 65 million people or roughly 1/5th of the U.S. population is aged 20 to 34 years. And we believe many in this cohort will choose the single-family leasing lifestyle as they form families and age towards Invitation Homes’ average resident age of 39 years. With our strategically located portfolio, best-in-class platform and industry-leading scale with over 4,700 homes per market, we believe we are ideally positioned to benefit from these demographics. Beyond capturing positive fundamentals, there are number of things we are doing to augment organic growth by enhancing the resident experience and improving efficiency. To name a few, we are continuing to refine our already best-in-class systems and processes for engaging with residents and carrying out our ProCare service commitments. We are expanding ancillary services, which we believe, we’ll bring an incremental $15 million to $30 million of incremental run rate NOI into the business over the next few years. And we are pursuing initiatives to lease faster, which we believe will reduce days of a [resident] [ph] and add another $10 million to $20 million of run rate NOI. In addition to organic growth, we’re also running toward accretive external growth by being disciplined about opportunistically buying in the right places and at the right times, we can enhance growth in earnings and NAV per share. At the same time, our asset management team can help us achieve a higher quality portfolio by proactively identifying and selling homes that no longer fit our long-term goals. And by investing value enhancing CapEx in homes to enhance risk-adjusted return, asset durability, and resident loyalty. With all these internal and external opportunities to create value for both residents and shareholders, it’s a great time to be Invitation Homes. From top to bottom, I couldn’t imagine a better team to partner with to run this race, and we are grateful for your support. With that, I’ll now turn it over to Charles Young, our Chief Operating Officer to provide more detail on our third quarter operating results.
Charles Young: Thank you, Dallas. We delivered another quarter of resident service, we showed up not only in our resident satisfaction scores, but also in our P&L. During the third quarter, which is a busy period for leasing, turns and maintenance, the quality of our service translated to yet another record low in resident turnover. For the first time, turnover fell below 30% on a trailing 12-month basis. We also continue to set new heights in our resident satisfaction survey scores. I’m proud of my partners in the field, I want to thank them for their daily commitment to generate care for our residents. I’ll now walk you through our third quarter operating results in more detail. Favorable fundamentals and strong execution led to Same Store NOI growth of 4.5% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2019, in line with our expectations. Same Store Core revenues in the third quarter grew 4.4% year-over-year. This increase was driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 4% and a 40 basis point increase in average occupancy to 95.9% for the quarter. Same Store Core expenses in the third quarter increased 4.3% year-over-year, continued platform refinement and efficiency gains resulted in a 0.4% decrease in controllable costs, net of resident recoveries. Offsetting the improvement and controllable costs was 8% increase in fixed expenses, net of resident recoveries driven primarily by higher property taxes. Let me add some color to the improvement we have made this year in controllable expenses. Platform refinements has driven a year-to-date reduction in personnel, leasing, and marketing costs of almost 10%. This improvement has been in line with our expectations. Cost to maintain has been 0.4% lower year-over-year to date even better than our expectations. Process improvements beginning in the summer of 2018 drove a quick and sustainable turnaround in repairs and maintenance efficiency that resulted in a roughly 3% decrease in cost to maintain in the first half of 2019. This was followed by a more inflationary increase in cost to maintain in the third quarter of 2019, as prior year comps become – became less of a tailwind as expected. In the fourth quarter, prior year comp should again be less beneficial. To be clear though, we continue to see further upside to cost efficiency over the next several years as continue ProCare refinement may help offset some general inflation in cost to maintain. As a reminder, ProCare is our unique proactive way we serve our residents for move-in to move-out, including post move-in orientations proactive service trips and pre-move-out visits. Next, I’ll cover leasing trends in the third quarter, demand in our markets remain favorable through the end of peak leasing season, resulting in a 40 basis point year-over-year increase in average occupancy to 95.9%. At the same time, that blended rent growth increased 30 basis points year-over-year to 4.6%. Renewal rent growth was 4.7% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 4.8% in the third quarter of 2018. And new lease rent growth was 4.3% in the third quarter of 2019, up from 3.4% in the third quarter of 2018. Importantly, our teams also did an excellent job managing leasing activity in the later stages of peak season to ensure that we carried high occupancy into the off season. This has positioned us to finish 2019 strong and will remain focused in the last couple of months of the year to deliver the leasing lifestyle that our residents expect. With that, I’ll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Ernie Freedman.
Ernest Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today, I’ll cover the following topics, balance sheet and capital markets activity, financial results for the third quarter and updated 2019 guidance. First, I’ll cover capital markets activity, where we completed a number of steps in the quarter to continue delevering our balance sheet. In July, we completed settling conversions of our 2019 convertible notes with common shares. Also in July, we voluntarily prepaid $50 million of higher price secured debt that carried in interest rate of LIBOR plus 231 basis points. In September, we issued $19 million of equity through our newly implemented at the market program, and an average price of $28.02 per share. Proceeds were used primarily to fund acquisitions. After the impact of this capital markets activity in the third quarter of 2019, net debt-to-EBITDA declined to 8.5 times, down from 9 times at the end of 2018. Moving forward, we will continue to focus on deleveraging alongside our external growth objectives as we pursue an investment-grade rating. Our liquidity at quarter end was approximately $1.1 billion through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facility. Moving on to our third quarter 2019 financial results. Core FFO was $0.29 per share and AFFO was $0.23 per share. Third quarter Core FFO and AFFO each came in about $0.01 sort of our expectations, largely due to a timing shift whereby $3.5 million of expenses were accrued in the other net line of our P&L, because this was a timing issue, the $3.5 million bad guy in the third quarter of 2019 will be offset by $3.5 million good guy over the next 2 quarters. In addition, we have increased our pace of capital recycling, as Dallas discussed earlier on the call. Our disposition volume has totaled $527 million to the first 3 quarters of 2019 above the high-end of our initial $300 million to $500 million expectation, while this accelerates improvement in portfolio of quality and enhances our ability to drive long-term growth, margin expansion and risk adjusted returns, it resulted in a slight short-term earnings dilution in the third quarter as we cycled out of cash flowing assets and into a new assets. The last thing I will cover in our update is 2019 guidance. Given our year to date results, we are tightening and increasing our full year 2019 Same Store NOI growth guidance to 5.2% to 5.6% versus 5% to 5.5% previously. This is driven by Same Store Core revenue growth expectations of 4.25% to 4.5%, up from 4% to 4.5% previously and Same Store Core expense growth expectations of 2.25% to 2.75%, tightened from 2% to 3% previously. We’re also tightening our full year 2019 Core FFO per share guidance to $1.24 to $1.28 versus $1.23 to $1.29 previously, and our 2019 AFFO per share guidance to $1.02 to $1.06 versus $1.01 to $1.07 previously. I’ll wrap up by reiterating our new mantra, we are ready to run. Our portfolio is strategically positioned for growth. Our people are best in class and the operational refinements we have made in 2019 and primed our platform for efficient execution. Fundamentals remain compelling and we are poised to create value to our organic growth, external growth, better leasing efficiency, ancillary services active asset management and value enhancing CapEx. With that operator, would you please open up the line for questions?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today’s first question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate the color on the external growth and maybe the shift to being larger grower going forward. Will that accomplished by accelerating the amount of acquisitions that you’ve been doing or slowing the dispositions, if you could just talk about the cadence of both of those going forward.
Dallas Tanner: Sure, Nick. Thanks for the question. As we set out for the year and we start to see it really early in the second quarter, we thought we’d be a little bit more to net neutral on the year as a whole. But we definitely started to signal this summer that we’re seeing some opportunities in markets. I would expect that we maintain a nose towards being a bit more acquisition focused as we see some of these good opportunities. We’re in a unique environment where we can incrementally add to the portfolio and continue to sell the non-performers along the way. And so, as Ernie mentioned in his comments earlier, we definitely had a little bit more disposition activity throughout the year, but we’ve been equally benefitting by the current condition of the market and seeing additional opportunities for growth.
Nick Joseph: Thanks and then just in terms of funding you start using the ATM program. How do you think about use going forward in terms of potentially overequitizing deals to help lower leverage?
Ernest Freedman: Yeah, Nick. This is Ernie. That’s certainly an opportunity for us to consider and we have considered that. And we’ll just continue to look forward as our most efficient use of capital or cost of capital I should say for us to fund acquisitions as we [prefer] [ph] to be more of a net acquirer and because we are trying to get to an investment grade balance sheet and bring leverage down that you point out a very good opportunity for us to potentially to get there a little faster by over exercising.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Hey, guys. Ernie, I’d start with you. I’m trying to square away the 3Q 2019 expenses versus maybe what’s guide implied for 4Q 2019. Thinking back to our discussion in 2Q 2019 earnings, where you had mentioned that 4Q was going to be, I think an easy comp. So help me understand maybe how property taxes are going to go down, but your guide implied is still for a rise in expenses. I’m just trying to square that a little bit.
Ernest Freedman: Yeah, sure, Rich. In talking – all throughout the year we have talked about real estate taxes, specifically on that line that 4Q quarter would be our easiest comp and still projecting to be that way. Year to date we’re at about 6% expense growth, in real estate taxes I think it’s 5.9%. And we’ve provided guidance on real estate taxes all year, that we thought would be somewhere in the 5%. And we feel very comfortable with that. So that does imply, and we do expect that fourth quarter real estate tax growth will be less than we’ve seen year to date. For other expenses then, we just want to make sure – we’ve been cautious all year. We want to make sure we build an appropriate amount of conservatism with our expense guidance. We had the opportunity in the first two calls of this year to be able to bring it in this quarter. It was closer to our expectations with regards to expenses on our overall basis. So I know that implied math there show that there would be an acceleration of expenses. But take that acceleration with what our performance is for the year and how we’ve provided guidance. And we feel good that we’ll – come out with a number that’s within our range. And hopefully, beat those expectations like we’ve been able to do most quarters this year.
Rich Hill: Got it. That’s very clear, Ernie. Hey, Dallas, I want to go back to you for a second and think about how you’re sort of buying and selling homes right now. Could you maybe talk through the backdrop for single-family rentals and where you’re most bullish on the sectors versus maybe some markets where you’re less bullish? And are there any new markets that at least considering – we keep hearing about Boise, Idaho, for instance? So I’m curious just how you’re thinking about that for maximizing your revenue.
Ernest Freedman: Yeah, absolutely. So for a little bit color on what we’ve been selling, it’s been a unique year, in that we’ve sold more end-user type of homes back into the market. I think we’re close to almost 2,000 homes through the end of Q3, roughly 1,900 homes and some change. That we’ve actually put back into the end-user market, those would be much lower cap-rates, typically homes that would price much better at a retail level. In terms of what we’re buying and where we’re seeing some of the best opportunity, and a lot of this goes to my earlier comments around scale and being able to drive some of those great efficiencies and margins on a market, we’re seeing excellent growth in markets like Phoenix and Seattle right now, where we can go and buy meaningfully attractive cap rates and operate those homes at margins that are continuing to optimize. Furthermore, we’re seeing a tremendous amount of demand in Phoenix for most of the year and our new lease rate growth has been north of 10% for the year. And that continues to just provide us confidence that that’s a market we want to continue to invest in. And in terms of some of the smaller markets like Boise, they’re certainly attractive. There are operators that are going in there. But I think I’d just take a step back and say where is our best use of capital right now. And I think it’s in these parts of the country where we already have significant scale, we have the ability to provide more scale into that particular market, which will then enhance greater efficiencies on the margin. And taking a step back, we’re still seeing exceptional growth in these markets like Phoenix and Seattle. And some limited parts of the southeast as well. But definitely have a strategic advantage with our footprint in the West.
Rich Hill: Yeah, and so just one follow up question to that and I promise I’ll be quiet. Are you doing something different in Seattle, because it seems like a real significant competitive advantage to me relative to your peers? And your commentary about still buying homes in Seattle resonates. So what do you – Seattle is growing like a weed. What are you doing differently there that allows you to still buy homes and maybe your competitors out there?
Ernest Freedman: Well, I think one of the advantages, we highlighted this a bit at our Investor Day is we’ve been local from day one. So our investment team on the ground in Seattle supported by the back office in Dallas has been working together now for the better part of seven years. So we’re local, we’re high touch. We’ve had the ability to do some unique kind of off-market opportunities with some local builders here and there in the past couple of years. And on top of that, you just have to be active there every day. It is not really anything different than we do in every market, Rich, except that we were in Seattle early and built enough scale to where you could run a business quite frankly the right way. And so, our team that is leading our efforts in Seattle is just doing a fantastic job. I think a little bit of a cooling in the broader housing market has helped us a little bit with some more opportunity there. But it’s still exceptionally tight, but the fact that we’re there every day allows us to see some opportunity.
Rich Hill: Yeah. That’s great. Thank you. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Shirley Wu of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shirley Wu: Hey, good morning, guys. So as you guys become more acquisitive, how do you balance that with your balance sheet? So your pursuit at the leveraging, is the plan still one turnout a year?
Ernest Freedman: Yeah, so – and, Shirley, this is Ernie. So I’d say, you said the keyword there, is we have to balance. We have multiple goals that we want to achieve. We want to achieve earnings growth. We want to achieve good NOI growth. We want to achieve margin expansion. And at the same time, we want – we’re seeing, just where the market is at today and having some more tools in the toolkit from a cost of capital perspective, the opportunity to be a net acquirer. Against that is we also do want to bring leverage down. So there are a lot of different things, lot of different balls we’re juggling there at the same time. We have said specifically with the balance sheet on – with normal course, with excellent – NOI growth and EBITDA growth that most people are expecting over the next period of time, it’s not quite a turn year anymore that leverage would come down. We’ve kind of gotten past some of the easier stages there. But it’s probably more in the half to 3 quarters of a turn. So I just want to make sure that’s out there and people understand that. But we do have that opportunity. And one of the earlier questions talked about that, potentially over equitized acquisitions. We’ve been fortunate that a year ago we wouldn’t have predicted the cost of debt would be as inexpensive today as it is now, so that certainly helps as well. We put ourselves in a good position with the balance sheet, make an even safe are still with the refinancing. We can accomplish many of those goals maybe not each of the individually to the fullest extent, because they do counterbalance each other, but do very well against all of them. And gets replaced that we’re comfortable with that would check all those boxes in a positive way. And importantly, in a positive way relative to other real estate opportunities that maybe out there for investors.
Shirley Wu: Great. That’s helpful. So my next question has to do with demand. And you kind of touched upon this a little as well in your prepared remarks, Dallas. But on the demand side, what we’re hearing especially in the apartments is that in 2020, they’re expecting a moderation in demand for the apartment customer. So how are you feeling about the consumer demand strength going into 2020? And what differentiates the customer base?
Charles Young: Well, it’s hard to predict in – this is Charles, by the way. It’s hard to predict in the 2020, we can react to what we’re seeing on the ground, right now, which is really positive demand. As we’ve talked about all year, the top-line growth has been really strong, we’ve seen demand throughout the year. We finished off the Q3 in really good shape up on occupancy as well as on rent growth and went into Q4 here in a good position, and we continue to see solid demand. We don’t see any reason that that would slow down in 2020, but we’ll see what’s ahead.
Shirley Wu: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Hey, thanks. Charles or Ernie, could you a breakout of the drivers within the repair and maintenance line item specifically perhaps how wages are growing versus material costs? Because I don’t understand how costs are going 10% during a period, where turnover is going down and costs went up 13% in the year ago period?
Ernest Freedman: Yeah, John, let me start with that, and then I’ll turn it over to Charles as well. I think importantly, John, I would advise don’t just look at the operating expenses associated with repairs and maintenance in isolation. I would advise, look at total net cost to maintain, but importantly you look at the CapEx side too, absolutely, right to point out that our repairs and maintenance operating costs for just this 1 quarter for the last 90 days were up 9.7%. But our CapEx costs were down 5.2% in that same period, as I’m sure you saw on our disclosures. So on a total basis, it’s up 1.8%. So we certainly are doing our best to keep that as low as possible, but I also don’t feel so bad about that is up less than 2% on a year-over-year basis, specifically, we have talked about in the past so there are some cost pressures with regards to personal items of our superintendents and things like that you have general cost inflation. And I also point out that again as we look at this short period of time out of the longer period from a month-to-month basis, sometimes on a year-over-year basis you have different results in the first part of this the third quarter. We did see some better performance in repairs and maintenance and the third month, it was a hot September, that offset a more normal July and August for us from summer and those things happen. I think, it was more to point out that not to get too hung up on just a 1 quarter basis, when you’re looking at things, and you look at overall for all of our expenses. And I went back and looked at this John, prior to the call just to get a sense for where we’re coming in from an expense perspective. We’ve done pretty well over the last 3 years, I mean, look at our other expenses. In 2017, they were down 6.2%, in 2018, which was a tough year for us with regards to the merger and we certainly talked about that a bit on past calls with you and with other investors, they were up 2.5% this year based on our guidance the predicted to be down 0.5%. So over that 3 year period, that’s a CAGR of about down 1.4%. That said, we want to do better, we think we can do better, there’s areas specifically can do better. And we’re excited about the upside to it, but from the 1 quarter specific to R&M, I get it to the operating side was up, the CapEx side was down to help offset that our total cost to maintain for the quarter was only up 3.7% for the year is actually down a little bit. So we feel good about where expenses are, but we do can see, we think we can do better.
John Pawlowski: Okay. I know, I understand CapEx looks better this quarter. But in year-to-date, I expect, total cost to maintain to be down meaningfully given the cost around last year and the merger synergies that investors paid up for within a few days of the merger, so perhaps, we can talk more online. Charles, could you give offline? Charles, could you give some commentary on sequential revenue growth trends in South Florida and Houston, which looked a bit weak?
Charles Young: Sure. I’ll start with South Florida, I think, we talked about it on the last call. South Florida is actually flat as you look at it Q3 year-over-year, but when you look at it year-to-date, occupancy is actually up 40 basis points, which is great. We are seeing, I think, I mentioned this last time a little bit of oversupply in the market. So we’re regulating on the rent growth side to make sure that we keep that occupancy and we’ve been able to maintain that into the fourth quarter. So we’re watching it closely, it does – performance does vary by submarket, and the field teams are working very closely with asset management and doing a great job with selectively pruning, and so as Dallas was talking about some of those dispositions you may see a few more coming out of South Florida. But overall, we’re keeping the occupancy, where we want and we’re having to give up a little bit on rate. Moving over to Houston, actually, Houston seen a really – has had a great year. Year-to-date occupancy of 96.3% versus 94.6% last year, so really a healthy move there, blended Q3, blended rent growth is actually up 180 basis points to 2.6%, again as we’re getting more occupancy were able to push rate, it’s not keeping up with some of our other markets, but it’s doing pretty well. I think, what you may be seeing is there was a sequential kind of down from Q2 to Q3, which is normal. And that kind of seasonal trend that will see as you get towards the end of Q3, and leasing comes down a little bit. But we were coming out of Q2 at a high watermark of 97.3%. So it come down to the 95% is not that big of a deal and what we expect seasonality for market.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Douglas Harter of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harter: Thanks. Can you talk about how October is performing in terms of occupancy and rental?
Ernest Freedman: Yeah, because the months not quite done yet, Doug. We’re not prepared to provide final results. We can tell you it is meeting our expectations and built in to our expectations around guidance from both on occupancy perspective as well as rental rates achievement for us.
Douglas Harter: All right. Thanks. And then as far as that you continued improvement internal work, can you talk about what are the key drivers of that improvement in turnover and kind of aspirationally there where turnover can go?
Charles Young: Yeah. This is Charles. First, we think that turnover is really driven by the quality of our homes and the quality of our service. We do know that there’s an affordability factor out there and we’re an attractive option for residents, who want to have high quality homes and great neighborhoods and good schools. That being said, we know that trees don’t grow to the sky, and we have had real success in our low watermark below 30% for the first time on a trailing 12, can’t predict where that’s going. We’re just going to continue to provide great service and Dallas and team are continued to purchase great homes and we think it’s going to will be at the low end of that turnover curve.
Douglas Harter: Thanks, Charles.
Charles Young: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Green with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Jason Green: Good morning. Just a question on disposition CapEx, the number seems to balance around quarter-to-quarter, but can you explain specifically what that spend is? And then whether there is a reasonable figure on average, we can think about per home sold?
Ernest Freedman: Yeah, Jason. This is Ernie. So you’re going to see a bounce around those depending on the type of sale, we do. So we’re doing sale to an Investor Day will take the home as is, and they underwrite it to their own economics, any rehab or they may want to do post-acquisitions like we do. For selling mostly a user home that does represent, when some is moved out of the house. And it absolutely, we want to get in the state ready to be able to sell to an end user and it can vary from being a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars. But we factor that in with regards to with the right economics and how they want to treat that house, for that perspective and also only make the decision around with leading end user sell or investor sell. Let’s give some thought, Jason, as to I don’t want it as to what number you guys can expect to have, it’s going to be an impact like I said by the type of sale that’s done. But for those that go through the end user. Let’s give some thought, Greg and I can get back and then maybe give folks an idea of, for modeling perspective, what an average type of costs could be, I just want to bring it on the call here with you.
Jason Green: Okay. No, I understood. And then the other question would be during the quarter about 10% of the dispositions were in California. And this may be more specific to the end user, so if you guys have been talking about what was the rationale specific to the assets? Or are there certain markets in California, where you guys are starting to feel that you’re topped out value was kind of neither of those 2?
Ernest Freedman: Well, I think it’s a little bit of a blend, in certainly in California we’ve seen some homes appreciate to a point, where we think highest and best use of capital would be to sell those homes and then reinvest in parts of either California other parts of markets where we can drive better overall risk adjusted return. There’s also a couple of submarkets, they quite frankly we think from a service model perspective and ultimately a performance perspective that we haven’t been real bullish on now take that with a grain of salt, because I think we sold year-to-date maybe less than 200 homes, little over 250 homes in all of California. So it’s a really small part of the overall portfolio. But, yes, on the margin just like we do with any market, we’re looking at the bottom performing 5% of the assets. And then making decisions with the operating teams on what’s the best path forward, and then in some situations selling because of value.
Jason Green: Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin of Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: Hey, good morning. Dallas you mentioned the granular nature of the acquisitions completed during the quarter. Most of the thing, you can talk about any bulk acquisition opportunities you may have come across the radar during the quarter, so where pricing is on those assets relative to the yield, which are probably a little higher kind of the more granular and the composition of the acquisition pool. Just curious what you’re seeing on pricing, how many portfolios are out there that sort of meet the criteria that invitation typically looks at. And color would be helpful.
Ernest Freedman: Yeah. So in terms of one-off, and how we see that environment today is definitely accretive to our portfolio and most of the markets we’re in today, we’re seeing some good opportunities to buy, some good opportunities to invest. In terms of bulk, some of those larger transaction opportunities are fewer and far between, we certainly as an asset management group take whatever information is available to us some of our bigger operating partners out in the market and try to overlay and look for where there could be potential strategic opportunities. We’re not in a position to talk really about any of that and/or do you see many of those opportunities at any given point. But you saw, we did it earlier in the year in Las Vegas, you will on occasion see some smaller – bulk opportunities that will come across the desk, where you can really get us down underwriting process to, and then hopefully be able to purchase to attractive prices. Las Vegas was a great example, where ahead great execution our rehab CapEx underwritings been spot on and we’ve actually been out performer in terms of going in rate. So we’d love to see more of them, quite frankly, we just don’t get the opportunities too. But occasionally do get something that comes across the desk. But the environment today, it feels pretty tight on the bulk side of things.
Drew Babin: Thank you. And then a couple for Ernie here. In the third quarter was a $50 million opportunistic secured debt pay down, as we model going forward, and then it’s presumably more assets are bought and sold is there sort of a run rate amount of debt may get paid down opportunistically going forward as part of the deleveraging story. Is there anything that we should sort of be modeling? Or is that something we should be leaving alone for now?
Charles Young: Yeah, I think, it’s more the latter, Drew. We come out next quarter with guidance around acquisition disposition activity, I think, it will be more apparent is what may be available from a cash flow perspective or not for additional debt pay down beyond the normal course for us. But at this point, it would be hard to say there’s a run rate that would be consistent over the next couple of years for you go to in the model.
Drew Babin: Okay. And lastly, the ATM almost anything executed in October from above and beyond what was listed for Q3, when the price of the stock went up?
Ernest Freedman: Yeah. There have been no executions in October on the ATM.
Charles Young: Okay. Great. That’s all for me. Thanks.
Operator: And our next today comes from Hardik Goel of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Hardik Goel: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about renewal rates, and what you’re seeing in terms of pricing power, obviously, a blended was strong. But how do you see the tradeoff between new and renewals? And I noticed that for a little sequentially, and just wanted to get your thoughts on that, and what you see going forward?
Charles Young: Yeah. So this is Charles. Renewal rate year-to-date through Q3 has been 5.1% it’s really strong from 4.8% last year. So we had some great execution early in the year. As we come into Q3 and we know we’re going a little lower leasing – slower leasing season and trying to make sure that we optimize the portfolio in the Q4. You may see us regulate that down a little bit just to make sure that we’re keeping occupancy. And it varies market by market, depending on where we are on occupancy. So it’s been overall a strong renewal year, I think, we’ll continue that. But you may see it come down slightly here in Q4, as we make sure that we want to set up 2020 it’s really strong year.
Hardik Goel: Thanks. That’s all.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. It’s [indiscernible] for Haendel. Back to revenues and expenses, do you guys see any margin expansion going into next year? Or what could be a potential headwind or tailwind into next year?
Ernest Freedman: Yeah. I want to be careful about and getting too specific about that, because that is supporting on them, but potentially providing guidance for revenue and expenses last year. But I’d say, over the longer-term, and I say it won’t happen next year and someone provides specific guidance. We certainly see a great opportunity for margin expansion. On the revenue side, we have opportunity to do a little bit better as we talked about in our Investor Day very specifically, and Dallas talked about in those prepared remarks around some of the ancillary items that are high margin drop to the bottom line and things like resident goes right to the bottom lines for the occupancy. So we see opportunities there, and then on the expense side, we’re going to fight the battle inflation. But we do think over the next period of time, real estate tax growth will be more muted than it’s been the last few years for a combination of reasons one, home prices are still going up and I’m going as much – up as much as they were the last few years. So that will help. And secondly some of the internal things we’ve had to deal with real estate taxes due to rules and certain states about when corporate activity happens like our merger like our IPO and things like that those will be fully earned, and so those will certainly help us on the expense side going forward. So that given specific guidance for next year, we do see the opportunity to bring margins up from the mid-60s or at today to the higher 60s over the next period of time.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. And you just touched upon about what some other types of benefits, could you think you can generate from improved efficiencies and ancillary revenues moving forward?
Ernest Freedman: Yeah. On the ancillary items, we talked about the fact that we think there are services that we can provide residents that they will value that will help them likely want them to stay in our homes longer, and we can collect income off of those. So it’s kind of a win-win, it’s something they want and it’s something that will help us, we talked about specifically some things around, making sure, we’re doing things with the right around one test. We talked about our filter program, which will help me along and help on the repairs and maintenance side as well as and add be a convenience for residents. And of course, we’ve talked about for a long time, you think it’s a greater opportunities with our smart home offerings and things that we’re doing there. On the expense side, it’s just really all about just getting better and more efficient what we do in utilizing technology to do that and that was certainly a big part of what we discussed with investors and analysts, I know people a chance to tune in a few weeks go on that as well. So we just see when you factor all that in and then what’s happening macro fundamentally in the industry with regards to supply and demand things that’s I think why people are so excited and favorable about this space and certainly an opportunity to participate in those upsides.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Please go ahead.
Jade Rahmani: Thank you very much. I was wondering, if you could provide some additional color on the asset sales, and what percentage of those are driven by CapEx expectations? And are there any common attributes in terms of price point geography level of rent et cetera?
Dallas Tanner: Yeah, Jade. In your question, I think, you did a nice job of summarizing the different types of buckets that we look at. There’s definitely some that are geographic, there are some that are based on call it maybe some future potential CapEx risk, that’s ordinary course for us in terms of how we analyze the portfolio. And to get a little bit until we will rank our properties based on quality type and location internally, and that’s not something we share externally, but it’s certainly a metric and part of our proprietary systems of how we look and rank ourselves in terms of performance and overall expectations around what we may or may not need to put into an asset over the long-term. We’re probably a bit more focused right now and just making sure we get submarket – specific submarket alignment, the way that we want our portfolios be able to operate. And so we work very closely with Charles and his team, in terms of making sure that not only the portfolio mix. It’s right, but that also that we have the right shift mix within the portfolio in terms of size, bedroom, bath counts the right ratio et cetera. That’s all very important in terms of how we offer a consistent service level to our customer. So it can be a variety of things. It could be geographic. It could be that we think our homes are quite frankly too big. And it has potential turn risk to it. So we’re very sensitive about some of those things. All goes into the formulas that we look at, in the ways that we measure success internally.
Jade Rahmani: And are you trying to optimize to a certain function that maximizes future rent growth expectations or margin expansion expectations? Or are you targeting all in return on invested capital? How are you thinking about that?
Ernest Freedman: Well, to be clear, we’re total return investors, right? We are looking for value in both asset appreciation as well as where we think the potential yield on a particular asset will go. And what goes into that, Jade, are all the decisions around submarkets, markets, neighborhood, school districts and a number of different factors. And with that re-buy analysis whenever we decide to sell a home, we treat it the same way as if we were going to buy that home today. And what kind of conviction do we have around those expected total risk adjusted returns and why. And so, it’s really a similar process. And as I mentioned earlier, we’re always looking at the bottom parts of our portfolio, regardless of market or location to look at total performance. And as you look at total return, yield is one component of that. And so, all those decisions will come into play as well as some of the markets going forward.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks very much.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hi, guys. I’m just look at the blended rent growth year to date. Looks like the western region is doing almost 2X the rest of the portfolio. Would you expect that to start to converge meaningfully over the next year or two, the long-term averages? And you see supply pressure pressuring those markets on the west next year?
Dallas Tanner: Well, we see a lot of supply pressures generally across our portfolio to be clear. And in the West, you just don’t have enough rooftops to keep up with household formations. So we would expect demand to be strong generally across our portfolio. And you’re probably going to feel a little bit more of that out west with higher barrier to entry – lower barrier to entry markets, excuse me.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then, when you look at the single asset acquisitions, what is the capacity of Invitation Homes to do per quarter?
Dallas Tanner: Well, to be clear, I don’t want to – I’ll use Ernie’s line that he said, which is we don’t want to provide any specific guidance. But just in terms of historically, the things that we’ve done as a business we bought our first 30,000 homes one by one over a period of 18 months. And so, we have the abilities, the systems, the processes and people that if the market opportunity and the cost of capital is available to us, that we can certainly look for meaningful ways to grow.
Wes Golladay: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Ryan Gilbert of BTIG. Please go ahead.
Ryan Gilbert: Hey, thanks, guys. Can you talk about the lease up process for the homes that you’ve acquired this year just in terms of how they’re leasing up relative to your expectations? I guess, I’m just trying to understand to the extent that that there were some earnings dilution in the third quarter from acquisition. How much of that is from just higher volume versus maybe slower than expected lease up?
Ernest Freedman: Yeah, Ryan. And this is Ernie. I’ll take that. It’s interesting, this year we’ve actually seen on our acquisitions, we’re doing better than underwriting with regards to our rehabs, in terms of those coming in a little bit cheaper than we underwrote, so helping our current yields. We’re also seeing that those are actually running up. And the time we expected them run up at prices slightly better. So you’re right to point out there’s a dilution item, but it’s really not on the acquisition side. It’s on the disposition side. We’re seeing on the disposition side is that homes are staying – ones that we’re selling to end-users are taking a little longer for us to sell than we would have thought at the beginning of the year. And part of that is just – the reason why the acquisition opportunity is better for us right now is that we’re seeing things slow down a little bit. And so, we are seeing that – when we’re selling to the end-user, we have to vacate the house; then we have to get it ready for sale. And then we have to put under contract and sell. And that process is probably taking us about 30 to 45 days longer than we would have thought. We put our numbers together at the beginning of the year, Ryan. And so that’s what’s causing some dilution there. And it’s actually cost us about a $0.015 in terms of how long that’s taking. Now, we underwrote – we expected some of that to be in our numbers. We probably would have expected about $0.0075 to a $0.01 to be in our numbers, because it’s taking longer and because we’re selling more homes. That’s why I’ve seen a little bit more dilution. But we’re pleased with that, because we’re proving our portfolio and that dilution goes away when those homes go away. So it is a bit of a drag for us. But it’s not on the acquisition side. It’s more on the disposition side.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. Got it. Understood. And then, are there any markets where you’re seeing for-rent competition, whether it’d be other institutional operators or maybe mom-and-pop operators offering rents that are, what you would consider to be below market or like nonprofit maximizing rents?
Charles Young: Yeah, this is Charles. I’ll take that. From a professionalized perspective, we’re out there in the market with mom-and-pop, so we don’t really see them as direct competition, because we’re optimizing our portfolio, selling different than what they may be solving for. So, if there are other institutional market or professional firms out there, they’ll show up in some of the Southwest markets that we’re seeing, whether it’s Florida, Atlanta, and otherwise. But they’ve been there the whole time. Now, there may be a few more pushing in and we see some supply of pieces as I talked about in South Florida, a little bit in Orlando right now, although we’re still performing well there, so – but nothing that’s materially impacting. You could see from our results and our occupancy being up and our blended rent growth being up almost 50 basis points. It’s not slowing us down. But we are watching it closely and paying attention to what the competition is doing.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay, got it. And just one more quick one, in Phoenix, can you talk about the submarkets that you’re seeing the most opportunities to buy in?
Dallas Tanner: Yeah, I mean in Phoenix you got to be particularly focused on staying in site the major beltways, the 101 and 202 freeways. I think that’s where we’re seeing terrific amount of events. Our stuff in Tempe and also South Scottsdale has done really, really well. Anything in the East Valley is strong as well. That market has a tremendous amount of net migration, employment growth and quite frankly not enough supply to keep up with demand. So generally, the market as a whole strong, but anything on the interior is doing really well.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And today’s final question comes from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Hey, everyone. How are you doing? Just quickly back to the ATM, so $800 million and really just the plans to balance it between the leveraging and home acquisitions, I guess, so far, it’s been mostly focused on home acquisitions. But in the light of any progress with respect to the ratings agencies and what they’ve guided or shared with specifics that they want to see as you work toward an investment grade rating? Clearly, this looks like an opportunity to push in that direction if you guys can just comment on that. And that would be it for me. Thank you.
Ernest Freedman: Yeah, Derek. Hey, it’s Ernie. If I’m not surprising, I’m taking this one. Specifically around the balance sheet, we’re going to look at all opportunities to bring leverage down in a smart way, in a balanced way, because we want to have lower leverage. Again, I want to make sure I reiterate and people heard me say this. We have a safe balance sheet today. We’ve done what we said we’re going to do in terms of delevering over – since our IPO. We made good progress there. We [see bit of] [ph] cash flow growth. We’ve actually accelerated, making the balance sheet even safer still through refinancing activity, going from about 80% hedge position in terms of fixed rate to closer to 100%, so all those things feel good. And there is a point in time where it may make sense to look for other source of the capital, bring leverage down other than cash flow from operations to delever further. And we’ll be opportunistic about that, where it makes sense. But for us, when we think about deploying capital, whether it’s to grow the business externally by acquiring, what this is – we’ll factor in where the cost of capital is, where that makes them the best long-term sense for us. We want to balance what we’re trying to accomplish amongst all our goals. I mentioned earlier around earnings, around external growth, around margin expansion and things like that. And so, it’s kind of a long way of saying, we will keep that option open for us and if it makes sense for us to move forward, we’ll consider using the ATM in the right way so that will create value for our shareholders over the long term.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you. We’d like to thank everyone for joining us again today. We appreciate everyone’s interest in Invitation Homes. And look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming Nareit conference. Operator, with that, that will conclude our call.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Today’s conference has now concluded. And we thank you all for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-31 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Invitation Homes Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Greg Van Winkle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greg Van Winkle: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. On today's call from Invitation Homes are Dallas Tanner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer. I would like to point everyone to our second quarter 2019 earnings press release and supplemental information, which we may reference on today's call. This document can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. I would also like to inform you that certain statements made during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. During this call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with the most comparable GAAP measures, in our earnings release and supplemental information, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dallas Tanner.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you, Greg. Our business is firing on all cylinders as we move through the midpoint of the year. Fundamental tailwinds persist operational execution remains terrific on our fully integrated platform. We continue to create value through capital recycling and active asset management and we are making important strides with our balance sheet.  I would like to elaborate on a few things in my comments. First, the drivers of our outsized growth and strong results second, some detail on our capital recycling efforts and third why I'm even more excited about the future. I will start with our performance building on a great start in the first quarter of 2019 highlights of our second quarter included over 6% same-store NOI growth, our best ever second quarter occupancy of 96.5% at the same time, both new and renewal rent growth were above 5% and prior year levels and it over 7% reduction in controllable costs net of resident recoveries, this performance was driven by favorable fundamentals, our differentiated portfolio and service and outstanding execution by our teams. The facts around industry dynamics in our value proposition are simple. Household formation in our markets is robust, supply is limited and home price appreciation continues to outpace inflation. In a market where attractive housing options can be difficult to find, we offer a solution that allows residents to live in high quality homes in desirable neighborhoods at a fair price and enjoy the ease of leasing from a professional management company that puts the resident first. This is especially true across our unique market footprint, where household formations are expected to grow at almost twice the U.S. average in 2019. And we are the monthly cost to lease a home remains almost 10% below the cost to own a comparable home. In addition, our industry leading scale with over 4,700 homes per market, on average, enable us to efficiently deliver best in class resident service that enhances residents' satisfaction and retention. Our field teams are now delivering that service better than ever and powered by enhancements to our operating platform. With better data and tools, our revenue management team continues to strike the right balance between occupancy and rent growth and on the expense side, our efficiency initiatives continue to be effective at reducing controllable costs even during the busier summer months. On the back of this strong year-to-date execution we are raising our 2019 same-store NOI growth guidance range to 5% to 5.5%, an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint. Ernie will elaborate on our updated guidance later on in the call. Next, I will provide an update on our capital recycling efforts. Midway through the year, we have made excellent progress against our capital allocation plan. In the first half of 2019, we sold 1,433 homes for gross proceeds of $360 million and use these proceeds to acquire 948 homes for $273 million and to delever.  In doing so, we removed many lower quality and less advantageously located homes from within our portfolio and reposition capital into the homes and locations where we have real conviction in risk adjusted total returns.  We have been able to find compelling opportunities to accomplish this because of the advantage of our local presence in markets and the diversity of channels we employed to both buy and sell homes. Just in the first half of 2019, we have bought homes in both transactions, one-off transactions, the MLS at auction from home builders and through iBuying platforms. We have also sold homes both in bulk and one-off transactions as well as directly to residents. After successful execution in the markets in the first half of 2019, we now expect to finish near or above the high end of the initial $300 million to $500 million guidance we laid out at the beginning of the year for both acquisitions and dispositions. In other words, we are enhancing our portfolio quality in 2019 even more than we had initially anticipated. In closing, I would like to talk about all of the opportunity that lies in front of us. Earlier on the call I discussed the supply and demand drivers that have underpinned our outsized growth. Looking ahead, we are even more encouraged as we have yet to enjoy the full benefit of the millennial generation that is coming our way. Over 65 million people or one-fifth of the US population is aged 22 to 34 years and we believe many in this cohort could choose the single-family leasing lifestyle as they form families and age toward Invitation Homes average resident age of 39 years. We also have tremendous potential to create value beyond the organic opportunity and are shifting more attention to how we can make the resident experience even better. This includes building on the basics by refining our already best in class system and processes for interacting with residents and providing genuine care, carrying out the ProCare commitment to proactive service and more hands on resident care at move in and move out that our platform is now equipped to provide to all homes in our portfolio. Expanding ancillary services, which we have recently brought on a dedicated team to pursue continuing to grow and refine our value enhancing CapEx program and making the leasing process even more efficient and getting new residents in home quicker. Finally from an external growth and portfolio perspective, our locations and scale are significant competitive advantage today, but we have the opportunity to widen those advantage even further. As we move forward, scale gives us the ability to be selective and continue recycling capital to enhance the quality of our portfolio at the margins and as we have done throughout our history, we will continue to grow scale when the right opportunities arise in the right markets. In summary, I'm very proud of the way we are executing and driving growth today, but I'm even more excited about the opportunity that lies ahead for our business to become even better. With that, I will turn it over to Charles Young, our Chief Operating Officer, to provide more detail on our second quarter operating results.
Charles Young: Thank you. Dallas. Once again, we were able to build on positive momentum to drive another great quarter operationally on both the revenue and cost side. I'm even proud of our team's success this quarter because it came in a seasonally busier time of year.  Managing through peak season for leases, turns and maintenance. The quality of our resident service is not wavered. This is most evident in our turnover numbers, which achieved yet another record-low of 30.1% on a trailing 12 month basis. We still have work to do and we remain in the midst of peak season, but I couldn't be more thankful for how our teams have executed thus far. I will now walk you through our second quarter operating results in more detail.  With outstanding fundamentals in our markets and excellent execution, same-store NOI increased 6.1% year-over-year in the second quarter, same-store revenues in the second quarter grew 4.2% year-over-year.  This increase was driven by an average monthly rental rate growth of 4% and a 40 basis point increase in average occupancy to 96% for the quarter. Same-store core expense in the second quarter increased 0.6% year-over-year. Controllable costs were better than expected, down 7.2% year-over-year net of resident recoveries.  The primary drivers of this improvement were lower turn volume and efficiency enhancements through our integrative operating platform that drove lower R&M and personnel costs, offsetting a significant improvement in controllable costs was a 7% increase in property taxes. We do not expect to achieve the same degree of improvement in controllable costs in the second half of 2019 as we did in the first half as prior year comps become less favorable. That said, we still see upside the cost efficiency. In addition to the benefit of constant refinements to our systems and processes going forward, we expect our full ProCare roll out to bear fruit over the next several years. ProCare is our unique proactive way we serve our residents from move-in to move-out including post-movement orientations, proactive service trips and pre-move out visits. To be clear, ProCare implementation has been rolled out in all of our markets. However, the benefits to materialize over time as proactive visits drive opportunities for savings in both R&M and turn results. Next, I will cover leasing trends in the second quarter. Both renewal and new lease rent growth were higher in the second quarter of 2019 than in the second quarter of 2018. Renewals increased 70 basis points to 5.4% and new leases increased 40 basis points to 5.2%. This drove blended rent growth of 5.3% or 60 basis points higher year-over-year. At the same time, average occupancy remained 96.5% in the second quarter of 2019 in line with first quarter and 40 basis points higher year-over-year. We feel very well positioned for the second half of 2019 with occupancy better than it has ever been at this point of the year.  However, we are also approaching the point in the calendar year where new leasing activity begins to flow seasonally making it prudent to turn slightly more conservative and balancing rent growth and occupancy. We feel great about our playbook for carrying healthy occupancy through the all season and our lease expiration curve is set up to help us achieve this as well. After a great first half of 2019, we are excited to keep the momentum going and remain focused on delivering outstanding service to our residents and outstanding results to our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Ernie Freedman.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today, I will cover the following topics. One, balance sheet and capital markets activity, two financial results for the second quarter and three, updated 2019 guidance. First, I will cover capital markets activity where we opportunistically refinanced one of our near-term maturities and continue to delever. In June, we further diversified our capital sources by closing our first ever term loan from a life insurance company. Loan has a 12-year term and principal amount of $403 million.  Total cost of funds is fixed at 3.59% for the first 11 years and floats at LIBOR plus 147 basis points in the 12th year. Structural features of the loan also provide for more flexibility in collateral release and substitution rights than our other secured financings to-date. With the proceeds from this loan and other cash on hand, we repaid $529 million of higher cost secured debt in the second quarter, now leaves us with no debt maturing prior to 2022. In July, we voluntarily prepaid an additional $50 million of secured debt. Also in July, we completed settling conversions of our 2019 convertible notes with common shares bringing net debt to EBITDA to 8.4 times, down from 9 times at the end of 2018. As we go forward, we will continue to prioritize debt prepayments in pursuit of an investment grade rating. Our liquidity at quarter end was approximately $1.1 billion through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facility. Moving on to our second quarter 2019 financial results, core FFO per share increased 5.2% year-over-year to $0.31 primarily due to an increase in NOI and lower cash interest expense. AFFO per share increased 4.1% year-over-year to $0.25. The last thing I will cover is our updated 2019 guidance. After maintaining strong execution through the first stage of our peak leasing and service season and with supply and demand remaining favorable, we are tightening and increasing our full-year 2019 same-store NOI growth guidance to 5% to 5.5% versus 4% to 5% previously. This is driven by same-store core revenue expectations of 4% to 4.5% up from 3.8% to 4.4% previously and same-store core expense expectations of 2% to 3%, down from 3% to 4% previously. We are also increasing our guidance for core FFO and AFFO in step with our same-store NOI guidance increase. We now expect full year 2019 core FFO of $1.23 to $1.29 per share versus $1.21 to $1.29 previously. AFFO is expected to be $1.01 to $1.07 per share versus $0.99 to $1.07 previously. Lastly on guidance, I want to remind everyone of 2 things that will impact our results in the back half of the year from a timing perspective. First, given the progression of occupancy in 2018, occupancy comps will not be as favorable in the second half of 2019 as they were in the first half of 2019. Second, the year-over-year increase in real estate taxes is expected to be lower in the fourth quarter of 2019 than in the first three quarters of 2019. I will wrap up by reiterating Dallas' enthusiasm for the future. Fundamentals remain favorable, which we expect to continue driving strong revenue growth at the same time we enhance expense controls. Furthermore, we believe that our business is well positioned to succeed in all parts of the cycle. We are excited to begin creating more value in addition to organic growth as we ramp up our focus on enhancing the resident experience with ancillary services, value enhancing CapEx and other initiatives and last but not least, we remain active with our best-in-class investing platform to recycle capital, widen location and scale advantages within our portfolio and grow opportunistically in the right markets at the right time. With that Operator, would you please open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Douglas Harter of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harter: Thanks. Dallas, you touched on this a little bit, but given the attractive return characteristics you are seeing the supply demand, can you talk about your appetite for kind of increasing the kind of the external growth opportunities and kind of where, what markets those might be most attractive.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Doug. Yes, happy to. As I already mentioned, we are going to look for some of these opportunities in the right places at the right time as well and we are certainly seeing a bit more opportunity in the last couple of quarters in terms of grinding our incremental buying through our platform. I mentioned in my comments that we still see through a variety of channels, opportunities that are at pretty attractive return profile.  So, I would expect that will maintain an opportunistic approach that if and when we see opportunity to make sense we could then look for meaningfully ways to add to our portfolio. I think one of the benefits of being local is that we do get to see a lot of stuff off market and things that are brought to us in advance of maybe a public sale and so for us, we are going to continue to look for those opportunities.
Douglas Harter: Great and just which markets are you finding most attractive today.
Dallas Tanner: No. If you look at the balance of where we are having some of our greatest expansion in terms of rate growth and home price appreciation, certainly our West Coast markets are outperforming. A market like Phoenix is a good example of this, where over the last three months in a row we have been north of 10% from a new lease growth perspective.  We are seeing some interesting opportunities in that market. We have been able to do some things like buy directly from some boutique homebuilders in that market in Q2 and if look to do the same in markets like Seattle.  I would expect our mix to be relatively consistent with what we have done over the past couple of years, which is continue to find higher barrier to entry submarkets and parts of the West and parts of the Southeast that will continue to lend itself to that outperformance
Operator: The next question comes from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Hey, good morning guys, congrats on a good quarter. I want to just maybe focus on revenue and expenses. Revenue met our expectations, but was maybe a little bit lower than where it's trended in the past and I think the guide implies some deceleration. So I'm wondering if you could maybe just comment on that real quickly and if there is anything driving that seasonally or otherwise.
Ernie Freedman: Hey Rich, this is Ernie. So far revenues put out a little better than we expected at the beginning of the year and hence why we are able to increase guidance here with the second quarter release. We had mentioned at the beginning is we expected that rents grow, your rental rate growth would be about 4% and we are actually doing a little better than that performance right there and then we talked about at the beginning of year and it's holding true is that in the beginning - in the first quarter, I think we had 80 basis point year-over-year increase in occupancy, second quarter was 40 basis point year-over-year.  We are not going to continue to see those types of numbers reaching in the second half of the year. We think - embedded in our guidance, we expect arches to be flat to just slightly up in the second half of the year to where it was last year and so you take a roughly 4% rental increase, roughly flat occupancy and then other income for us has been trending a little bit lower from a growth rate perspective then rental rate.  That math gets you to the second half of the year that is going to be not quite as robust as the first half is still very strong relative to where else you can see and puts us in a good spot for our 4.5% guidance for the year.
Rich Hill: Got it and on the expense side of the equation, you have obviously had an impressive start to the year in terms of expense growth. It looks like there is going to be some pretty hefty implied expense growth in the second half of the year. I think I heard that taxes are going to be down, though. So maybe you could help us to square that a little bit.
Ernie Freedman: Yes, sure. So again expenses, we have had some good surprises for the first half of the year and we will remind everyone that we are still in the middle of peak season when it comes to work orders, July books aren't quite closed yet.  And of course, August and September are still war months for us when you look at our footprint. So, we still want to be cautious as we think about expenses, just as we were earlier this year, both with our first set of guidance and our second set of guidance that we just set here. That said, Rich, real estate taxes are trending sort of exactly where we expected them to trend. We said at the beginning of the year, we thought for the year taxes would be up in the 5s, somewhere between 5% and 6% year-to-date, they are 5.9% and we have mentioned a couple of times that the fourth quarter is an easier comp for us in real estate taxes. We had a big adjustment that we had a book last year in the fourth quarter.  So we are kind of right on pace for where we thought we would be at real estate taxes, as where we really have the outperformance and the team has done a phenomenal job, is around repairs and maintenance turn, all the work that is being done in ProCare that Charles talked about in our learnings and getting better and we are hopeful to see that carry through for the second half of the year and we will do our best to try to beat the numbers that we have laid out there, but again, we just want to make sure we are being cautious about where we set our guidance for the year and put ourselves in a position to hopefully exceed expectations, but we will see how the rest of the year plays out.
Rich Hill: Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
Ernie Freedman: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: The next question comes from Shirley Wu of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shirley Wu: Good morning, guys, thanks for taking the question. It was exciting when you guys mentioned that you just hired a new ancillary income team, so could you talk about some of the initiatives they seeing there that is driving the growth that we see and maybe some of the initiatives going for 2020, perhaps the smart home adoption as well.
Dallas Tanner: Sure. Hi Shirley, thanks this is Dallas. We are excited, we talk about our business really in two buckets. In the first piece being kind of the real estate ops piece which Ernie and I answered in previous questions. The second bucket is really this customer experience side of our business and we are really focused on making sure that we can deliver a best-in-class experience for our customers, which we believe will lend itself to better performance in some of those ancillary targets and other income opportunities.  Specifically, as a company, we have rolled out things around Smart home and have piloted a couple of smaller initiatives historically. Where we think there is room to improve, specifically, is around the smart home offerings and some of the added features that we can add to that package. Remember, our adoption rate has historically been between 75% and 80% and something like that.  So we are experimenting with pricing and some different offerings that we think will lend itself to even better performance hopefully in that category. The other part of what we think could drive a stickier experience for our customers may set around pets, insurances.  Some different offers working with some national partners, we are researching a bunch of kind of interesting and what we think are fine initiatives that will not only lend itself to some other ancillary, but probably make the overall experience better, which we think could potentially have a benefit to even better retention.  So if we do it right and we continue to deliver and we deliver that in a way that it feels meaningful, personal and creates connection between our customers and the property, we think it will have a lot of impact to our business.
Shirley Wu: Thanks for the color. And so back to the synergies from the merger. Previously, you mentioned that potentially there might be more on the procurement side, have you seen more of those conversations happened throughout this year and what do you think is the possible impact of potentially margin improvement for next year?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, so Shirley. Well, I would say it's like any business, you are always looking to do things better and improve. The procurements are certainly a great example. We continue to see good opportunities to leverage our scale, both on a national basis and a regional basis. At some point, we would be doing that whether there is a merger or not. That is how we kind of stop tracking merger synergy to this point, as we put the merger and integration behind us about a quarter ago. That said, we have a dedicated team and they are working hard at that and I think it's one of the many things that can help us in terms as we continue to have margin expansion going forward, as we can leverage our buying power and importantly on the procurement side, it's not just on the operating expense side that would impact our NOI margins but certainly very importantly is on the capital side.  So now things around are the appliance packages we put in, as an example, is a capital item. There is some great opportunities there too, so I think it's just going to contract by contract, working our way down from the national to the regional, all the way to local levels we are continuing to see - hoping to find some more opportunities and some more nuggets for us do slowly, but continually improve our margins.
Shirley Wu: Great, thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Dallas you talked about the transaction activity. How many more non-core homes are left to sell in the near-and medium term?
Dallas Tanner: Well, without giving any real specific guidance, because we can't really do that here. We certainly are looking to right size the portfolio post merger in terms of just making sure we have the right allocations and submarkets and at the market level.  You saw that we are pretty active through the first two quarters of this year in markets like South Florida and Chicago, and by way of just making sure that I'm really clear here, we will always be looking at the bottom performing parts of our portfolio, that will be ordinary course for us. I would bet that our activity for this year stays pretty consistent, but I wouldn't expect that we have a whole lot more to coal generally speaking.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. So as you think about kind of the more exciting opportunities you are seeing on the external growth front, and if the non-core asset sales maybe start to swell a little so you become more of a net acquirer. How do you think about funding larger scale external growth. Leverage is obviously ticked down but still is higher than where you would like, how do you think about the ability to fund any kind of net acquisition growth going forward?
Dallas Tanner: I think we want to look at anything that makes sense right. And I think at that point, we would have to look at whatever the best available cost of capital. that is in line with our general strategy would be. And so we could have a number of tools. We have a revolver that is available if we needed something in a moment's notice, we could always use a tool of issuing if we thought it makes sense or we can just continue to recycle and make smart investments.
Charles Young: And we are still very committed to where we want to go from a balance sheet perspective, so we balance out what the cost of capital that is available for us on under various tools about the opportunity for external growth.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Please go ahead.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks very much. On the amenities and ancillary services front, are there specific vendors you have identified that are offering best-in-class services, perhaps in the multifamily sector that could be exported to single family build, such things as I believe for example resident e-commerce amenities, but also in terms of improved operations. I think RealPage for example just rolled out AI tenant screening, which really expedites the tenant bidding process. Just wondering if there is any anything you are seeing on that front.
Charles Young: We are certainly talking to a number of groups that are doing work on both the single-family and the multifamily space. So you are right in that there are a lot of roll-ups occurring in the call for real estate tech space. To-date, I would say that there are also differentiated opportunities that kind of exist a little bit more in single-family or vice versa.  It could be duplicitous. It's a little bit different in terms of the nature of how long our resident stays with us, so there are, I think, additional opportunities available to us. RealPage, a number of those companies are rolling up different AI platforms and things that will help you around customer service.  We have met with a number of those types of companies and have looked at some of their products, haven't felt necessarily that any of it was yet ready for primetime for our business, but we are going to continue to maintain an opportunistic approach in terms of making sure we are getting anything that is out there.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks. I think that is an interesting point about the longer length of stay and single-family, which would seem to suggest potential greater opportunities for ancillary revenues. Just turning to the build-to-rent front today another public home builder announced joint venture considering Bryce Blair is Chairman of both IH as well as Pulte Group, you probably have unique insight. So, I'm wondering if you could share your updated thoughts on the built-to-rent sector.
Dallas Tanner: Well, I think my thoughts on build-to-rent have been pretty consistent and I think as a team, we feel the same way. We want to implore every channel to make sense, but we never want to compromise our approach to location. And so for us, if something is in the right location, we are agnostic of necessarily which channel comes through.  Now built to rent is really interesting because there is a couple of things that are going on. There is more of a garden-style apartment approach, which are smaller plots, smaller square footages which are typically done on hut financing and people are calling it build to rent and then there is communities that are being built with fit and finishes and square footage standards that line up with a single-family neighborhood that are usually much more synonymous with the product that we would own. And we certainly get approached by a lot of different angles, in terms of opportunities. We get calls all the time on that. We are open- minded to looking at buying in scale from builders, but the locations have to be in the right spots and then also the fit-finish standards, the types of sizing around square footage and what the overall amenities in that neighborhood is going to have to it good way into our decisions. Specific on your question around price, I think price does a nice job of separating church and state between the two companies. It has been terrific in terms of inside and what you are seeing in the homebuilding space, like the other members of our Board, who are close to a lot of different types of real estate. So, we certainly are going to continue to look at those opportunities and we have made some good strides, I think, with local builders and markets and have been able to review a lot of opportunity.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks very much.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Drew Babin of Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: Hey, good morning. Question on recurring CapEx, year-to-date for the total portfolio, up about 5%. I was glad to see the AFFO growth guidance range increased in tandem with FFO, can we assume about the same kind of year-over-year increase in recurring CapEx in the second half of the year and given the easy comp in the third quarter, might we even see a decline.
Dallas Tanner: Please Drew, [indiscernible] try and answer the question yourself there with the way you led that. Right, we haven't provided specific level of guidance for that, I will say is, we are actually performing a little bit better than expectations on the CapEx side and much better than expectations on the OpEx side when it to recurring cost in total around and net cost to maintain.  Part of the reason why we are confident in being able to raise AFFO range as well as FFO range is because of that behavior. So, not in a position to provide specific guidance as to how it may look relative to the first half of the year, but on overall basis, on a net cost to maintain perspective where we at the beginning of the year through we had said we thought it would be flat to up 3% and we feel pretty confident at this point that flat would be the high end of the range now in terms of where would be and maybe actually slightly down year-over-year for us.
Drew Babin: Great, that is very helpful and one more from me, just to follow-up on next question about markets, South Florida, I noticed in this new leasing spreads went negative in the second quarter. I noticed also there is really been nothing acquired this year. It's been a source of funds on the disposition side. So, I guess how do you feel about that market short term, long-term, is it a market that you still would like to be one of your top markets, do you think that is going to continue to be a source.
Charles Young: Yes. Thank you Drew. This is Charles here. We are a fan of South Florida. If you look at our performance in Q2, overall occupancy actually went up to 95.5 from 95.3, went to rent growth 2.8 versus 3.2. So, we did go down slightly, renewal rates were actually up year-over-year and to your point, the new lease rent growth, we saw some impact in certain submarkets and so with that softening, we have worked very closely.  The field teams or asset management really looked at the field markets at those submarkets and make smart kind of pruning decisions as you are seeing some of the homes that we have been selling out there, you will see a little bit more relative sales out of South Florida and it's a large market.  We have 25,000 homes in Florida overall, and it's a very large market in South Florida, also. So we can really be smart around what markets we want to be in and optimize that by pruning. So, long term, we are a fan of South Florida, but we are looking to try to optimize the portfolio short-term.
Drew Babin: Great, thanks Charles. That is all from me.
Operator: The next question comes from Hardik Goel of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Hardik Goel: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just focusing on taxes and such a big item on expenses, the run rate this year you have kind of outlined, just looking ahead and you look across your markets where appeals have come through and tax rates have been decided, what do you see going into the future as far as how much that line can kind of grow and how are the different pieces, if you look at your regions, which ones are kind of overburden.
Dallas Tanner: Yes, already I talked a little bit what has happened so far this year and without giving guidance, give you some thoughts about how we see things going in the future. This year, we talked about it last quarter. We had a significant good guy in the State of Washington, specifically with Seattle. I understand the multifamily guys are seeing that as well to surround some legislation changes that happened there.  We were pleasantly surprised - we are not surprised to see that Texas came in hot for us this year in terms of coming in high. We have had more field success than we would have anticipated so far and what we have gone - that is gone through the process here in Texas. Georgia is also running a little bit on the high side, but we haven't seen millage rate were in the appeal process there, so want to see what Georgia plays out and of course, importantly for us, our real estate tax bill really comes down in the State of Florida and we will have better information on Florida in the next month or two. When the assessments are finalized, the millage rates come out kind of in the October, November timeframe for Florida. As a matter, Florida is about 40% of our tax bill. That said, looking to the future, I think one important differentiators for us and we will get some more stability in the real estate tax line are really for two reasons, one is 20% of our portfolio is in California and we have talked about in the past and it was a little bit of a sore spot for us last year that reassessments are allowed upon corporate events and-or sale activity in California, and we were dealing with four different of those events over the last two years, when you look at the merged companies. Most of that noise is run through our numbers at this point, there is still a few more to come through, but the vast majority of that stuff is in at this point. So, California is going to reset to kind of just that normal 2% growth you see under prop 13 . So that is an important differentiator for us in terms of thinking about real estate taxes. And then we are in part of the reason why we are seeing some external growth opportunity as well is that we are seeing home price appreciation continued to be positive and continue to grow, but not at the rates that we have seen in the last couple of years that usually earns in a year or two later in the assessment process.  So longer term I think real estate taxes are stored risk to probably grow higher than inflation with the exception of California, but certainly not at the rates that we have seen in the last couple of years as home price appreciation has been so strong. So, this year we think real estate taxes will be somewhere in the 5% to 6% range as I stated earlier. There seems to be a momentum that would allow for that is start coming in a little bit more over the next few years without providing specific guidance for specific years going forward.
Hardik Goel: That is great, thanks for the color. Just one quick follow-up, if you will, indulge me. If Florida is flat. Let's say Florida doesn't change. What is the percentage growth rate in your tax rate on the same-store pool roughly like to give to speculate on a range.
Dallas Tanner: Well, we have, Florida we assumed a relatively healthy assumption in terms of the growth rate, it within our numbers and I don't want to give you the specifics on that, but certainly not flat.
Hardik Goel: On 2020 I mean. Let's assume hypothetically 2020 Florida taxes don't increase, what are the full portfolio tax growth rate then become if Florida is 0% growth.
Dallas Tanner: Sure. Well, as Florida 0% which is 40%. I'm doing some math on the fly here. California is 2%, which is at another 20%, assume for the rest of the portfolio certainly higher than inflation without we only give guidance for specific markets, but if it's 40%, your number is zero, you are going to be at a really good starting place in terms of where that would be and it needs to be clear to everyone. We are not saying, if we think Florida is going to be 0% plenty of that just presumption here just and I think you throw it.
Charles Young: Yes, no, I want you to read the transcript later and be confused Hardik about out we are talking about here.
Hardik Goel: Sorry for creating problems for your Ernie. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. I will follow-up on Rich's second half of 2019 expense question and Ernie or Charles. I guess I am scratching my head on Charles prepared remarks on the comps in the back half on controllable costs get tougher in 3Q repair and maintenance costs in 3Q 18 were up 13%, in 4Q repair and maintenances were up 10%. You had a pop in turnover in 3Q. So can you help me understand that prepared remarks comment.
Charles Young: Yes, I can give you some context for that, John. Certainly, in the third quarter real estate taxes are more difficult comp for us and the fourth quarter they are an easier comp for us. With regards to other line items that you see, we did start to earn it into some merger synergies starting in the second half of last year. Assume I don't expect we will see a stronger performance in personnel and other services, but we still see good performance and favorable performance relative to last year. And then on the R&M and turn side, we have seen some great, results with around turnover with regards to turnover keeps trending down further and further, we were cautious to make that continued trend of a continue to getting to record lows in the second half of the year, but it's certainly a possibility as we sensed over the last 7 to 8 quarters it keeps coming down.  So that could potentially be an upside for us, so maybe that is causing part of the head-scratching for you and then on R&M side, we just, we are still in the middle peak season. And so we just want to try and avoid surprises and we just want to be, as we have been all year and I know some analysts appropriately called out earlier in the year that maybe we do better than our numbers, and so far we have been happy to prove those folks right and we will just have to see how the rest of the year plays out.  We just want to have a right level of where we see things moving and have definitive answers to it and where things are, can sometimes be a touch out of your control, make sure we have the right level of caution in there as to how we see the second half of the year.
John Pawlowski: Okay, but is there any one line item surprising you guys meaningfully upside right now.
Charles Young: Well, we certainly wouldn't say [indiscernible] now looks as conservative as it was around R&M and turn. We did not anticipate turn to be down 100 of basis points, couple of hundred basis points where it was last year. So that certainly helped us out and on R&M side we had expectations that we can do better than we had laid out.  And we certainly we are striving for that, but the teams have executed really, really well and I don't want to take that for granted too early. So I would say we are pleased and we thought we had the opportunity to better R&M, but not necessarily, we are thrilled to see that even a little more than with them even in our best cases we might have thought.
John Pawlowski: Okay and back to the portfolio management side and pruning out of Chicago, one of the markets has been a big source of funds, has a full exit from Chicago been debated and could that be in the cards in the coming years.
Charles Young: No, we have been pretty consistent that we want to right size, Chicago and post merger, we actually grew. I think the team has done a really nice job of putting that portfolio in much better shape. I mean if you look at, we are starting to see a little bit better renewal growth, a little bit better new lease growth, teams executing at a much better rate, we are seeing cost to maintain get a bit better in that market. I think we have gotten out of assets that have been a bit more troublesome.  In terms of total revenue, the Midwest is stialright around 5% of our overall revenue and it's not part of our growth story. And to be totally clear, we do want to invest capital in the West Coast and in parts of markets in the Southeast that make the most sense. We will look at anything that makes sense for shareholders.  At the end of the day if there were an opportunity that we thought was accretive to shareholder value, we would look at it just like we would in terms of where we wanted to play dollars. So, I wouldn't say, John, that it's completely top of mind, but it would certainly look at anything that was ever opportunistic for our shareholders.
John Pawlowski: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Ryan Gilbert of BTIG. Please go ahead.
Ryan Gilbert: Hey, thanks guys, just a couple of regional questions, first in Texas nice improvement in blended rent growth. Can you talk about how much of that is just demand improvement in those markets versus any initiatives you are taking to improve performance.
Charles Young: Yes. Thank you, Ryan, this is Charles. Both Dallas and Houston have really had really healthy growth over the last quarter-over-quarter. Dallas specifically where we see this as a growth market for ourselves, we are fan. Occupancy has really moved toward where we want it to be in the mid-95. You want to keep, moving up from there.  We were at 94.5 last year. Blended rent growth because of that occupancy we are starting to see some increase there. So it's a little bit of a combination of the market is solid, but as we mentioned on previous calls, we have a new leader in the market, who is executing well, building a great team around her and doing a wonderful job. Houston, we have been solid over the last little while. Occupancy in Q2 is 97.3, that is up over 200 basis points. We have done a lot to try to right size our portfolio, as I talked about looking at submarkets pruning out of there a little bit and getting it to the right size and because we are starting, we have that occupancy we are getting a little bit of rent growth out of that which we haven't had in a while.  So, we were over 3% blended rent growth in Q2. So we will see how that goes through peak season, you do get some seasonality in these markets depending when school starts, but right now we are happy with where our Texas portfolio sits.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay, thanks. And then I guess you have talked broadly about rent growth tracking home price appreciation and in Seattle, Case Shiller showing a year-over-year decline in home price appreciation, but the blended rent growth is still strong there. So I'm wondering if you can talk about your expectations for Seattle and then in the near medium term, and then also how declining home price appreciation influences your investment decisions in that market. Thanks.
Charles Young: Great question. And let me be really clear, we love Seattle. We love the market. We love the fundamentals around it. We love the job growth, all the positive demographics, people are moving there, there is really good activity in that market. We have seen a little dip in home prices which to earnings point earlier, has a lot of a little bit of a more of a buying window for us, which we see is in the long-term being very accretive.  I think in Seattle today we are over 3,000 homes, we would love to see that market get bigger over time and we just think and we have seen this as we have built out our portfolios, all of our Western markets quite frankly are great examples for this as we grow from 2,000 to 5,000 to 7,000 units.  Our margin enhancement gets much more robust and our ability to optimize the operating piece of our business gets much more efficient and so we are definitely going to monitor and if you saw negative growth or something like that, maybe you would pause and watch and see what is going on, but we don't see that happening.  We are getting now toward the kind of, that you had quite a bit of appreciation over the last couple of years and you expect it to probably call a little bit, but in terms of the demand that we are seeing, I mean on a blended basis, we are still 8% to 9% in the quarter on rate talks a lot about what is happening in terms of ability to find quality housing. So we don't see that as an issue.
Ryan Gilbert: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Derek Johnston of Deutsche. Please go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Hi, everyone. How are you doing. Just quickly on the real estate taxes and I just wanted to make sure I clarify this, I'm assuming that you, could look at every single assessment and work with a third party to basically fight it. Is that correct.
Dallas Tanner: If you look at every assessment, we deal with third party, Derek, who helps us out, but we don't necessarily fight every single one that comes through. In some jurisdictions, you have to pay a fee to fight on a home by home basis and so we don't want to take on that expense, we don't think we have a legitimate opportunity to win, and then in California, which again is 20% of our portfolio, there is less, we have falling home prices, there is really not much to do there.
Derek Johnston: Okay, got it. And just with the dispo mix, what percent is represented by sales to residents right now and is this a quickly growing sub segment and how does the process typically work with tenants.
Ernie Freedman: Yes, that is great question and you know we started, what we call our resident first look program almost two years ago, really in pilot to try to figure out the demand that was there and we have a little bit of data on our move-outs and why people are moving and for what reasons, and typically that number has been really small in terms of reason for home to move to home ownership.  But we know that as I mentioned earlier, there is an emotional connection to a lot of these properties for our residents and so when we make a decision from an asset management perspective to sell a home, majority of the time we will approach the resident first in those one-off scenarios and we probably have done about 150 to-date through the pilot and it's something that we look at from a perspective of not only building goodwill with our customer base, but just making sure that we are sensitive to the needs of families may or may not have and a lot of these families do want to purchase the Invitation Home that they have been in and so for us, it's been a great program.  There is a process where we have a dedicated team that reaches out, walks through the process that we are working through some asset management decisions and we think that potentially some could be sold and if you have any interest we would love to figure out how you can make this house your home and we don't offer any financing or anything like that.  We truly are just a seller, but we can typically have pretty good title relationships and things where we can help them find opportunities in market, if they are looking for those types of things.
Derek Johnston: Alright, great. Good stuff, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Buck Horne of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Buck Horne: Hey, guys. Ernie, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit of extra guidance around your expectations on G&A trends for the rest of the year, it looks like you have had some strong benefits year-to-date. Just wondering what we should expect on the G&A line.
Ernie Freedman: Yes, usually teams will kind of save up a little extra for the end of the year, just in case. So we actually got a little ahead on some of our G&A spend in some areas. So I think it's pretty ratable for the rest of the year. So we have seen in the first half of the year on G&A buck out, expect kind of a similar run rate. It may have a little noise quarter to quarter, but not materially different as you get into the second half of the year.  And then on the property management side there, I think it's kind of a similar story. You will see a materially different change in the second half of the year we spend and property management expense versus the first half of the year.
Buck Horne: Awesome. Perfect. And just going to like resident turnover trends and just how low it seems to be trending. I was just wondering if you have been able to discern any significant shifts in the reasons that people are moving out and/or where you are getting - where people are coming in from in terms of what their prior living situation used to be. Just wondering if there is any trends in determining on these move out or move in reasons.
Ernie Freedman: Yes, for the move in reasons we don't track that formally, so we do note in the field people ask that question from time to time, we will have a formal mechanism to capture where someone is coming from and moving into in Invitation Homes house.  But on the move-outs, again consistently that the two reasons are to purchase a home in search of a life transition, interestingly enough this is the first quarter we have seen life transition was just a little bit more than purchasing home for the reason for move-out and we did see this quarter again that the reason to move out being a purchase of homes is down year-over-year. So at every quarter but 1 in the last 10 that is been the case and in the one quarter it wasn't, it was basically flat. So we continue to see a reason to buy a home to trend down and then this is the first time just barely we saw the Life transition to be the number one reason why someone has moved out versus buying a home.
Buck Horne: Thank you, guys.
Operator: And the last question will come from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Good morning, everyone. Are you finding more success in looking at top tier assets and top submarkets now that international money has pooled back and your cost of capital has improved?
Charles Young: I want to quantify what you mean by top tier was, I think what you know and I will take a stab at it. But I would say for us, we have always had a little bit higher price point asset than most of our peers and that is been delivered by design.  Every early in this business we figured out that the cost to replace a HVAC unit is for the most part, the same on a $1200 or $1300 rental as it is on $1800 or $1900 rental and so there is some longevity in terms of that approach as you think about total risk adjusted return laying out that expense factor in your numbers. I think you are right in that as the market softens as maybe there is less international buyers coming into places like Southern California, Seattle, parts of the West Coast that specifically have had a lot of pressure from foreign buyers that could be helpful to us in terms of an opportunity.  So I would agree with you there and I think we are seeing some of that in some of those markets where we are seeing a bit more supply. Let's be clear, we are not seeing six to eight or nine months of supply in still a lot of these markets, we are seeing healthier numbers like 3, 4, or 5 months of supply and so for us, we hope that will lend itself to some additional opportunity.
Wes Golladay: Yes. That was what I was looking for, good school district, well located at the freeway, new job growth and along that line of thought, do you see much dispersion in your rent growth in markets we just see that they rolled up number, but just looking at maybe some of your best located assets are they outpacing meaningfully the maybe your secondary assets in the submarket or in a markets such as Seattle, Southern California, Northern California.
Ernie Freedman: Yes, I mean, let me answer that two ways. I kind of want to make sure I answer your question. Generally across markets, in our West Coast markets are through the - call it year-to-date are performing at much greater levels in terms of rate growth. I would agree with you there and we are seeing north of 7% year to-date, almost 8% quarter-to-date in our West Coast markets.  The rest of our markets are generally pretty healthy between anywhere from 3% to 4.5% at the submarket level absolutely and these are the things that Charles and I talk about all the time across our asset management processes.  We have broken our portfolio into a couple of hundred different submarkets and we look at that on a week-to-week, month to month, quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year basis and more importantly all of that data feeds into our revenue management model and our growth models and so as we are making decisions around calling or selling assets like Charles mentioned earlier in South Florida. We are making very deliberate decisions based on where we think our portfolio will lend itself to the greatest performance, and are there any issues or preventative decisions we can make now around risk around asset type for costs in the future, preventative cost decisions that always into both what we would like to sell and where we would like to allocate capital going forward. Does that answer your question?
Wes Golladay: Yes, no that is exactly - yes, definitely I was looking more toward the granular look into the submarkets, much like multifamily does so yes, perfect, thank you.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: I just want to thank everyone for joining us again today, we appreciate everyone's interest in Invitation Homes. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming conferences and our Investor Day in October. Operator, this concludes our call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-07 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Invitation Homes First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Greg Van Winkle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greg Van Winkle: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. On today's call from Invitation Homes are Dallas Tanner, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer. I'd like to point everyone to our first quarter 2019 earnings press release and supplemental information, which we may reference on today's call. This document can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. I'd also like to inform you that certain statements made during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other nonhistorical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. During this call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with the most comparable GAAP measures, in our earnings release and supplemental information, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dallas Tanner.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you, Greg. Let me start by saying this is a very exciting time for our business right now. With 18% AFFO growth in the first quarter, we are off to a great start to 2019 and are hitting our stride with merger integration in the rear view mirror. We are thrilled to go into peak season with everyone on a singular unified platform that features better tools than we've ever had before. Cost efficiency initiatives have also been more impactful than expected so far in 2019 enabling us to increase our NOI, core FFO and AFFO guidance, which Ernie will discuss in more detail. We are continuing to get more efficient and we're not stopping. In my comments, I'd like to touch on three things. First, our strong start to the year. Second, the work our teams have done to wrap up merger integration and third, an update on our capital recycling efforts. I hope everyone had a chance to review the results we reported last night. Highlights of our first quarter performance included 7.3% same-store NOI growth, our best ever first quarter average occupancy of 96.5%. New and renewal rent growth that outpace prior year and a 9% decrease in net cost to maintain. Let me add some color on what is driving these results. In short, it comes down to three things. Favorable market fundamentals, our unique competitive advantages and strong execution. Fundamentals are fantastic. New single-family supply is not keeping pace with demand, especially in Invitation Homes markets where household formations in 2019 are expected to grow at almost 2% or 90% greater than the U.S. average. With the millennial generation aging toward our average resident age of 40 years old, we are convinced more and more people will continue choosing the convenience of a professionally managed single-family leasing lifestyle. The affordability of leasing a home versus buying a home also continues to work in our favor. What makes Invitation Homes unique is our locations. Residents are able to enjoy the affordable and convenient single-family leasing lifestyle I just described, while also living in attractive neighborhoods close to their jobs and great schools. Our scale also enables us to deliver a high quality service to our residents at a more efficient costs and provides us with a large amount of unique data that are best-in-class revenue management system can digest to give us a clear picture of the market. On that note, we continue to get better and better at execution. Our revenue management team and field teams have worked together to develop and refine the data and process for achieving the right balance between rental rate and occupancy. On the expense side the simplification of our organization and systems are driving better results with the integration now behind us. Newly implemented repairs and maintenance initiatives are also making us more efficient and we see additional opportunity to improve as we rollout ProCare more fully across our portfolio. All of that came together to drive first quarter results that we were very pleased with, but we still have work to do. The most important part of the year lies ahead as leasing activity and service requests pickup in the spring and summer months. We are optimistic given the momentum we are carrying into peak season, but recognize that it takes even more diligence to maintain operational excellence during this period. Our teams are well prepared and energized for this task ahead. Next, I want to command and thank our teams across the country for the supper job they have done with the final piece of merger integration. Our unified operating platform has now been implemented in each of our 17 markets. With one team operating on one platform, our teams are excited to be equipped with better systems and fewer distractions to do what they do best, focus on the resident and deliver world class service every day. We also continue to innovate and take the opportunity to identify additional areas for platform and process improvements as we start moving on from the integration. Finally, we continue to refine our portfolio and have made significant strides already in 2019 towards our capital recycling goals for the year. In the first quarter, we sold 654 homes with lower long-term growth prospects for gross proceeds of $155 million. In addition to deleveraging, we use proceeds from these sales to acquire 208 homes with better quality and location for $62 million of investment. In April, we acquired 463 homes and in-fill submarkets of Atlanta and Las Vegas in a bulk acquisition for $115 million. 99% of these homes are occupied with average in place rents of $1,554 per month, which we believe is well below current market rates. In addition, we expect to achieve higher operating margins by bringing these homes into our platform with greater economies of scale. I'll wrap up by reiterating how enthusiastic I am about the future of Invitation Homes. It's exciting to see everything we have worked hard on for the last 18 months of integration fall into place. Now our operating teams continue to get more efficient. Our asset management teams continue to enhance the portfolio. And our capital markets teams continue to reduce leverage on our balance sheet. I believe we are better equipped more than ever to drive growth and deliver an outstanding living experience for our residents. With that, I'll turn it over to Charles Young, our Chief Operating Officer to provide more detail on our first quarter operating results.
Charles Young: Thank you, Dallas. Our team's carried the momentum from the end of 2018 and to another strong quarter to kick off 2019. I'm proud of the results we put on the board and the progress we made on controllable expenses. At the same time, we navigated through platform integration in the field. And most of all I'm proud that the quality of our resident service continues to achieve new heights evidenced by further declines in residents turnover. The occupancy in our portfolio and enthusiasm of our teams are showing towards residents service put us in a great position for the upcoming peak season. And we're excited to tackle it together on one platform. I'll now walk you through the first quarter operating results in more detail. Without standing fundamentals in our markets and excellent execution from our teams, same-store NOI increased by 7.3% in the first quarter. Same-store core revenues in the first quarter grew 4.7% year-over-year. This increase was driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 4.1% and a 80 basis point increase in average occupancy to 96.5% for the quarter. Same-store core expenses in the first quarter were down 0.1% year-over-year. Controllable costs were better than expected down 10.2% year-over-year net of resident recoveries. A portion of this improvement is attributable to a favorable comparison to the first quarter of 2018 when repairs and maintenance work order volume was higher than normal. However, the majority of our outperformance versus our expectation for the first quarter was due to great execution from our teams. In particular, I’ll point the three things our teams accomplish that contributed to the results. First, we had success continuing to drive system and process improvements for repairs, maintenance and turns. Second, we incurred lower resident turnover. And third, we realize property-level merger synergies as a result of our integration efforts. Partially, offsetting the significant reduction in our controllable costs was a 4.8% increase in same-store property taxes. Next, I'd like to expand on one of the main drivers of our strong quarter that I just mentioned. Our efficiency gains for the repair and maintenance or an R&M. On last quarter's call, I talked about the fourth quarter rollout of an important update to our technology platform that enabled all of our internal technicians to perform work on any home in our portfolio. Not just the homes associated with their legacy organization. This made a significant difference in the productivity of our maintenance technicians and resulted in an uptick and the percentage of service requests addressed in-house rather than by third parties. We are pleased with the impact that had on our first quarter results, but we are not celebrating it. Maintenance volume increases significantly in the spring and summer months, demanding even stronger execution from our team. In line with normal seasonal trends, we don't expect to see the same level in-house completion percentage in peak season that we saw in the first quarter. That said, I believe, we are well positioned for the task ahead. Now the integration is behind us and with all of the R&M systems and process improvements we've made over the last nine months. I'll now provide an update on the integration of our field teams. As Dallas mentioned, we have implemented our unified operating platform in every market. This is an important milestone for our company. It will allow our field teams to operate in a much simpler environment with better tools at their disposal. It also allows our teams to get back to basics and the vote all of their attention to providing exceptional resident service and operational execution. Feedback from our field teams have been extremely positive and they're excited to enter peak season altogether on one system. I'm also happy to report we accomplished this integration in the field ahead of schedule and with more synergies than the midpoint of our guidance. Integration efforts had unlocked $54 million of synergies on an annualized run rate basis as of March 31, 2019. This compares the guidance in the $50 million to $55 million range of synergy achievement by the end of the second quarter 2019. In addition, we'll be better positioned to push for more procurement savings going forward and to take the next step in rolling out our ProCare Service model across our portfolio. Finally, I'll cover leasing trends in the first quarter and April 2019. Both renewal and new lease rent growth were higher in the first quarter of 2019 than they were in the first quarter of 2018. Renewals increased 30 basis points to 5.2% and new leases increased 110 basis points to 3.6%. This drove blended rent growth of 4.7% or 70 basis points higher year-over-year. At the same time, resident turnover continued to decrease reaching an all time low of 31% on a trailing 12-month basis. As a result, average occupancy in the first quarter of 2019 increased 80 basis points year-over-year to 96.5%. Rent growth and occupancy trends remained very encouraging in April as well. Blended rent growth in April averaged 5.5%, up a 100 basis points year-over-year. And occupancy averaged 96.6% of 40 basis points year-over-year. With fundamental tailwinds at our back and occupancy in a strong position, we are confident as we entered peak leasing and maintenance season. I like to send a huge thank you to our teams for putting us in this position by focusing on resident service and operational excellence, while also working diligently to complete the integration of our platform. With that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Ernie Freedman.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today, I will cover the following topics: Balance sheet and capital markets activity, financial results for the first quarter and updated 2019 guidance. First, I'll cover balance sheet and capital markets activity, where we continue to build on the progress we made in 2018 by deleveraging further. In the first quarter in April of 2019, we prepaid $250 million of secured debt using cash generated from operations and dispositions. The debt we prepaid carried a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR + 255 basis points. Our first quarter activity brings net debt to EBITDA to 8.6 times, down from nine times at the end of 2018. Pro forma the conversion of our 2019 convertible notes, net debt to EBITDA was 8.4 times at the end of the first quarter. Outside of $370 million of secured debt maturing in 2021, we have no other secured debt coming due until 2023. As such, we continue to anticipate less refinancing activity in 2019 than in 2018. However, we will remain opportunistic, if attractive refinancing opportunities present themselves and we will continue to prioritize debt prepayments as part of our efforts to pursue an investment grade rating. Our liquidity at quarter end was over $1.1 billion through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facility. I’ll now cover our first quarter 2019 financial results. Core FFO per share increased 14.4% year-over-year to $0.33 primarily due to an increase in NOI and lower cash interest expense. FFO increased 17.6% year-over-year to $0.28. Last thing, I will cover is 2019 guidance. As Dallas and Charles discussed, we had a great first quarter and/or positioned well going into peak season. While we are optimistic that we will continue to perform well through peak season, we are not taking it for granted. As such, we are raising our full year 2019 same-store NOI growth guidance by 50 basis points to 4% to 5%, driven by a 50 basis point reduction in same-store core expense growth guidance to 3% to 4%. We are maintaining our same-store core revenue growth guidance of 3.8% to 4.4% in 2019. We're also raising our full year 2019 core FFO per share and AFFO per share expectations by $0.01 to $1.21 to $1.29 for core FFO and $0.99 to $1.07 for AFFO. From a timing perspective, I want to remind everyone that occupancy comps were easier at the start of 2019 than they will become as the year progresses. Regarding expenses, our efforts in the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 provided greater impact and it was contemplated in our initial guidance. We were hopeful that we could perform better than the expectations that we laid out and/or pleased that for the last two quarters we have. At the same time, I want to caution everyone that maintenance and turn volumes are typically lower in the first and fourth quarters and we would expect their seasonal pickup in the spring and summer. From a big picture perspective, we believe there is a long runway for growth ahead of us. We are not surprised with our revenue performance to start the year as fundamentals continue to favor Single Family Rental and our portfolio locations and scale provide us a differentiated advantage. We also look forward to other opportunities to create value in our business. We are excited about the rollout of ProCare across all of our markets, which should drive better resident service and additional expense efficiency. We'll also continue to stay active and recycling capital, investing in value enhancing CapEx projects and beginning to pursue ancillary service offerings to enhance our residences experience. As Dallas mentioned at the start of our call, it’s a very exciting time for Invitation Homes. With that operator, would you please open up the line for questions?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Drew Babin with Baird. Please go ahead.
Alex Barker: Good morning. This is Alex on for Drew. Looking at April leasing spreads, what markets are outperforming or on the other side underperforming your expectations. As you guys kind of get that first sneak peak at your leasing season and generally, at what rate are you guys sending out renewal notices today?
Charles Young: Yes. Hi, Alex, it’s Charles. Yes. So the West Coast has really been driving our results. You look from Seattle into California and over to Phoenix, we've had increases in Q1 on occupancy across the board. And our year-over-year renewal and new lease rates, blended rent growth is up. So all positive signs, where we've been really excited in addition to the West Tampa and Texas have shown really good results in both occupancy and rate. In Denver, it had some really good occupancy pushes as well. We're out in the low sixes in terms of our renewal ask and there's usually a spread from the asked to actual achieved.
Alex Barker: Understood. And then follow-up for Charles, on the expense front, it looks like HOA fees have you turned out pretty significantly after being stable last year. I'm sure bumps were up 20% across the board. So can you speak a little color on what's going on in that line?
Charles Young: Yes. No, good question. Look, as we finalize the integration, we realized that there was some improvement we could do in the HOA management process. And so as a result of that our accrual was off on HOA expense line. This is really attributable to the merger. It shouldn't be considered recurring. We expect this short term true-up to be resolved by the end of Q2. And the great news is today after being done with the integration and having the right process in place, we have the right personnel and we're confident that we're well positioned to manage the HOA responsibility smoothly like we did pre-merger.
Alex Barker: Perfect. And then one last quick one for Ernie. Last quarter, you talked about recurring CapEx being up about 3% this year, after really strong 1Q and obviously, I know the timing is different. Curious, if we could just get a little more color on what the cadence of CapEx spend looks like and if that 3% number is still holding true?
Ernie Freedman: Sure. Yes, we had talked about the total net cost to maintain, which is both the OpEx and CapEx. We thought we'd be up about 3% year-over-year. The great outperformance by the team in the first quarter actually has allowed us to revise those expectations that we'd expect to be more in the in the slats to 3% increased range. So definitely it should be a little bit better than we talked about a little bit earlier this year.
Alex Barker: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Ernie, just in terms of a full year core FFO guidance, predictive run rate from the first quarter, if you get to around $1.30 is slightly above the high end, you've walked through the difficult comps in terms of occupancy on same-store revenue and some of the same-store expense side. But are there any other line items that make 1Q not a good run rate for the remainder of the year?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. There’s a few things, Nick, I appreciate you’re asking the question. One, we'll see interest expense to tick up for the remainder of the year. As we disclosed in our quarterly 10-Qs, number of the swaps that we inherited in the merger were step up swaps, where it having one rate for the entire swap period. It started with a lower rate and progressed to a higher rate over the three, five, seven year term of the swap. And so a number of those swaps reset in the first half of the year. And so we do expect on a full year basis, if you were to annualize that $1.30, I would reduce that by about $0.02 just for the step up swaps, Nick. In addition, and we talked about this and there's some footnotes in our supplemental around it. Currently, the convertible notes that we have that come due July 1. Those will convert to shares at that point. We're treating those though at this point still with the debt, because we're still paying interest expense on those. But that is slightly diluted when they convert to shares in the second half of the year. That's what it costs for roughly a $0.005 on the $1.30 that you mentioned. So those two items alone bring us down to more like $1.27, $1.28. Then the other two things I point out is that, the business is a little seasonal. We do see expenses ramp up and margins decline in the third quarter. That's our peak. Certainly season for work orders, mainly around HVAC, so typically in third quarter, you'll see that historically waffle a bit lower for margin. So to annualize the first quarter for NOI would be slightly off from that. And then finally, teams are generally pretty conservative with their G&A spent in the first half of the year to save up some money for the second half of the year. So you'll see G&A ramp up a bit as we go into the second, third and fourth quarter. All those things combined would bring you down from the $1.30 number that you mentioned to something that's more than just toward the midpoint of our guidance range.
Nick Joseph: That's very helpful. Thanks. And just on the cap rate through the bulk acquisition, what was that? I think, you mentioned it was 99% occupied, but that you saw some upside for putting their homes on the Invitation Homes platform. So kind of what's a stabilized cap rate for that bulk acquisition as well?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Hi, Nick, this is Dallas. On the in-place in terms of just pricing day-one, it's kind of like a 5.7%, 5.8% depending on kind of renewals and things that are going on near term. And that I'd say that, the way to think about that is that, we've modeled that will turn about a third of that portfolio every year. And we'd see that, call it spot cap rate getting the low sixes over the next couple of years.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shirley Wu with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Shirley Wu: Good morning guys. So on the transaction side, other than bulk acquisition in 2Q, could you give us a little bit more color in terms of how you source that and what your expectations are for the rest of the 2019, while, they're going to do – continue to do more bulk acquisition or maybe like the one-off of that?
Ernie Freedman: Well, we’re certainly off to a really good start in terms of meeting our capital allocation goals for 2019. In terms of bulk, we maintain a pretty steady approach. You've seen that in the last quarter, fourth quarter of 2018, we're really active on the disposition side, or we had sold a number of portfolios. And if and when those opportunities present themselves to us, we certainly – we'll take a look both from a buy or a sell perspective. In this particular circumstance, it was a portfolio we've been familiar with for a number of years, as a competitor of ours in the market and we definitely like the footprints of both Las Vegas and Atlanta, in terms of the assets that we bought. And I would expect for us, surely through the remainder of the year, it's kind of maintain our normal guidance. I think we talked about being in somewhere between $300 million to $500 million of both buying and selling this year with kind of a net neutral focus, but we'll definitely pay attention to what comes in front of us during the summer months. There are a few smaller opportunities out there but nothing of real scale right now that would lead us to change our perspective.
Shirley Wu: Got it. And as the 30-year mortgage rate has come down more recently, do you expect that to – in fact, you move out the home buying, especially in the spring leasing season when people start to consider buying a home?
Ernie Freedman: No, in fact it's been pretty consistent. I mean we've seen some small rate volatility over the past couple of years, but more or less homeownership rates have been pretty constant between 64% and 65% for the better part of the best last couple of years, where we see some bigger shifts is in really affordability and that option to be able to lease as much more attractive than it is perhaps to own in many of our markets today. Roughly 15 of our 17 markets have pretty good dislocation in terms of the affordability factor, pushing maybe customers preferably into a leasing decision versus ownership.
Shirley Wu: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Hi everyone. How you doing? Are you planning to push rents even more aggressively in the busy spring and summer leasing season, giving your high level of occupancy? And as you guys were planning, did you consider raising revenue guidance with the other measures and why did you decide to keep it unchanged?
Charles Young: Yes. Hi. So this is Charles. I’ll answer the first question. The way that we have set our lease expiration curve is the high demand season is Q2, Q3 as families are moving. So we really set our rents based on the market and demand that's out there. From our expirations kind of mess with that, so what you'll see is a higher new lease growth in that a high demand season and that renewals will kind of stay steady and both have been really strong for us, really proud of what the teams have been doing. It's just great performance overall, given the integration as well. So that's kind of how we see the demand come to the summer on the new lease side.
Ernie Freedman: And Derek, regarding guidance, first quarter on the revenue line came in – where we expect them to be slightly ahead of expectations. We had signaled that the first quarter was going to be our easiest quarter from an occupancy comp perspective. We're not going to continue to maintain an 80 basis point increase year-over-year in occupancy like we did in the first quarter. So we had mentioned that we thought in rental rate would be up around 4% plus or minus and occupancy will be a little bit better and that was how you'd get to our guidance range of 3.8% to 4.4%. That said [Audio Dip] team kept executing as well as they are on rate as they did in the first quarter as they did in April. He went over the April numbers. That would certainly give us the opportunity to do at the midpoint or slightly better a with revenue. But we started a little bit too early in the year yet to make an adjustment on that based on where we're at currently. But we'll keep an eye on it and, and we'll see how things play out during the second quarter.
Derek Johnston: That makes sense. And just secondly on turn and churn, so can you discuss how the turn times trended in the first quarter and then how do you see churn shaking out for the rest of 2019?
Charles Young: Yes. This is Charles. So in terms of the actual turning of our homes in terms of a construction and rehab, we were in the 15 days in Q1. What you'll see though, that's a little bit of a seasonal metric as demand gets a little higher in Q2, Q3. It's trending up a little bit in April, but that's typical, but 15 days is where we want to be and we're always looking for efficiency to bring that down. In terms of churn, I think you're referring to days of re-residence, so from and move-out to move-in, we're about where we were last year in Q1, but we're seeing good trends down in April that's very positive.
Ernie Freedman: And there is really hard for us to make a bold prediction on whether turnover will continue to be down year-over-year like it's been overall. And as I was mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's at 31% on a trailing 12-month basis. That's the lowest we've seen. So it's certainly hard to predict that it go lower still, but it certainly is there is that opportunity, but though we're not in a position to make a prediction on, where that may go over in the next few quarters. But we would feel really good where it's at right now and the way we're delivering service, we certainly see the opportunity to keep turnover on the low end of the scale.
Derek Johnston: Thanks, everyone. Great stuff.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Green with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Jason Green: Good morning. Just wanted to touch on turnover a little bit more. Turnover came in very low this quarter. I was wondering, if there's anything unique about the homes that were turning over this quarter or anything that you're seeing out there that would suggest that turnover will continue to reduce as we head into the peak leasing season.
Charles Young: All right. Thanks for the question. This is Charles. Nothing special about the homes that turned, I think, as we said, the tailwinds at our back is helpful for the industry in general. But we think turnover is low because of the quality of our resident service and the quality of our homes. Teams, as I said, are really executing well. Now that we're on one platform, it's working in our favor. And Dallas mentioned earlier, affordability is also a factor. So we were really focused on what we can control and that's putting out great service and quality home.
Jason Green: And I guess in same-store expenditures coming in flat, can you quantify how much of that is really due to the fact that a 1,000 less homes turned this quarter versus the comparable quarter and how much of it is really due to increased efficiency and operations?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. Just off the top of my head, Jason, a 1,000 less turns – our turns typically run about a $1,000 of operating expense, I assume that $1,500 of operating expense. So I'd say that certainly about a 1 point, 1.5 points may have come from that. Most of it's come from the fact that the teams are just performing better. And the things that Charles talked about came through for us in today’s with regards to what we're trying to do on the R&M, so lower turnover certainly was a portion of it, but not the majority of it.
Jason Green: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Hey, good morning guys. Why don't we just follow-up with you on property taxes, late last year there's obviously a lot of discussion about property taxes and how those would be controllable going forward as the 2018 increases were one-time driven by M&A. So I wondering if you could put the 4.8% increase that we saw in 1Q in context and really what drove that?
Ernie Freedman: Sure. So we had signaled, Rich, that we expect the taxes to be up in the 5%s for the year, because we've had good home price appreciation. And we also mentioned that we thought the fourth quarter would be our best quarter because we'd had the tough comp. So we actually came in a little better than an expectation that the 4.8% and what drove that was the State of Washington actually put out some legislation that limited millage rate increases. And we weren't anticipating that. So State of Washington, we have – we're unique, we have a portfolio of about 3,500 homes in Seattle, it was a bigger good guy than we would have anticipated and that will carry through for the rest of the year. So that helped us. But I will caution everyone that, Washington is one of the few states that that comes out early. Texas does as well. The majority of what we'll find out about real estate taxes, we'll start heading in September and October, especially our bigger states like Florida, Georgia. And so we've got a ways to go, but at least the first quarter put us on a path to be about where we expected with regards to real estate taxes.
Rich Hill: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just going back to the expenses, obviously the guide implies I think 4.75% for the rest of the year. Is this – are you just trying to take a little bit of a conservative approach as you had mentioned, 2Q starts to be at the higher cost portion of the year. How should we be thinking about that?
Ernie Freedman: Yes, I think that's probably the right way to think about it, Rich. We were happy with how things have happened, but it will be our first time going through peak work order quarter season on the new systems and we want to be cautious and inappropriately, so when setting our guidance. You matched the correct math, it certainly implies that the number's going to go up. And let's be perfectly clear with everyone, we do not expect flat growth for the rest of the year. We did, we would revise guidance even through further still. We still want to make sure we're being smart about how we're looking at it and things happen. And so we want to make sure we're trying to leave some room for that as well. So we feel good about the numbers. We're certainly pleased with how the first quarter came in. And we're helping us to set ourselves up to have a successful remainder of the year with regards to expense control.
Rich Hill: Great. Thanks, Ernie. Congrats on that, really well executed quarter.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Hardik Goel: Hey guys, great quarter. Congratulations. And maybe just one for Charles, I guess. The turnover decline year-over-year was pretty significant. And I'm just wondering how much of that was intentional from you guys moving leases over the last year end to the peak leasing season to give you better pricing and how much was just organic decline?
Charles Young: Yes, I think a little bit of both. As we put the portfolios together, we were being thoughtful around that lease expiration curve. So that had some help. But look, demand is healthy, we're executing well, we got to the single platform ahead of schedule and it's paying dividends. We will continue to provide high quality service and we think over the long-haul it'll help us. You put all that together and then the teams are really doing the – what the best they can do out there. I can't thank them enough, really best-in-class. So it's a lot of execution in the field.
Hardik Goel: And just one quick follow-up on a personnel costs. There was some really good expense leverage there. What are the drivers of that? Is that – does that as seasonal as other costs? How would you think about that, because it hasn't been in the past?
Ernie Freedman: Yes, Hardik, this is Ernie. It’s almost entirely due to the merger and integration, where last year we did staffing this time of year that was full, with regards to the platform. We started seeing savings with regards to personnel and other as we rolled it further into 2018. As we gotten in 2019, we just gotten with the integration being completed and we're just about at our final staffing levels. So it's really the staffing levels that drove that from the integration.
Hardik Goel: Got it. Thanks. That's all for me.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning out there. So I guess first kudos on the great expense results in the first quarter. Charles, I guess maybe for you. I'm curious just thinking more broadly longer term beyond some of the recent benefits from the improved systems and efficiencies and the merger synergies. What do you think now? The long term expense rate for your platform is after the merger synergies run out, after you get the systems kind of to where you want them.
Charles Young: Yes. So thanks Haendel, we're really focused in on the execution that we did in Q4 and Q1. Teams put up a great cost controls with a lot of the systems that we discussed that we implemented late last year. It's added real benefit I think what's left for us to do with the implementation of ProCare to roll that out as we finish the integration and train everybody on it and get that kind of internal system and partnership with the resident going. We also have in the future fleet management, that's coming out that's going to have some benefit. So it's hard to quantify exactly what that's going to be. We've put up good numbers. We're going to continue to execute. As Ernie said, peak season is the litmus test and that's upcoming here. So hard to predict, but we're doing what we're supposed to. And what we said we were going to do and we're executing well and we're going to continue to focus.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. And not to press too much on it, but certainly a difficult question to answer, but I guess the few years back we used to think about the expense growth of this business is more or less being inflationary, some operational hiccups last year forced to rethink of that until there was fears of a higher expense projection coming into this year and certainly the guidance’s, reflecting some of the incremental costs. But is it still the view that this is inflationary and that there are factors between the clustering of your portfolio and the systems that can support that? Or should we be thinking about this as an inflation plus maybe 3%, 4% expense growth business over the long term?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. Haendel, I'll take a swing at it. This is Ernie. And I think two of the components, we've talked about it before, I think, we're not going to be much different broadly in general residential. So we’ve laid the equal of the view that residential will be inflationary plus, we probably saw that and that they think it's going to be inflationary. We're probably there are things when you see inflationary minus. I think there's two though important differentiators for us, where we are as an industry and as a company versus the broader residential community, which I talk about the multifamily. One is real estate taxes are a bigger component of our expenses, then they are in residential, because we're not a commercial product. We're residential product. We're close at 50% of our expenses come from real estate taxes and we're in the best markets when it comes to home price appreciation. So that may lend you to think that we will be a little more inflationary plus because of that. Offsetting that, I think at least for the near term, is that we're still in early stages of running as an industry and as a business. So there's opportunities for efficiencies. And Charles mentioned a couple of those around fleet management around ProCare and things like that. So at least for the near term, you'd hope to have some things there that would help offset that. But I think overall, this business has been around for hundreds and hundreds of years. There's only been institutionalized for the last few years and it's worked for folks for the last hundreds and hundreds of years to be able to operate a single family homes. And I'd like to think we can do it a little bit better with the scale that we have and the expertise that we have and the technology capabilities we have that others don't. So hopefully that all washes out to be a very similar profile that you would see in the broader residential world.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you for that and Erine, quick one while I have you. Can you talk a bit about some of the ancillary service initiatives you're pursuing here, potential impact and potential timing on revenue.
Ernie Freedman: I'm going to pass that over to Dallas, as he's – certainly, it’s been one of his big focuses, where he's sitting now.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Ernie. Hi, Haendel. A couple of things we're working on, as you know, we've done a really good job with our Smart Home implementation and adoption rates. Those adoption rates today are somewhere between 75%-plus or minus. And we're looking to enhance some of those offerings. In fact, working on some of this stuff, I wouldn't expect a lot of it to be 2019, but more 2020 type of events as you start to think about the way that we could see other income grow within our business. And there's certainly a number of other areas that would fall into kind of two buckets. One would be, things that we're currently doing, like Smart Home that we can do better and we see an opportunity in our structure around pets and some of the things that we're doing there for our residents currently. We know that roughly 50% to 60% of our residents have pets. And we think there's other offerings and things that fit into those that we're now trying to work through and to see what kind of experience we can provide it centers around some of that. We believe that's also an emotional factor for the leasing lifestyle in terms of keeping our customers longer and providing an experience that feels stickier. And so then there are other things that we're working on outside of that that are maybe newer from an ancillary perspective. Are there other ways that we can perhaps make the experience as we onboard a new resident better by using things like deposit insurance versus deposits. And there's revenue streams that are associated with those types of things. Those are a few of the examples of things that we're working on. And they are near and dear to us kind of post merger integration, so that we can start to roll these out on a unified system. And the delivery mechanisms for that how we do that is really important. So we are focused on it.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Thanks, Dallas. I appreciate that. And certainly we are looking intently on the rollout. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Buck Horne: Thanks. Good morning. Just kind of bigger picture here with the share price starting to afford you a little bit more reasonable cost of capital here. So how do you think or has your thought process around deleveraging or accelerating deleveraging changed at all with a better cost of capital here? Or are you also potentially thinking of accelerating your external growth activities is that a possibility as well? How do you think about kind of using your cost of capital more efficiently?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. Thanks, Buck. We've always talked about we'll be opportunistic when it comes to – we have opportunities to delever or opportunities to externally grow. And certainly the share price behaving better, that may give us some more opportunities. But where does the share price, it stayed still significantly under consensus NAV and where we think NAV is as well. And so to use the shares or equity to delever, that level is a difficult decision to make. And probably one, we wouldn't want to make, we want to see some better performance there. But we'll always leave all options on the table. And with regards to the external growth, we've been successful and able to fund that through capital recycling. But certainly, again, as the share price behaves, that opens up some more avenues to us. And then it's just a question of finding the right opportunities. So we're very cognitive with that, we talk to the board often about that. And we're pleased in where things have headed and we'll start to see where things play out as we go forward.
Buck Horne: That's great. And going back to the acquisition here in the second quarter. So as you're dropping in these new houses into the big existing Atlanta and Vegas footprints. So this is kind of conceptually – so obviously you're going to expect to improve the margin performance of that portfolio overtime, but does it also leverage your costs for the existing homes in the portfolio? Can you improve the existing performance of the portfolio by adding these new homes and making the markets denser?
Ernie Freedman: Yes, great question. And fundamentally you nailed it in terms of the things that we think about in terms of growing our footprint and trying to find the right size and scale. And you hear us say this over and over when we see you guys at conferences and other things, but scale really matters in this business. And so the Las Vegas, example is, one that we can talk about here briefly for a moment. As you think about our footprint there, with that acquisition, it took our Las Vegas footprint about 2,700 homes. And prior to the merger, Invitation Homes was plus or minus, say I want to say, 1,100, 1,200 homes in the Las Vegas market. And we think about the growth and the margin expansion with Las Vegas similar to what we saw in other markets like Phoenix, we started these businesses. Phoenix was a market for us, it was in the kind of the low to mid 60s. In our world today, Phoenix is a low 70s market and that comes through a couple of things. One is scale and footprint because we get more efficient. Charles and his team do a fabulous job in terms of creating efficiencies around those pods, those groups that manage a portfolio for us. And about 2,700, 2,800 homes is about the perfect size for us right now for a pod. So that makes us extremely efficient. There shouldn't be additional G&A additions with an acquisition like that. And then furthermore, your question around how does that leverage the other parts of your portfolio? Well, as Charles and the team look at efficiencies around route optimization for our maintenance techs or the way that we stock our vans with the certain types of supplies and things like that are certainly our work order and our maintenance efficiencies get much more enhanced. And then to add to that on the revenue side, anytime we have another mark in the portfolio or in the book in a market, it makes us that much more competitive to understand what our rates are doing relative to our peers.
Buck Horne: Great. Thanks, guys. Good job.
Operator: Our next question comes from Douglas Harter with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Sam Cho: Hi guys. This is actually Sam Cho filling in for Doug. So, we talked a lot about the turns and I know that turns will pick up during peak season. But, if the turnover rate stays at the current lows, could you see occupancy pushing past 97% for the portfolio on the whole.
Ernie Freedman: I think longer-term Sam, the math would tell you that would be the case, that if you could bring your days to resident down further, and we've done that in April, it's about two or three days better this year than last year and turnover stays low. You can do a quick math exercise, let's say that absolutely that on a stabilized basis, low 97% type occupancy over the course of a year is achievable. And in April we ended up at 96%, so that I would agree with that.
Sam Cho: Got it. All right. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Mike Bilerman: Hey it's Mike Bilerman. Ernie the $1.1 million of offering related expenses on Page 10 in the supplemental that you're adding back for core FFO. What are those – I guess, why is Invitation paying that when Blackstone sold $1 billion, what does that looks at in regards to?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. That's exactly what it is, because we had to file three shelves, one for Blackstone's selling it shares, one for Starwood Waypoint – Starwood Capital in case they want to do some shares and then the company has a shelf as well. And really those costs spread across all three of those. Now we aren't using our shelf today. But it is out there. If we did one issue, common equity, and that's just normal course with regards to how the shareholder agreements and things are written. And so it's about a third of a penny. In terms of cost is a onetime cost associated with it. So the Blackstone does further transactions. The only cost that would be associated with those Mike would be comfort letters and things like that and much more smaller amount of legal costs associated with future offerings. But it's standard course for the first time when you get it set up for the company, pick that up.
Mike Bilerman: And you didn't want to put that the G&A, it's just normal course of business. There's always stuff as a public company that you have, things like that to add at core FFO. I know it's a small number, but just from a methodology perspective, it just seems like, we go down this road of having alternative definitions of earnings.
Ernie Freedman: Yes, I can understand that. You kind of said what it was, it was a small amount, we want to call it out so people could see it very specifically. It's onetime and a little more expensive than usual because three shelves that'd be filed versus one that company would do in the future. And shelves you do every few years. But it's fair feedback Michael. We wanted give more disclosure and let people do with it what they thought.
Mike Bilerman: And then the perspective on Page 9 had $1.4 million. Is that just a different amount or is it relating to something else?
Ernie Freedman: No. They should be pretty consistent, Michael. So I'd have to check to see why we might ended up with an extra tens of thousands of dollars that might have rolled in separate from that, that were also in that line, but I don't have an accounting for that on top of my head.
Mike Bilerman: And then you're comment on NAV. You made the comment that Street consensus and maybe these are – I think you said significantly or much, but it was indicating that there was a lot higher than where the stock's trading. SNL's got your NAV at $24.34 in facts that's got an at $25.64 stocks at $25.20. So it's not, I guess it's in the range of where the Street sort of thing it's worth. So I just wanted to sort of follow-up a little bit on that comment about using your equity to accelerate and deleveraging program or to fund external growth.
Ernie Freedman: Yes. And so I'm pleased to hear that it's doing so well this morning. We've been preparing for the call, so I haven't been paying attention to the fact that it's gone up from this morning. So that's good to see. But I say Michael is and we actually pulled the analyst models and I don't think everyone reports into those numbers and we can get to a number that's closer to 26.5% for what the analysts set out there. So I'm calling that consensus, understanding other people to different consensus numbers. Regardless, we have a different view on where NAV and we haven't disclosed NAV since our IPO. Yes, it's just like any other public company. We'll use that as a source for capital for us. On the deleveraging side, we have a very state balance sheet today. We'd like to get to investment grade faster if we could. We weren't going to do that by diluting current shareholders. We don't have that need, that requirement. But certainly, it's a like – it's a preference to get to investment grade as fast as we can. And we'll keep that option open for us if the stock price continues to perform and do better. And then regardless, Dallas and Charles come from very acquisitive backgrounds. They both worked in the private world and you've seen what they were able to build in the predecessor companies and we've done here. So we'll certainly look very carefully at what our best cost of capital for us, if we found the right external growth opportunities, Michael. So I'd like to thank management and everyone, board is align line with all of our shareholders and we want to get accomplished there.
Mike Bilerman: And just remind me in terms of processes, Blackstone came and wanted to do another secondary offering of their shares. And you could tag along with that in terms of issuing primary. Do you have the ability and then knock and be melt down or more to just like a pure negotiation with them about what the right sizing of a total offering is? Let's say they came said, we want to do $1 billion. You don't think you can put $1 billion into the market. You want to do $500 million? What's the – is it preset in terms of methodology or it has to be negotiated?
Ernie Freedman: Well, I say it's different things. So anytime that the company is thinking about issuing equity, Michael, it's a decision of our board. So management will go to the Board of Directors and say whatever reason, whether Blackstone is potentially selling at that point, Starwood selling that point or anyone else. We think there's an opportunity for us to issue equities and/or at other times we'd have engaged in discussion with our Board before what we thought was right for the company. And Blackstone, you'd have to ask Blackstone with regards to how they're choosing – to set how much they want to sell, when they want to sell and things like that. We're certainly are privy to that. And if there's opportunity for us to be efficient and do it all at the same time, then we would get together and do what makes the most sense for the shareholders to get that accomplished. Blackstone first and foremost, is focused on what makes sense for the shareholders. And they certainly, made their intentions known and what they want to do, but they also have – as you know, Michael, a lot of shares to sell and they want to make sure they're doing that in the smartest way as they've demonstrated with the other platform companies. And today they've demonstrated with Invitation Homes. So I'd expect nothing less than that going forward.
Mike Bilerman: Okay. Thanks for all the color Ernie. Appreciate it.
Ernie Freedman: Michael, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Dallas, on the dispositions in this quarter and in recent quarters, could you share what NOI growth for these homes, these lower quality homes would look like over the next several years if you're still operating them?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. It's a little bit of a tricky question, John in terms of what we've sold, I have to go back and look and where in some. The NOI growth probably more or less is kind of along the lines of what you'd see from the company. Maybe a little bit less. And that's one of the reasons why we might be selling some of these homes. Remember, we do sell for reasons outside of just – I mean, obviously NOI growth is key and something that we focused on. We want to make sure that the homes in our portfolio long-term are ones that are going to provide some of the best risk adjusted returns to shareholders. What we typically been doing so far through the first four months of the year and much of like what you saw in fourth quarter is we've been selling homes that are either A, an outlier geography or parts of the portfolio that just really inefficient for us to manage. B, homes that are either suboptimal in nature because of finish, potential CapEx risk down the road or C, we've been selling homes that had been bigger too. We have homes in our footprints that are too big from a square footage standpoint. And so if you look at the types of homes that we're typically buying, our sweet spots kind of between 1,600 and 2,200 square feet, 2,300 square feet. And so for those variety of reasons, we might be a net seller and typically we see lower growth coming out of some of those homes.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Then if NOI growth is not maybe a bit lower, could you share how much higher their all-in cost to maintain is?
Dallas Tanner: It would vary again to my earlier points around square footages and geographies. We have different fit and finish standards. For example, in a home like Seattle where we might put down vinyl plank flooring every time. And so if a homework coming through our asset management review in that market, we would certainly take into consideration some of those longer-term CapEx needs that home might need. Whereas maybe a home in one of our warmer Southwest markets may have a little bit different CapEx approach and our margins may be better. So we may be inclined to keep that home a bit longer. It all goes into kind of the cycle of how we do our rebuy analysis on a home by home basis.
John Pawlowski: Okay. On the portfolio acquisition. I understand the margin benefits. Could you share how far below you think the market rents were versus market?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. I think, to just high single digits from a rent perspective, in terms of where we think there's immediate turn on these rents as they renew. And then also kind of going in price. As I mentioned earlier, being kind of 5.7, 5.8 on an in place cap raise is much higher than we typically are able to see in that marketplace. Vegas is a hard market to buy in. So we're actually thrilled with our ability to buy this type of portfolio.
Charles Young: Yes, John. I'd say, if you look at our supplementals you've seen Vegas has really ramped up in terms of new lease growth rates in the last year for us. And the vast proportion of the portfolio was in Vegas. So just the embedded lost the lease in the portfolio is higher than we would typically see in our portfolio. So between that and then the fact they were running at a very high occupancy, so we don't think they were pushing as much as we might have chosen to do. And they were choosing to run the business a little bit differently. It gives us confidence that we've got potentially an opportunity for some rent bumps on that portfolio as leases turn.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Then one final one for me. Charles, could you share the bad debt trends year-over-year? And any notable outliers by markets either downward or upward inflection points in bad debt?
Ernie Freedman: I'll answer that one, John it's Ernie. We've actually see bad trends are consistent year-over-year within a few basis points and we haven't seen any outliers in any markets positive or negative. It's all been relatively consistent on a year-over-year basis.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Thanks for taking all the questions.
Operator: Our next question is from Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please go ahead.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks very much. Just thinking about the cadence of turnover and new lease activity. Do you expect occupancy to dip in June sequentially?
Charles Young: Yes. Typically we'll see occupancy go down in Q2, Q3 as we talked about the turnover of volume. So we do think that April, while we came in high, as we go deeper into the summer, we're going to see that occupancy number trend down.
Jade Rahmani: Thank you. Secondly, have you sold any assets to iBuyer such as Zillow or Opendoor? And if so, could you quantify the percentage?
Charles Young: To date, we really haven't sold much through the iBuyer platforms. It's something we certainly considered Jade, it's a good question. We've been more of an acquire of properties I should say, through the iBuyer platforms. But we certainly look at it as another form for us to be able to transact. And as they develop their systems get a bit more robust and a bit more user friendly, you could certainly anticipate they were especially on some of our vacant or end user sales that we might choose to sell through some of those platforms.
Jade Rahmani: And just lastly, in terms of home purchase trends, are you seeing any change in the percentage of move out to the buy? Has that declined notably on a year-over-year basis?
Charles Young: On a year-over-year basis just up, just a bit. Not much more than anything that's been normal. Typically been between 22% and 25% of our move outs. And it's still kind of right in that range depending on the month and the quarter.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks very much.
Charles Young: Thanks, Jade.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hi guys. A quick question on the renewals. So it's like supply and demand is quite favorable especially compared to last year. Is there anything holding you back from pushing more on the renewals? Do you have any internal governor?
Dallas Tanner: Really like we said before, really set by market and we look at a number of factors that determine what that price will be. We'll go out with healthy assets as we talked about in the low 6's. But we want to find that right balance between keeping occupancy and minimizing turnover. And our revenue management teams working with the field teams do a great job of finding that right balance. So market sets it. And also we – it's our performance on the resident customer service that we're providing and do they want to stay with us and we'd been doing better and better as our teams are really focused on making sure we create a great resident experience. And so demand is looking good for us.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then one quick one on the acquisition – the bulk acquisition. You mentioned about the rental uplift, but you imagine there's quite a bit of a difference on the margin between your existing portfolio in the market and in which you bought. Do you know that off hand? And then would you expect to close most of that in the first year by just plugging it into your platform?
Dallas Tanner: When we underwrote, we expected the revenues to be – we didn't really dig into the expense history so much on their side. We just, when we model a bulk acquisition, we'll look to see what's happening from an R&M perspective on that portfolio. But we'll run it through our model Wes, with regards, we expect margins to be. That said, based on – we're in the cap rate, we came out for us. We think it was a win-win, it was a win for the sellers for where they could run the portfolio, I think they got a fair price and they were clearly pleased with that otherwise we wouldn't have moved forward. On the flip side, we think it's a win for us because it was a little bit of a different model in terms of how we want to run the revenue side, what we would do on the expense side. So whether we have an uplift or not from where they are. We're comfortable with that we'll get this to our margins. And as we talked about earlier, especially in a market like Vegas, we increased our footprint by almost 10%, allow us to run even more efficiently across the entire footprint of Las Vegas. Not so much with Atlanta, with only a couple of them – only about 100 homes, we buy in Atlanta with 12,000 it was a little unhappy, will have much of a difference there, but certainly allows us in one of the best markets today and one of the fastest growing market today Vegas to increase our footprint and improve the margins across the whole portfolio in Vegas.
Wes Golladay: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks for joining us today. We appreciate everyone's interest in Invitation Homes. We're excited about where we are today with our business and the opportunities in front of us. And we look forward to seeing everyone, hopefully at NAREIT in June. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-15 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Invitation Homes Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Greg Van Winkle, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dallas Tanner.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you, Greg. We are excited to report a strong finish to 2018 and favorable momentum into 2019. Our location, scale and platform continue to create a best in class experience for our residents, evidenced by our industry leading resident turnover rates, blended rent growth has accelerated for each of the past three months to levels significantly higher than last year and solid occupancy positions as well to continue capturing acceleration in the 2019 peak leasing season. We are also driving better efficiency on the R&M side of our business which resulted in fourth quarter performance that exceeded our guidance. Our strong finish to the year brought core FFO per share growth for the full year 2018 to 14%. Before discussing what this momentum may translate to in 2019. I want to take a moment to review our performance on the 2018 operational priorities that we communicated to you at the beginning of the year. Our first objective was to deliver strong, consistent operational results across our core portfolio. We met our expectations for the top line with 4.5% same store core revenue growth, which outpaced residential peers. However we can execute better on the expense side of the business. After identifying opportunities to be more efficient with repairs and maintenance last summer, our teams have done a great job of starting to capture some of these opportunities. We have more work to do but are pleased with how our performance improved in the second half of 2018. Our next objective was to further enhance the quality of service we provide to our residents. The ultimate scorecard on service comes when it's time for residents to make a renewal decision and we are thrilled that our turnover rate on a trailing 12-month basis improved each quarter in 2018 to new all-time lows. Our third operational priority was to execute on our integration plan. In addition to finding an incremental $5 million of projected end-stage synergies, we also beat expectations for 2018 achievement by capturing $46 million of annualized run rate synergies in the year. With respect to investments, our priority was to continue increasing the quality of our portfolio by recycling capital. In total in 2018, we sold roughly $500 million of primarily lower rent band homes that no longer fit our long-term strategy. We recycled capital from dispositions into both the purchase of almost $300 million of homes in more attractive sub markets with higher expected total returns and prepayments of debt. Finally, we made progress on our path to an investment grade balance sheet. We reduced net debt to adjusted EBITDA to below 9 times, compared to approximately 11 times that our IPO in early 2017. We also improved our weighted average maturity and cost to debt. Looking ahead to 2019, we are excited about our opportunity for growth. Let me address these three opportunities in particular. Revenue growth, expense controls, and capital allocation. With respect to revenue growth, fundamentals are as strong as they've ever been for single family rental. In our markets, household formation in 2019 are forecast to grow at almost 2% or 90% greater than the U.S. average. Construction of new single family homes is not keeping pace with this demand and has recently slowed further. In addition, affordability has become a bigger challenge for potential homebuyers due to a combination of home price appreciation and higher mortgage rates, compared to last year. We are seeing this play out in our portfolio today with same-store move-outs to homeownership down 17% year-over-year in 2018 Leading housing economist John Burns estimates that the cost to rent a single family home is lower than the cost to own a comparable home in 15 of our 17 markets today by an average discount of 16%. We believe our product provides an attractive solution for customers who want to live in a high-quality, single-family home without making the financial commitment of homeownership. Furthermore, we believe the location of our homes in attractive neighborhoods close to jobs and great schools and the high touch service we provide differentiate Invitation Homes and make the choice to lease with us even more compelling. Regardless of what the broader economy may bring in the coming years, we feel that our business is well-positioned. Even if we were to experience a cooling of the economy, our portfolio could continue to benefit from demographics that are shifting more and more in our favor and from a sticky single-family resident base that would likely find homeownership incrementally less attractive under more challenging economic conditions. We are also excited about our opportunity on the expense side of the business and are focused in 2019 on adding to the progress we made in the second half of 2018, newly implemented changes to our repairs and maintenance workflow and route optimization systems are paying dividends already. But we still have plenty of opportunity to be more efficient. We also believe the integration of our field teams and property management platform in 2019 will be a positive catalyst for expense improvement. With one team operating on one platform, we will be better position to find new ways to refine our business and take residence service to higher levels. With respect to capital allocation, our plan in 2019 remains focused on the dual objective of refining our portfolio and reducing leverage on our balance sheet. The markets we are in remain healthy, providing compelling opportunities on both the acquisition and disposition sides for us to achieve our capital recycling goals abundant capital from potential buyers and limited inventory in our markets create an attractive opportunity for us to prune our portfolio. We also have multiple uses for these proceeds including buying homes in more attractive submarkets, reinvesting in our portfolio through value enhancing CapEx and prepaying down debt. Before we move on I want to say a few quick words about our team. It is a thrill to have the opportunity to leave the company I founded with my partners, a company that is full of talented people from top to bottom. I'm fortunate to be stepping into the CEO role with the company in an outstanding place. Thanks in part to the leadership of Fred Tuomi. Fred helped to guide Invitation Homes through what has been a very successful merger and integration. This positions us to move forward better than we've ever been before. We thank Fred for his leadership and wish him the absolute best. Moving forward, we will continue to stay true to our DNA and the strategic path we've been on since day one. We'll put residents first. We'll drive organic growth and an outstanding living experience by leveraging our competitive advantage of location, scale and high touch service. We will be opportunistic with respect to external growth. We'll progress toward an investment grade balance sheet and we will do all of this with the best team in the business. I am fortunate to be surrounded by true experts and industry pioneers on our field and corporate teams as well as in our board room. To all of our associates, thank you for a great finish to 2018 and let's continue to build on our momentum in 2019. With that, I'll turn it over to Charles Young, our Chief Operating Officer to provide more detail on our fourth quarter operating results.
Charles Young: Thank you. As Dallas said the fourth quarter of 2018 was a great one for us operationally. Our teams did a fantastic job capturing rent growth and occupancy to put us in a strong position going into 2019 drove better R&M efficiency resulting in outperformance of our guidance in the fourth quarter. And most importantly, we continue to provide outstanding resident service. I'll now walk you through our fourth quarter operating results in more detail. Same store core revenues in the fourth quarter grew 4.6% year-over-year. This increase was driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 3.8% and 70 basis point increase in average occupancy to 96% for the quarter. Same store core expense growth in the fourth quarter was better than expected. Core controllable costs are down slightly year-over-year even with a tough R&M comparison versus the fourth quarter of 2017 due to that year's hurricanes. Property taxes increased 15.1% year-over-year in line with our expectations due to the timing items discussed on last quarter's call. As a result, overall same store expense growth was 7.4% year-over-year. This brought our fourth quarter 2018 same store growth to 3.2%. For the full year 2018, same store NOI growth was 4.4%, 66 basis points ahead of the midpoint of guidance provided on our last earnings call. Importantly, we have made steady progress on improving our R&M efficiency by implementing numerous changes to systems and processes after opportunities for improvement were identified. With these changes we have improved how work orders are allocated between in-house technicians and third parties. Our corresponding service trips are scheduled and the routes that technicians follow to optimize their time. In the fourth quarter, we also rolled out an important update to our technology platform that enabled all of our internal technicians to perform work on any home in our portfolio not just the homes associated with our legacy organization. This made a material difference in the productivity of our maintenance technicians in the fourth quarter. We still have work to though and we'll continue implementing process improvements and ProCare enhancements in the months leading up to 2019 peak service season. Next, I'll provide an update on integration of our field teams. After successful results in the testing phase, we began market implementation of our unified operating platform in November. As of today, we have teams in five markets, representing almost 40% of our homes functioning under our go forward structure and platform. Transitions have been smooth and feedback from the field teams have been extremely positive. We plan to roll out the platform to our remaining markets in waves over the next several months. This rollout is expected to unlock the remainder of the $50 million to $55 million of total run rate synergies we have guided to by mid-2019. As of year-end 2018, our run rate synergy achievement was $46 million. Next, I'll cover leasing trends in the fourth quarter of 2018 and January 2019. Fundamentals in our markets remain as strong as ever and we're executing well. Both renewal rent growth and new lease rent growth have increased sequentially in each of the last three months. Renewals average 4.7% in the fourth quarter 2018 and new leases average 2.1%. Notably new lease rent growth is now exceeding prior year levels and was a full 70 basis points ahead of last year in the fourth quarter of 2018. This resulted in blended rent growth of 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018 of 20 basis points year-over-year. Same time resident turnover continue to decrease driving occupancy to 96% in the fourth quarter of 2018, up 70 basis points year-over-year. Each of these leasing metrics improved further in January. Lender rent growth average 4.3% in January 2019, up 90 basis points year-over-year and occupancy average 96.2% in January 2019also up 90 basis points year-over-year. The fundamental tailwinds that are back in occupancy in a strong position we are confident as we start to New Year. Our field teams are focused on execution and are excited to leverage our integrated platform to deliver even more efficient resident service. With that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Ernie Freedman.
Ernest Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today, I will cover the following topics, balance sheet and capital markets activity, financial results for the fourth quarter and 2019 guidance. First, I'll cover the balance sheet and capital markets activity where we had a very active and successful year. Let me start with a few highlights about where we started 2018 versus where we ended it. Net debt $9.1 billion to start the year, $8.8 billion to end the year. Net debt to EBITDA 9.5 times to start the year, 8.8 times to end the year pro forma in the conversion of our 2019 convertible notes. Weighted average years to maturity 4.1 to start the year, 5.5 to end the year. Unencumbered homes 42% of homes to start the year, 48% to end the year in weighted average interest rate 3.4% to start the year, 3.3% to end the year in a rising rate environment. We accomplished all this by prioritizing free cash flow in both disposition proceeds for debt prepayment and by refinancing debt in 2018 with $4.2 billion of proceeds from our four new securitizations. While we remain opportunistic, we anticipate less refinancing activity in 2019 with no secured debt maturing in 2019 or 2020 in only $373 million maturing in 2021. However, we will continue to prioritize debt prepayments as part of our efforts to pursue an investment grade rating and have made incremental progress already with the prepayment of $70 million of secured debt in January. We will continue our deleveraging strategy by electing to settle conversions of our $230 million of 2019 convertible notes in common shares. We view this decision as a way to reduce net debt to EBITDA by approximately 0.25 turns while incurring minimal incremental dilution to core FFO per share. Our liquidity at quarter end was over $1.1 billion through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facility. I'll now cover our fourth quarter 2018 financial results. Core FFO and AFFO per share for the fourth quarter increased year over year to $0.30 and $0.25 respectively. Primary drivers of the increases were growth in NOI and lower cash interest expense per share. For the full year of 2018, core FFO and AFFO per share increased 13.7% and 8.1% respectively. As a result of our anticipated growth in AFFO per share in 2019, we've increased our quarterly dividend to $0.13 from $0.11 per share. We continue to target a low dividend payout ratio as we believe a beneficial use of cash is to further pay down debt. The last thing I will cover is 2019 guidance. As Dallas and Charles discussed, we believe that we continue to have strong fundamental tailwinds at our back and entered the year from a strong occupancy position with accelerating rate growth. As such we expect to grow same store revenue by 3.8% to 4.4% in 2019. Home price appreciation in our markets over the last year or two suggest that growth in real estate taxes in2019 is likely to remain elevated, albeit lower than the growth we saw in 2018. As a result, we expect overall same-store core expense growth to moderate from 2018 levels to 3.5% to 4.5% in 2019. Core controllable expenses are likely to grow less than that as we believe we have positioned ourselves to better control R&M cost in 2019, but we still have work to do. This brings our expectation for same-store NOI growth to 3.5% to 4.5%. Full year 2019 core FFO per share is expected to be $1.20 to $1.28 and AFFO per share is expected to be $0.98 to $1.06, representing year-over-year increases of greater than 5% and 7% at the midpoints respectively. Primary driver of these expected increases its growth in same-store NOI. Lower property management and G&A expenses and lower interest expense are also expected to contribute to growth. A detailed bridge of our 2018 core FFO per share to the midpoint of 2019 core FFO per share guidance can be found in our earnings release. There are a handful of items likely to impact the progression of same-store growth in core FFO and AFFO growth from a timing perspective over the course of the year. With respect to revenue growth, occupancy comps are easier at the start of the - at the start of the year versus later. Regarding expenses, core expense growth is likely to be highest in the first quarter. First while we have made great progress addressing items related to our integrated R&M system that drove inefficiency in 2018, we still have work to complete as part of our plan. We do not expect to be fully optimized in the first quarter of 2019. Second, as we discussed last year, other income and resident recoveries in the first quarter of 2018 were higher than normal as a result of post-merger alignment of the resident utility bill back timing across the two legacy companies. This will create a more difficult comparison for core expense growth in the first quarter of 2019. These two items are expected to more than offset the favorable impact of comping against a period in the first quarter of 2018 with higher than normal work order volume as a result of 2017's hurricanes. Also regarding expenses the year over year increase in real estate taxes is likely to be materially lower in the fourth quarter of 2019 than in the first three quarters of the year. As discussed previously we booked an unfavorable Real Estate Tax catch up in the fourth quarter of 2018 for tax assessments that came in higher than expected, this creates an easier comp for the fourth quarter of 2019. Finally the 2019 convertible notes are expected to convert to common shares on July 1 of 2019. This will impact the interest expense and share count used to calculate core FFO and AFFO per share by treating the notes as debt for the first half of 2019 and is equity for the second half of 2019 assuming that the notes convert as expected I'll wrap up by reiterating how much we are looking forward to 2019. Fundamentals are in our favor and we have multiple levers we believe we can pull to create value. We're excited to move on to one platform across the entire organization and to execute on that platform to deliver outstanding results to both our residents and our shareholders. With that operator would you please open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: As you roll up unified operating platform across the portfolio, what lessons have you learned from the process and are you making any adjustments for the other markets based off of them?
Charles Young: This is Charles. We've made really good progress in implementing the combined portfolio rollout. We've as I said in my remarks we've implemented about five markets which equals about 40% of our total homes. We've been really thoughtful based on what we learned in 2018 that we've taken really measured pace and how we roll it out. We expect to be done around 2019. We made a decision to implement in the slower time of the year which is working in our favor more careful also around the timing and which we roll it out during the month to make sure that we're not impacting the field teams. We went through multiple rounds of testing to make sure that things were working as expected before we went in. We have great training, we've learned from each of the rollouts to get better in our training and implementation has been great. The feedback from our field teams have been very positive. And as I've said we expect that we'll be there by mid-year. Bottom line is the teams are really excited to get one combined platform because they were working in multiple systems before so we see this as a really positive thing.
Nick Joseph: And Dallas, congratulations on the promotion. When you took over as Interim President in August, the board formed a special committee to work with you and the team during Fred's absence. Is that committee still in place and what's the board's will today?
Dallas Tanner: Thanks for the question and excuse me the compliment. Yeah. The board is still functioning in a similar fashion as we were in that executive committee will stay in place through 2019. As you guys know we have a very supportive board with the ton of excellent experience behind it. So we'll continue to use that it's been strategic for us as we've embedded out some these things that Charles just discussed in terms of how we would integrate going forward and we talked through some of the process so they've beenvery supportive in that capacity and we would anticipate them to continue doing so.
Operator: The next question will be from Drew Babin of Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: As it pertains to AFFO guidance, most of it, can you talk about the direction of recurring CapEx per home on - in 2019, understanding that in 2018 with the Starwood Waypoint merger there might have been a little bit of noise there. Can you just give us a little more color on the trends in that number as well as how you think about our revenue enhancing CapEx this year?
Ernest Freedman: Drew, this is Ernie. With regards specifically to our recurring CapEx, we expect overall net cost to maintain which is both our operating expenses associated with repairs and maintenance as well as turnover - as well as the capital associated with it and that would be our recurring CapEx. Maybe we think that's going to be up you know approximately about 3% year-over-year. We definitely have some easier comps to go up against in and we certainly had some improvements but as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we're not fully optimized today. And of course we want to be cautious before we get into peak leasing season, before we getting too far ahead of ourselves where things may end up, where we sit today and where we're at with the progress you made. We feel like we're back to a more normal type growth rate with the opportunity to maybe do better as we go forward. So you know I would expect plus or minus in the 3% range for net costs to maintain to grow. And Drew, remind me with what the second part of your question was?
Drew Babin: As revenue enhancing CapEx, whether we can expect any kind of directional change from last year there?
Dallas Tanner: Drew, this is Dallas. I'll answer this. We'll continue to expect our focus to continue to find ways to optimize these assets on a like-for-like basis as they turn. Now some of that allows us these opportunities with revenue enhancing CapEx, I would expect that program to continue to develop. If not you know maybe be a little bit more active as we spread into some more West Coast markets. We certainly see a number of different opportunities outside of just the smart home functionality Some of our West coast markets. We certainly see a number of different opportunities outside of just the Smart Home functionality with which we're continually adding into the portfolio today we're finding that our customers they're sticky by nature. But what's been really interesting over the past year as we've piloted revenue enhancing CapEx and gotten better at how we implement that process is how many times our customers on a renewal or on a new lease want to actually pay up to optimize parts or sections of their house. This is a win for both us and the customer because we're able to harden the asset in the area and also get a better risk adjusted return on the revenue increase and that's outside of the way we would normally underwrite a property so expect us to do more of it. We're looking and getting smarter, Charles and team have done a terrific job on the procurement side to find ways that we can continually enhance that experience for the customer.
Drew Babin: And then lastly just on the guidance expectations non-cash interest and share based comp I was hoping you kind of give us those numbers just given the accounting kind of how those play into the core FFO calculation.
Dallas Tanner: Drew we have not provided guidance for those in the past. So let me think about what we can do and get something out there for folks to help with modeling but don't have anything I can share with that with you today.
Operator: And the next question will be from Douglas Harter of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harter: I was just hoping you could talk about where you are in the process of optimizing the portfolio and kind of how you think about the home count as we move through 2019.
Dallas Tanner: We've been pretty vocal about our desire to continually refine and optimize the portfolio and the nice thing about the merger is we've had enough time and distance. We knew there were some homes initially both with which we wanted to sell and also some areas where we wanted to scale up and could find and drive greater efficiencies in the portfolio by acquiring, we expected to do more of the same. We had a pretty busy year in terms of what we were selling and it comes in a variety of shapes and sizes to why we sold. We certainly were active in parts of Florida where we now on a combined basis had over 25,000 homes post-merger expect us to continually look for areas like that where we can continue to refine the portfolio, create efficiencies for the operating teams and build on the scale and density that we have in those markets. In addition, we also had outlier locations or geographies where we'll - at times or seasons look for ways to refine and improve the way that those parts of the portfolio is behaving. And lastly I just add there are occasions and we're starting to see this a little bit in some of our West Coast properties where if a home just becomes too valuable and ultimately we think it's better suited for an end user, we'll sell that home and take those gains and recycle capital into parts of markets where we see still significant opportunities for good risk adjusted return.
Douglas Harter: Just following up on that, what are the markets where you see the best opportunities to kind of recycle capital into?
Dallas Tanner: Well, you know funny enough we were pretty active in 2018 and still a lot of West Coast markets, we've been pretty vocal about the fact that we love Seattle, we love the growth that's going on there. It's evidenced in some of the new lease and renewal rates that we're seeing in the business today. We also still are finding really good opportunities in the southeast. And if we could, we'd buy more in California and markets if those opportunities were available to us. We just see limited supply in today's environment. As we've stated household formation in our markets today is almost 2 times that the national average and we're feeling that in the parts of our business specifically around new lease growth and renewals. But generally speaking you've seen that we've been getting out of parts of the Midwest over time and we've continued to recycle coastal where the majority of our footprints are today.
Operator: The next question will be from Shirley Wu of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Shirley Wu: So in your expense guidance a 4%, do you think you could break out like different pockets in terms of growth for personnel or R&M for 2019?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Really what we're comfortable providing today is because taxes are almost half of our expense number, I can provide some - some guidance around what we think is going to happen with taxes and what's going to happen for everything else, which is the very rough to the other half, and I think as everyone knows home price appreciation continues to be pretty strong in our markets and it is run over 6% across the board on a weighted average basis across our markets. And with that when we do expect that property taxes in 2019, it will be up somewhere in the 5%s for us. And of course Prop 13 in California helps to mute that a little bit for us with having 20% of our portfolio in California. So the real estate taxes being up, we think somewhere in the 5%s. We think everything else will be less than 3% to get to our - at the midpoint to get to our guidance range of 3.5% to 4.5% and as the year plays out as different things are we'll see some - some things flow through on those other expense items. But from a guidance perspective that we're comfortable providing guidance in that way, Shirley.
Shirley Wu: So off of recently mortgage rates have really pulled back especially in the last couple of months. But your move-out to home buying has - still has continued shut down. Is that something that you're concerned about or moving forward how do you think about that?
Dallas Tanner: Well, we're certainly not concerned about it because it's been fairly consistent over the past couple of years. Less than 10% of our overall portfolio on an annual basis moves out of our - our business to go buy a home at least that's what we've seen over the first few years as a public company. We look at it you know a couple of ways I mentioned in my earlier comments, we are seeing a real shift my earlier comments. We are seeing a real shift in terms of affordability to your point. And we're picking up some of the net benefit of that quite frankly in our business today. As we mentioned before, 15 of our 17 markets based on the research that we look at and follow are now more affordable to lease, and call it an entry level product than it is to buy in today's environment. So we're - we think interest rates there actually maybe push people into a longer term lease with us, or maybe offer an opportunity for consideration to choose the leasing lifestyle. And there's some markets to your point that are a bit more dislocated. I mean in Seattle, Washington for example, that differential can be as high as 30%. I mean, so we look at that as also an opportunity to make sure that we're providing a best in class service and an experience that people are willing to pay for. We'd look at that as an opportunity.
Operator: The next question will be from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Can you discuss how turn times trended in 4Q, and where do you like to see them in 2019? And really if the R&M platform drives any benefit there?
Charles Young: Yes. This is Charles. Turn times have been kind of mid-teens for us, and we'd like to bring that down. Again we've been consolidating the teams, the offices and the platforms as we get all into one platform as we talked about and finalize that integration at the first half of the year here, I think we'll be in a much better shape to bring those times down. As we think around turn, that really is the kind of quality and location of our homes and we make sure that we are delivering a high quality product, that delivery of product will relate to the R&M in terms of any work orders that may come afterwards. Part of what we want to implement in 2018 that's important is our ProCare service and that's a follow on after the turn when the resident moves into make sure that they understand their responsibility, but also we bundle some of those work orders to a 45-day visit that will allow us to kind of manage that process with the resident on the R&M side. So that's where the overlap in the transition happens, but ultimately there are two separate portions of the business. And as I've said, we'd like to bring those turn times down and we expect that we'll start getting into the low teens as we get a consolidated.
Derek Johnston: And last one for me. How many customers are now subscribed to the Smart Tech technology and what other ancillary income drivers have you guys identified?
Charles Young: So, right now we have about a third of our homes have the Smart Home installed, so a little over 30,000 about half of those are paying customers and that builds every time that we move a resident in 70% to 80% of those residents are opting into the service which is great adoption rate. In terms of other ancillary with the integration we've really been focusing on finalizing that, but once we get through the integration, we see there's opportunities whether it's in moving services or pet services, pest control items that we can think around filters, there are a number of items that we want to attack, but right now we're focused in on making sure that we finalize the integration.
Operator: The next question will be from Richard Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Richard Hill: I wanted to just ask maybe a couple of questions about how you think about 2019 where you didn't give guidance, you had some success with bulk sales. So Dallas I'm wondering if you can give us any sort of color around those bulk sales cap rates lack of buyers? And then do you think that's going to continue in 2019 or how we supposed to think about that going forward?
Dallas Tanner: A number of things there is I mentioned earlier in my comments, we still see a quite a bit of demand in the marketplace for stabilized products being sold from an institutional operator like ourselves. So I would expect that we'll still explore some bulk opportunities this year and really quite frankly any year where our scale and density allow us to facilitate those types of transactions. In terms of what we did in 2018, we sold homes on average that were much cheaper than the homes that we were acquiring. I think if you look at the fourth quarter as an example, in the 1,600 plus homes we sold in Q4, we hadn't call it an average price per home around 175,000. We are recycling that money into homes that were well north of 300,000 on a per property basis. So, if you think about what those cap rates are, you certainly - when you're selling cheaper product generally on a pro forma basis, you're going to see cap rates that are a little bit higher just because your denominator being so low in terms of your asset price - pricing. And so, what we sold over the majority of 2018 were homes that were closer to six cap and recycling the homes that were well within the mid fives. Now that doesn't tell you the whole story. As you think about the way we've recycled in terms of what we bought and what we sold, on average we're buying homes that we're renting for about $500 more or less more than the homes that we were selling. So that additional $6,000 in revenue is a really smart way to operate on the long-term when you think about all the incremental cost that can go into this business.
Richard Hill: You guys put up a really impressive margin number this quarter. So, how are we thinking about that sort of near- term and long-term? So I guess the question is, is that 65% plus margin. Is that sustainable near-term and do you think you can still get that into the high 60s. I'm going to push it to 70 area. What are you thinking about there.
Dallas Tanner: I think the answer is that it really all depends on how things move forward with some capital allocation and other things. If you recall as you know fourth quarter and first quarter typically are our highest margin quarters but for the entire year of 2018 and year we certainly have some challenges. We put up a 64.5% margin which we were pleased to do even with the challenges we had and as we continue to refine the portfolio from a capital allocation perspective importantly and as Charles continues to refine what he's doing on operating standpoint and our guidance implies that the margins will be pretty similar from 2018 to 2019 based on what's put out there for a midpoint of revenue, expense and NOI guidance We think there's opportunity for that to continue to increase. Some are certainly in the higher 60s. We do have I think a half dozen markets today that are in the 70s and certainly as Dallas looks to do some things on the capital allocation side, and especially that the homes we're selling out of and some of the markets where we've been disproportionally selling. You know those markets do have lower margins so you could certainly see, you could force your way to a 70% type margin. But I think for where we're at where we want to have our homes in the portfolio I think increasing it by a few hundred basis points from where it is now into the higher 60s is certainly a very achievable goal over the next period of time.
Richard Hill: And just one final question Dallas going back to your prepared remarks on affordability, when you think about affordability are you sort of doing an apples to apples rent to mortgage payment or do you guys think about affordability relative to the cost of lending to your home differently.
Dallas Tanner: I think we like to look at it a couple of different ways. I think the way to really look at it and so that you keep everything constant and as you got to think about housing costs as not only your mortgage but also some ongoing maintenance expense that a normal homeowner would incur over ordinary course. And that's the way Burns and a number of other economists tend to look at it. We look at a couple of different pieces we've done some of our own research obviously with the data that we have and you're certainly seeing that dislocation we talked about earlier. Now there's a time and season with that your friend and there's a time and season where maybe it isn't, but right now it certainly feels like we're positioned to capture some of that affordability demand that people are looking for some relief specifically in the West Coast where we're seeing rising home prices as well as the rising rate environment not helping the homeownership story.
Operator: The next question will be from Jason Green of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Jason Green: On the deceleration in the same store revenue growth that your guidance implies, is that kind of due to conservatism on occupancy, slowing rent growth or a combination of the two?
Ernest Freedman: Well. If you look on page 23 of our earnings release Jason, I think it will help - guide what happened in 2018 and give you a sense for what we think is going to happen in - on with regards to 2019. You see in 2018, your revenue growth of 4.5% was made up of 3.9% in rental rate growth, 50 bps increase in occupancy and then other income was a little bit better than those. And so that's how you get to 4.5%. If you get to the midpoint of our 4.1% revenue growth, we think we're at similar rental type growth maybe a tick lower than that as a midpoint but very similar. As you recall we have accelerating rent growth here starting in the fourth quarter of 2018 and we saw that in January as Charles talked about. But for the first three quarters of 2018 it was the deceleration year-over-year, so we need to earn that in. And then on occupancy growth, we do expect occupancy to be better than it was in 2019 versus 2018 but not necessarily 50 bps better. Now that said Charles is off to a really good start in January up 90 basis points and we're off to a good start on rental rate as well. And so when you factor that in and that's why we don't think we probably get to 4.5% with regards to our - the midpoint of our guidance but there's certainly a path for us to do better than that certainly seeing how well we started off the year with January.
Jason Green: And then the synergies that you guys had mentioned from the merger, are those factored in the same store guidance, or do those represent additional upside?
Ernest Freedman: No. Those are factored into our guidance. And so about 90% of the synergies that hit the field hit same store, the rest hit the total portfolio of the - about 90% of our homes in the same store. So those are factored in. So, in regards to getting to numbers we expect to from an expense perspective, it's taking into account synergies that we earned in 2018 as well as we anticipate the timing on the synergies. And to be clear, those synergies aren't all going to earn in on January 1. As Charles talked about, this won't be until mid-year, and we got the whole portfolio rolled out. And as we do that it's about 60 days after that where we get to that final numbers, and then have some overlap period to make sure if things are working right in the field. And so those will take a little while to earn here in 2019, but that's all factored into our guidance.
Jason Green: And then last one for me. Total cost to maintain came in for the year at about $3,200 per home. You're talking about that increasing potentially around 3% in 2019. Previously you'd said you know the long term rate is probably somewhere between $2,600 and $2,800. So, I guess first, is that still the long term rate that you guys feel will be necessary for total cost to maintain homes? And then how long does it take for you guys to get there?
Ernest Freedman: And so we came in I think close to $3,100 and $3,200, it's $3,109 for the year. But notwithstanding, we first came out with our IPO way back a couple of years ago, we do - we did say adjusting for inflation we expect to be at $2,600 to $2,800. So those numbers are going to move on us, those guideposts if there is inflation in the R&M world. And then we've actually seen probably more inflation in that than in other areas, just on what's been going on with broader products and services. That - you always need to reset that. That said, we're not quite where we think we're going to be in and getting back on that track. And as we further optimize and get things rolled out on the R&M side, and we've talked about in prepared remarks, we had a good fourth quarter, it was came in stronger than we thought, and we're excited about that with regards to what happened with R&M to bring us down to that $3,100 number that we came in for the year, we're going to cautious as we come out this year, and make sure things are going as we expect and move forward. I think what's are fully optimized everyone's working on the same platform. That's where we have the real opportunity to get back to - the numbers that we're more like what we thought we would end up with regard to the longer-term, growing for inflation, where we thought cost to maintain would be.
Operator: The next question will be from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Please go ahead.
Jade Rahmani: Are you seeing a pickup in interest from homebuilders in partnering with you?
Dallas Tanner: Hi, Jade. This is Dallas. It's interesting, we've had certainly had a number of discussions around opportunities and we're looking at a couple of different things. As I've mentioned before, we really are channel agnostic and we just want to make sure that we're focused on the right locations. So we're interested - we like the fact that I think homebuilders are getting more and more comfortable with the idea of single family owners being in their neighborhoods and buying product. I certainly could see it becoming more and more of an opportunity for us going forward. I don't think we have to take on any of that development risk ourselves. I've been - we've been pretty clear about that, but we certainly want to look for strategic partners that we can then be potential buyer for. We think that there's definitely opportunity for us there to grow.
Jade Rahmani: And what's your view toward master plan communities that feature apartments and standalone single family rental communities with high amenities targeted toward millennials?
Dallas Tanner: Well, it's an interesting concept that continues to evolve. We certainly know some of the operators and the owners that are building that product today. I think it's kind of a shift, quite frankly, I think it plays into some of the same demographics that we've been talking about. This 65 million person cohort between the ages of 20 and 35 that are coming our way, that want quality of choice and it's no different than the business we run today. I think where you got to be careful though Jade in some of those opportunities is you've got to still stay location specific in terms of where you want invest capital. Now, if that's - if it's a small boutique opportunity in an infill location with really good rents and at the square footage is our similar to what we would normally own, it would be something we look at, what I've seen across a broad spectrum of some of that product is, it's typically been much smaller footprint between 800 square feet and 1,300 square feet and that's not really our sweet spot more or less. But if we saw an opportunity, it was infill that made sense which certainly want to look at it and we're encouraged by the fact that people are recognizing that leasing is a real choice right now for people.
Jade Rahmani: And just on the influence of i-buyers on the market. Are you competing directly with them with respect to acquisitions? Are they distorting pricing or impacting the market in anyway and is there a potential opportunity to enter into joint ventures to provide centralized property management services since they are active in many of your markets.
Dallas Tanner: Let me answer kind of those in part. And I think, you're thinking about the world the right way Jade in terms of being an entrepreneur. This is an interesting moment in time with these i-buyers. There is - certainly, it feels like there's a new company popping up every day, who knows what will actually stick or last or who will be the kingpins in the long-term but we've - this is public record, we've been supportive of companies like open door and an Offer Pad, and Zillow that are out there making the home buying and selling experience much easier for the customer. Now 5.5 million transactions in the U.S. occur every year. So as you think about that. I mean there's plenty of space for brokers, i-buyers and individual investors to be buying and selling homes in the U.S. We certainly want to look for strategic partners that we can offer - that we can partner with, they help grow our footprint and our portfolio. We get the question a lot about what you want to do with third party management, that you could certainly see a day where that could be interesting. But now for us, it's just not really our focus. Our focuses on growing our own footprint, we see plenty of opportunity within our own book of business where we can continue to grow the Invitation Homes product along with the Invitation Homes didn't finish standards as well as didn't finish standards as well as the service levels that those - that our customers are wanting to expect. So it's not in our near term horizon by any stretch.
Operator: The next question will be from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: I can appreciate that there is a lot of moving parts last year on the expense side, volatility to the upside and the downside. But this year you have a 1% range on your same store expenses. Should we take that as a sense that all the moving parts are behind us and be more of a normal environment this year?
Dallas Tanner: Wes, we certainly think so we want to be cautious and want to set a range that we thought was appropriate. At the end of the day, we feel a lot better sitting today with the lessons learned over the last 12 months. You recall last year at this time we've provided guidance in the merger just closed about 60 days ahead of that and it actually closed ahead of schedule, we all thought they would actually close in early January, but fortunately we're able to get it done quicker. We're bringing two companies together, we run on the same platform, we're learning how each of the companies were doing things. And in a hindsight we've got a lot of things right, but a couple of things we did and unfortunately that caused some noise. We definitely feel much more confident, but again we're not 100% of the way there as we talked about in couple other things, but we're certainly so much further along than we were. So, we are feeling better for sure than we were last year and certainly as the year progressed.
Wes Golladay: And then you made a comment about the R&M being a little bit lower from the leasing from early last year, but looking at this year what are your expectations for blended rent growth for each of the quarter and not by quarter but just in general, do you expect to continue to modestly accelerate throughout the year based on those supply and demand you're seeing?
Dallas Tanner: We want to be careful with that. I did mention it in the prepared remarks, we obviously comp does get harder throughout the year as we make sure people realize that that means you're likely to see higher revenue growth earlier in the year because we don't have leasing later in the year. We'll see how it plays out. It's January, it's early in the year. We make our hay starting in mid-March has found when peak season starts for us and goes through end of July or early August. So, certainly when we're talking to you guys in about 90 days about first quarter results, we'll have a much better feel for whether we've seen that acceleration continue the pace it did in January.
Operator: The next question will be from Hardik Goel of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Hardik Goel: As I look across the guidance range, my first question is would you consider the low-end of guidance to be as likely as the high-end of guidance? And as a follow-up to that, what are the components of guidance that you look to as being drivers of potential downside to guidance, the midpoint and drivers of potential upside as well?
Dallas Tanner: Sure. Hardik, I think by definition we think it's equally likely as we put out our guidance at the low side could be a hit as well as [indiscernible]. We're certainly optimistic that we think we can do better, but that's the point of the range as we think that there are kind of equal weighted, but we certainly are excited how our January came out and we'll do our best to get more toward the high-end of those ranges. In terms of looking influence our ability to have upside to that or not, again peak leasing season on the revenue side would be the key and we're real pleased with how January came out for sure. And so, I think that that's going to be what will swing us in terms of the rent rate achievement. And then we're all always refocused first, but we've been able have been successful especially with lower turnover. We saw the lowest, we've ever seen as we looked at the fourth quarter that's really helped on the occupancy side. On the expense side, I think it's probably the obvious, it's just we know that we have troubles last year with comparison to maintenance cost to maintain. We're feeling better about it than we have, but we're not 100% there in terms of having everything optimizing and running. And the proof will be in the pudding - putting just like it is on the revenue side for peak leasing season, will become the summertime, when we hit the majority of our reporters that have to do around the HVAC season, will be better prepared for that this year by leaps and bounds than we were at last year but I think you know that will be the true test for us on the expense side as we get into peak order water season. How are we doing, are the teams optimized or is everything working the way we expect it to and we're pleased with the path we're on right now. And you know by midway through the year, you know come that the August call - the late July-August call, will have a pretty good sense, I think of how the year is playing out on the expense side.
Hardik Goel: And just one quick one, if you will indulge me. The move outs to buy were there a big driver of turnover being lower? Do you see them trend lower year-over-year or what was the trend there?
Dallas Tanner: Year-over-year they trended slightly lower. They've actually been more lower than the previous quarters and for the year they were definitely lower. So I think it's just - I think it's more broadly that people are pleased with the services that they're getting and are staying a little bit longer and fourth quarter is not as much activity as you know hard, so it's I don't know to draw a lot of conclusions from fourth quarter but we did see a little lower quarter-over-quarter like we did every other quarter this year. And so that certainly did help with the turnover number.
Operator: The next question will be from Alan Li of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alan Li: I had a question on G&A, is your 4Q number at good run rate and how should we think about incremental synergies savings real life mid quarters, as well as general seasonality?
Dallas Tanner: So we're right at a walk in our earnings release that showed how you get from where we ended up for 2018 for core FFO and to the midpoint of our guidance for 2019. And within that walk we did call out the fact that the growth property management expense in G&A combined, we expect to be about a penny better and it's not quite a penny around up to a penny. And so we are into a little bit better more so in G&A than in property management expense, but both numbers should be down year-over-year from where they were in 2018.and that's mainly from the earning of the synergies that still to go, and as well as the ones that happened in 2018. And there's not much to go still on the G&A and P&A numbers, so it's mainly their earning from 2018. But then understand, there are some cost inflation baked into there too, cost will remain static in terms of what's happening with compensation costs for the organization and other costs, and so you have a synergy good guy that more than offset an inflationary increase in those costs for 2019.
Alan Li: And I was wondering in terms of seasonality G&A how should I think of that.
Dallas Tanner: There's really not a lot of seasonality in G&A, that should be unless we - the only thing that potentially would do that would be around our bonus accruals, we try to do a good job throughout the year anticipating where those will come out. So you should see that be pretty steady each quarter throughout the year.
Operator: The next question will be from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Dallas and Ernie, could you provide the acquisition and disposition volume targets for this year.
Ernest Freedman: John, we're going to give early guidance around numbers that feel pretty similar to last year. We think we'll buy somewhere between $300 million and $500 million of assets on our base case scenario and we'll probably sell somewhere between $300 million and $500 million in assets.
John Pawlowski: And then Ernie, I understand you're not giving repair and maintenance expenses, I guess I'm still having trouble understanding where the easy comps are going, and middle of the year, you guys increased expense guidance pretty meaningfully that implied over $10 million of what was described as transitory costs. I know you're not completely refined but it still seems like a very, very easy comp that doesn't seem to be baked in the guidance, so I'm hoping you can provide a little bit more of a walk.
Ernest Freedman: John, I know - I saw what you had published back in December where you broke things out of that and more specifically about expectations from some of the different - the expense line items. And as I mentioned earlier, for net cost to maintain overall, we do expect to be up about 3%. And I know you had a number out there that I think was down 4% and of course with our better fourth quarter performance, I think that number is just to something that's probably closer to down 2%. So, there's certainly a disconnect from what you thought we would be with what was happening in the repairs and maintenance world versus where our guidance has come out. It might be best for us to try - talk offline to give you more information to help you try to bridge the gap between the two. At the end of the day, we had some good guys and we had some tough items that would help us from a comparable perspective. We also taken - we have taken account where we think cost inflation is going on a year-over-year basis if none of that was happening. And we don't need a good discussion and announce what your assumption was there versus what ours was. But overall we think we set ourselves up for a number that is achievable on all the expenses where we can get there and of course we're going to do our best to try to do better with some areas where we had some negative one timers last year and hopefully that sets us up to do a little bit better, but also a lesson learned from last year when to go out and make sure we're - we put out numbers that are achievable and we feel good about and we're confident in.
John Pawlowski: A follow-up on Wes's question around expense variability and I'm less concerned about what happened in 2018 and 2019, but just trying to figure out this business over the next three years to five years, but using 4Q 2018 as a case study to do that, the - so full year 2018 expenses come in well below the revised guidance range and 50% of your expenses actually hit your expectation with two months left in the year that implies huge variability for the rest of the line items. I know I've asked this question in the past, but it seems that this business model is going to be a lot more variability - have a lot more variability on expenses versus multi-family do you believe that to be the case and then a little bit color there would be great?
Ernest Freedman: Yes. John what I would tell you is I can speak for us. I don't want to speak broadly for the business. There are two companies or public companies and the other company does a great job with what they do and they can speak to that - they certainly speak to their strengths and what they do well. So just talk about Invitation Homes. We went through a big merger in 2018 and it was a little bit of - so many things went well for us, it was a little bit of surprise and caught us off guard about having some issues on the R&M side. And as we were wrapping up the third quarter and preparing for the third quarter call and it was felt that it was appropriate to revise our guidance. We want to do it in a way that we were confident we wouldn't mess. And on the - in hindsight, we overshot. I would rather have done that than not. And it turns out that the work is being led by Charles and Tim Lobner and all our folks in the field. They did even better than our wildest expectations in moving some of these things forward. And now there's still more to go. It's - I don't want to draw too much conclusion, John just from one quarter. You said the right thing, it was sort of the long term. Over the long term in these, how many companies have been in this - public for a long time and certainly Invitation Homes was before our merger. You didn't see that variability. So I think the majority of the variability is specific to some of the things that pop up when you bring two very large companies together that we're doing things a little bit differently and how to get it on, still not completely on one platform. The proof will be in the pudding over the next couple of years. Will this business be a little more variable than multi-family? I guess I'd ask you to look back in the 1990s when the multi-family companies were doing mergers and when you saw that kind of activity and go back and see with the variability wasn't their expenses when they were putting much smaller companies together. I suspect that they had similar variability in I think over time. It's a residential business that should be more predictable than other businesses; it could be now comparable to the multi-family. But certainly the other businesses so I know it's tough when we're in the moment John, but we're looking at a long term and feel a lot better where we are today than we were a year ago for sure. And we're all hoping, we want to see less variability in these expenses going on and we think we're going to continue to earn into that less variability as we continue to move forward.
Operator: The next question will be from Ryan Gilbert of BTIG. Please go ahead.
Ryan Gilbert: I understand that the demand for single-family rental product looks strong on an overall basis, but are there any markets in particular where you're seeing elevated move outs to buy or maybe just lower than expected traffic from potential renters?
Charles Young: No. This is Charles. We really haven't seen a demand as we said has really been strong across the board. Our turnover has been low which has been great, affordability is working in our favor. You can see our occupancy grow in Q4 and continue into January. In addition to our rent growth in January was up across almost all of our markets on a blended basis. So we're really - we're optimistic on how we're going into the year. There's always a few markets that we can see improvement and we've already started to see that in January and clearly we're being led with a lot of the West Coast markets and the demand that's out there.
Ryan Gilbert: And then how does the labor market feel for your field repairs and maintenance, property technicians? I understand it was you know pretty tight last year, has there been any change in your ability to source labor either positively or negatively?
Charles Young: The markets are tight, but we haven't seen any impact to our business in that perspective. I think we have a couple of real positive structural advantages as you think around how long our leadership has been here or scale that we have. If we do lose somebody, we have a deep bench of talent that we can pull from, and ultimately our employees enjoy our high dynamic environment and our mission of serving our residents. So you know we know that's been a conversation over the summer, and we're watching it closely, but we haven't seen any material impact to our techs.
Operator: The next question will be from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: First, Alex, congratulations. I'm curious if there is perhaps anything where your view may differ at all from your predecessor? Like say perhaps doing single family rental development in-house, maybe more meaningful changes on the geographic footprint, target leverage or anything else of that nature?
Dallas Tanner: It's a good question, a fair question. Thank you for the congratulations. Look I think if you - if Fred were here, I were here, quite frankly any of the other leadership that have been a part of Invitation Homes, our mission has been pretty consistent in terms of making sure that we had scale, density and high touch, high quality service, and good location. I think what Fred brought - my predecessor brought to the table was this, I singled towards some of the tech enhancements that were available to us. And so Charles and Fred were cutting edge in terms of Smarthome capabilities, some of those things that they're doing really well, we've obviously adopted that. I think as you think through what we believe kind of butter on the bread so to speak is just that consistent pragmatic approach to how you run your business. And so that won't change. And what I talked to earlier in my prepared remarks about staying true to our DNA, I mean, our DNA and you guys probably get sick of hearing it. But I would rather pay for the right locations and make sure then our DNA and you guys probably get sick of hearing it but I would rather pay for the right locations and make sure that we have infill dynamics happening around our portfolio. Then look for scale and growth opportunities where I've got to be outside of I call it infill locations. And so I think we don't differ all that much. And the good news is we've taken the best from both organizations on the path forward, Charles and I worked very well together; Ernie and I have worked together now for three plus years. We've got a nice energy amongst the management team and so we're excited to really push forward. I think to some of the earlier questions around what are the opportunities for growth we certainly see quite a bit of organic growth inside of our portfolio today that we can still go cash. So Charles was right when he said that we want to focus on making sure we finish the integration but we've got playbook of things that we're thinking about that we want to try to roll out over the next couple of years that we think will not only enhance the value of the real estate and the rents but make the customer stickier. And I think if we get really good at that piece of our business we're not going to be talking about the history of Invitation, this is about where are we going
Haendel St. Juste: Another question I guess on the same store expense outlook. I'm curious how much asset sales might be helping that line item and then as you confirm if the assets that you're contemplating selling are included in the same store pool and in that same-store expense right.
Dallas Tanner: So I would say that the assets that we have sold over the last period of time it's been kind of neutral to our results as the things came out from the bulk dispositions we saw the numbers looked like before and after it really didn't have a material impact with regards to what would - our numbers - what our numbers would have been for over 2018 and then for 2019 Haendel there are homes - there's homes that we've identified for sale and we've vacated them. That's when we take them out of same store because those specifically the homes we're trying to sell to end users, not to revoke disposition. If there's homes that were identified for sale that we think might go through a bulk disposition and they remain occupied those who will keep the same story until we get to the point where we have them under contract, we have a hard deposit and it's highly certain that the transaction is going to happen. So what happened is throughout the year you will see some homes move out of same store as they kind of go through the process that are identified for sale. So the answer is a little bit of both, some of them are out of same store today, but there will be some that we sell today that are currently in the same store.
Haendel St. Juste: And last one for me. You've mentioned Seattle and California being some of your better markets, I'm curious where are the more challenging markets and then what are the - what type of delta are you projecting between in terms of revenue between the upper and lower end of your portfolio in terms of revenue?
Charles Young: So, this is Charles, I'll jump in on the markets where we see opportunity. If you look in the results we put out the Dallas, Denver, Houston, our occupancy was below where we wanted. We've seen a really nice trajectory in all three markets. Dallas has moved up into the 95%s and we've seen really good blended rent growth increase in January as well, we've sustained that occupancy. Denver is on a really nice move where finished January above 95%, 95.2% and February continues to rise with blended rent growth also going. Houston we've maintained our occupancy up to 95%, rent growth kind of flat. So we see those as markets that will continue to get better throughout the year. If you look back over 2018, we made really good progress on our Florida markets and with such a large presence there, Orlando has been strong for us all year, but Tampa and South Florida have really come along. So we're excited about getting the whole portfolio balanced in and operating so much of what we've seen out on the West Coast and Orlando markets.
Haendel St. Juste: And quickly on Tampa, I recall there are being the issue last year with some of the personnel, just can you quickly update us on that stands personnel back in place, regional or local property management teams fully operating and everything is - I guess gets back to where you - you want it there or can you maybe give some color on that?
Dallas Tanner: We're in really good shape in Tampa. A lot of the noise you just discussed was early in the year. We were able to address it quickly, as we talked about. And part of that is showing up in our results in Q4 on both the top line and the bottom line. So we feel really good around where Tampa stands for us.
Operator: The final question today will be from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Anthony Paolone: So thanks for the disposition and acquisition guidance nets to zero on how do you think about that versus maybe just reducing - producing leverage our average or faster?
Dallas Tanner: Well that's a great question. We have to have a base case scenario and we feel very comfortable to Ernie's earlier points on guidance with the guidance we're putting out, we think we can acquire creatively somewhere between $300 million and $500 million. We think we can also recycle you know easily between $300 million and $500 million on the sales side. You know it's certainly if there's something opportunistic, where we look at a situation that it might make sense. We could look at selling or buying more, but I would say that will help us the base case scenario that we laid out will help us achieve our goals we want to make sure that we have, a kind of an eye focused single to getting to investment grade and we know that by you know calling and selling the parts of the portfolio, what we're seeing underperformance in the recycling that cost little or you know prepaying debt will put us on that path to that investment grade balance sheet that we ultimately want. Ernie, I don't know if you want to add anything to that but I think that's generally how we feel about it, Andy.
Anthony Paolone: And then you talked a lot about rate in your - occupancy and those drivers to the same-store revenue picture. Is there anything appreciable to think about through either revenue management or other income that might contribute or not in 2019?
Ernest Freedman: Yes. We think other income will probably grow it a little bit less of a pace than it did in 2018, but not significantly so. But again that's our base case to get to our midpoint of our guidance. From the revenue management perspective, overall, the team's doing a great job with - under Dallas and Charles leadership to try to optimize and what we've seen - we talked about it going into the fourth quarter, we felt really good going into the off season being highly occupied and then Charles talked about where the January numbers are. It's really putting us in that position to be more offensive than we've been in the last couple of years as we get into peak leasing season, that's the wrong way to say more offensive. We're really pleased with where we're at and we can optimize. And so the teams doing a nice job there and again this is another year of knowledge of both portfolios and teams working together, so that sets us up - we're set up well where we need to start accomplishing as we get to March, April and May.
Anthony Paolone: So you think that the revenue management is actually been part of the driver to kind of the strong occupancy in some of this rate growth?
Charles Young: This is Charles. Absolutely. That was one of the first parts of the combined company that we put together and once we got onto the hood we were able to take best practices of both and it showed up early in the year but by the second half of the year we really hit our stride and it showing up well in Q4 and continues into 2019.
Anthony Paolone: And then last question just on G&A you kind of talked about that, but just on non-cash company appreciable difference in 2019 versus 2018 on that front?
Charles Young: There will be, because a lot of that non-cash comp that came from the IPO finished its vesting in the early part of 2019. So the majority of that expense was recognized in 2017 and 2018. So, the non-cash comp around share based comp it does come down materially. Let me - we had a question about that earlier too. It's interesting about how we can get something out there so folks can get on more comfortable about modeling equity. It doesn't come into our core FFO number because it's been so volatile, going forward it will be much less volatile. But now that we're past that to your point, there was a vesting period on the equity grants associated with the IPO for those of us, for those folks at Invitation Homes who are here for that. We'll get to much more of what I call a normalized run rate of share based comp but let me put our heads together and we'll try to figure out a way that we can and provide some more help there for folks
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Dallas Tanner for his closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you again for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and the team looks forward to seeing many of you in March. Operator this concludes our call.
Operator: Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time you may disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Invitation Homes Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greg Van Winkle, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Van Winkle: Thank you. Good morning. And thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. On today's call from Invitation Homes are Dallas Tanner, Interim President and Chief Investment Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; and Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer. I'd like to point everyone to our third quarter 2018 earnings press release and supplemental information, which we may reference on today's call. This document can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, at www.invh.com. I'd also like to inform you that certain statements made during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We described some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2017 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from the time-to-time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. During this call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these new measures with the most comparable GAAP measures, in our earnings release and supplemental information, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll now turn the call over to our Interim President and Chief Investment Officer, Dallas Tanner.
Dallas Tanner: Thank you, Greg. We are pleased to report our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit Core FFO growth, with Core FFO per share in the third quarter increasing 21% year-over-year. Trailing 12 months' turnover reached its lowest level in our history as a public company, at approximately 34%, as residents continue to value the high quality living experience and service we provide. This contributed to a 50 basis point year-over-year increase in Same Store occupancy to 95.5% in the third quarter. The favorable supply and demand fundamentals we are experiencing in our markets show no signs of abating, with renewal rent growth of 4.8% in the third quarter, and new lease rent growth consistent with prior year. We also took a number of steps in the third quarter and October to improve the efficiency of our R&M platform. While we still have fine-tuning to do before next peak work-order season, R&M expenses for the second half of 2018 are tracking in line with our expectations we revised mid-year. However, we are experiencing some pressure on real estate taxes that we expect to impact our fourth quarter expenses unfavorably versus our prior expectations. Ernie will talk more about this later. Before we get into the details of the quarter and expectations for the rest of the year, I want to step back, because it's the bigger picture that makes us really excited about this business. We continue to see a multitude of opportunities creating a long runway for growth. First is simply the fundamentals of supply and demand. In our select high-growth markets, household formations in 2019 are forecasted to grow at a rate of 1.9%, which is 90% greater than the U.S. average. There remains a shortage of housing supply to meet this demand. And we expect that to remain the case near-term in our markets with home prices still well below replacement cost. We think renting should continue to become increasingly attractive versus owning for single-family home seekers, with interest rates rising and home prices in our markets still increasing approximately 6.5% year-over-year. To that point, move-outs to homeownership within our portfolio continue to track lower versus last year. Looking further ahead, demographics should become even more of a tailwind. There are 67 million people in the U.S. currently aged 20 to 34. And they are coming our way as they reach the life stage in which their needs change to align with our product and our service. We continue to see many newly formed households choosing to come into Invitation Homes, where they can combine the ability to live in a high-quality well-located single-family home with the convenience of leasing from a professional manager that puts the resident first. That brings me to the next opportunity, service, which is the most important part of the value proposition we offer residents. We think the service we provide is best in class, and the reason we experience such high resident retention. But we're always looking to get better. In 2019, we'll expand our ProCare best practices to further enhance the resident experience. Longer term, we think there are more opportunities to enhance that experience that will also benefit ancillary income. One way we do that today is with our Smart Home technology. But we can envision many more products and services that might ultimately make residents' lives more convenient. Near term, we are focused on the final phase of merger integration. We've accomplished a tremendous amount to date, on or ahead of schedule and with more synergies than initially expected. Synergies unlocked to date total $41 million on a run rate basis, meaning we've achieved our year-end 2018 target months ahead of our previous expectations. The last step of integration is to roll out our unified operating platform to the field, which should unlock remaining synergies. And once we cross the integration finish line and have all aspects of the company working together as one, we'll look for even more ways to leverage our scale and experience to further fine-tune that efficiency. On the portfolio front, our investment management team is actively working to further enhance our location and scale advantages. We're on track in 2018 to dispose of roughly $0.5 billion of homes with lower long-term growth prospects. And are using these proceeds to acquire homes in better locations and de-lever our balance sheet. We've purchased over $200 million of homes with higher expected IRRs. And we've reduced net debt by a $150 million so far in 2018. We've also invested over $10 million in value enhancing CapEx. Last but not least, we're excited about the abundance of new private capital coming into the single-family rental space. It's coming, because others see the same fundamentals, and potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns that we see. It also creates even more opportunity for us to shape our portfolio at the margins. We believe many of the private platforms are looking to build scale by acquiring homes that match the profile of what we are seeking to sell. Case in point is the series of bulk sales we executed in September and October, which I would like to spend a little time talking about. We ran a process to dispose off a cohort of lower rent band homes that no longer fit our long-term strategies. These homes had an average in-place rent of $1,404, 25% below the rest of our portfolio, and were concentrated in Chicago, the Southeast, South Florida and parts of Tampa. We received multiple bids on these pools of homes, and optimized value in execution by splitting it into 5 separate transactions, totaling 1,375 homes for gross proceeds of $214 million. The primary use of these proceeds will be to prepay debt. In addition to the homes sold in bulk, 147 of which closed in the third quarter, we sold another 266 homes in one-off transactions during the third quarter. We also purchased 249 homes in the quarter, at an average cap rate of 5.6%. Acquisitions were focused primarily in Seattle, Denver, Phoenix, Orlando and Atlanta. Before I turn it over to Charles, let me sum up everything I just talked about. First, although we're working through some near-term expense challenges, we feel great about overall single-family rental fundamentals today and into the future, and continue to see very strong occupancy and rent growth. Second, we feel even better about Invitation Homes' growth prospects, in particular given the location, scale and service advantages which we enjoy. And third, we maintain an entrepreneurial energy and focus on creating value through initiatives around merger integration, service platform optimization, ancillary income, capital recycling, value enhancing CapEx, and balance sheet deleveraging. Lastly, I'd like to say thank you to all of our teams in the field and our corporate offices. I just talked about a lot of exciting things we have going on at Invitation Homes. And it's our innovative and hardworking people that turn those opportunities into realities. To those all across our company that are committed to serving residents and dreaming of ways to make the resident experience better, you will be the driving force behind the value we create for both residents and shareholders as we move forward. And I thank you sincerely for your dedication to that mission. With that, I'll turn it over to Charles Young, our Chief Operating Officer, to provide more detail on our operating results in the third quarter.
Charles Young: Thank you. I'd like to echo Dallas' sentiment about our people. It's been a busy year and I'm most proud of that through all the change the commitment of our field teams to providing outstanding customer service has never wavered. Resident satisfaction remains high, as evidenced by further improvement in turnover rate to 33.9% on a trailing 12 month basis. To my partners in the field who earn the loyalty of our residents every day, thank you. I'll now walk you through the details of our third quarter 2018 operating performance. Same Store Core revenues in the third quarter grew 4.4% year-over-year, in line with our expectations. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by average monthly rental rate growth of 3.8%, and a 50 basis point increase in average occupancy to 95.5% for the quarter. The strong top line results drove Same Store NOI growth of 4.9%, as Same Store Core expense increased 3.7%. R&M expenses remain elevated, in line with our expectations prior to optimization of our R&M platform. And strong home price appreciation continues to drive property taxes - tax increases, but these factors were partially offset in the third quarter by year-over-year decreases in various other controllable expenses. As a reminder, we expect both R&M expenses and property taxes to accelerate higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Last year service requests related to Hurricane Irma and Harvey were prioritized in the fourth quarter of 2017, which pushed routine, non-storm related service requests that normally would have been resolved in 2017 into the first quarter 2018. This resulted in a benefit to R&M expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 creating a difficult comparison for this year's fourth quarter. Property taxes also face a difficult comparison in the fourth quarter 2018, as last year's fourth quarter benefited from lower-than-expected real estate tax assessments that drove favorable or accrual true-ups. I also want to update you on our efforts to optimize our recently integrated R&M technology platform. Since the beginning of third quarter, we have implemented many changes to our systems and processes that determine whether work order should be addressed in-house or by third parties. How the corresponding service trips get scheduled and the optimal routes for the technicians, who make those trips. And just last week we rolled out an important update to our technology platform that enables all of our internal technicians regardless of legacy organization to perform work orders on any home in our portfolio, not just the homes associated with their legacy organization. We still have work to do though and will continue implementing process improvements and ProCare enhancements in the months leading up to next peak or quarter season. We also think the unification of our field teams and property management platform in 2019 will be a key catalyst for unlocking efficiencies in our R&M platform. Next, I'll cover third quarter 2018 leasing trends. Fundamentals in our markets remain as strong as ever. Net effective renewal rent growth increased to 4.8% in the third quarter of 2018 from 4.7% in the second quarter 2018. New leases were 3.3% in the third quarter in line with both the prior year and our expectations as we managed rates to ensure we exit at peak leasing season with strong occupancy. This resulted in blended rent growth of 4.2% in the third quarter 2018 and an occupancy gain of 50 basis points year-over-year to 95.5%. Western U.S. markets continue to lead the way for growth with Northern and Southern California, Seattle and Phoenix remaining are strongest. With fundamental tailwinds at our back, we are focused on executing to finish the year strong. Our field teams are also well prepared for the rollout of our integrated operating platform, which will be piloted in our first markets soon. We look forward to leveraging that platform in 2019 to deliver the leasing lifestyle our residents desire in an even more efficient manner. With that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Ernie Freedman.
Ernest Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today, I will cover the following topics: balance sheet and capital markets activity; financial results for the third quarter; integration synergy update, and 2018 guidance update. I'll start with our balance sheet and capital markets activity. We remain focused on achieving an investment grade rating and have made good progress to date, we have de-risked our maturity profile by refinancing over $3 billion of 2019 and 2020 debt maturities in the first half of this year. Extending our weighted average maturity to 5.2 years, up from 4.1 at the beginning of the year, only 11% of our debt is subject to changes in interest rates on average over the next nine years. In the size of our unencumbered pool has increased by over 10% to approximately 39,000 homes or almost half our assets. In the third quarter and October, we prepaid another $250 million of securitized debt maturing in 2021 using proceeds from our June 2018 refinancing activity and cash on hand. We'll continue to be opportunistic in refinancing and prepaying debt as it makes sense going forward. And as Dallas mentioned separately, we have received proceeds of $214 million from bulk sales in September and October. We intend to use almost all the proceeds from these transactions to prepay debt modestly improving our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Our liquidity at quarter end was over $1.1 billion through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facility. I'll now cover our third quarter 2018 financial results. Core FFO and AFFO per share for the third quarter increased 21.3% and 10.2% year-over-year respectively to $0.29 and $0.22. The primary drivers of the increases were growth in NOI per share in addition to lower adjusted G&A and lower cash interest expense per share. Supplemental schedule one provides a reconciliation from GAAP net income to a reported FFO, Core FFO and AFFO. I'll next provide an update on our merger integration. We continue to expect $50 million to $55 million of synergies from our merger. On a run rate basis, we have achieved $41 million to date, outpacing our previous expectation for 75% achievement by year-end 2018. $36 million of those synergies achieved to date relate to G&A and property management costs. $4 million our NOI synergies and the remaining $1 million is Cap Ex, of the synergies remaining to be achieved we expect about two-thirds to relate to NOI. Last thing, I will cover is updated 2018 guidance. The primary change to our Same Store guidance is related to expenses and due almost entirely to revised property tax expectations. Charles mentioned already that we have a difficult comparison in the fourth quarter on real estate taxes due to lower-than-expected assessments in last year's fourth quarter that drove favorable accrual true-ups. This year we are experiencing the opposite, property tax reassessments received in October 2018 have trended higher-than-expected, especially in Florida and for Prop 13 related reassessments in California triggered by our IPO. We will appeal reassessments in cases, where we feel it is appropriate. However, property taxes which make up almost 50% of our overall operating expenses are likely to be higher in the fourth quarter of 2018 than what was contemplated in previous guidance. Excluding real estate taxes all other operating expenses are expected to fall within the previous range of guidance expectations, but some are trending towards the higher end of that previous range. However, repairs and maintenance expenses are on track for the midpoint of what was contemplated in previous guidance. As a result, we now expect 2018 Same Store core operating expense growth of 5.4% to 6% For core revenue growth, we are narrowing our guidance range to 4.4% to 4.5% resulting in revised Same Store NOI guidance of 3.5% to 4%. Taking into account a revised expectations for Same Store results and other items. We are updating our 2018 Core FFO guidance range to $1.16 to $1.18 per share, and our AFFO guidance range to $0.93 to $0.95 per share. The midpoint of these ranges imply growth of 13% and 7.4% respectively versus prior year. Stepping back, I'd like to finish our prepared remarks with three thoughts. First, expense growth has surprised us from our initial expectations at the beginning of the year. Our growth in real estate taxes is due to the values of our homes increasing and in addition outsized increases above our expectations in the reassessments of our homes due to our IPO in early 2017. We are very focused on improving results and other expenses. Charles provided a number of details on the steps in the progress we are making relative to repairs and maintenance challenges. Second, our revenue growth is tracking to our original expectations. Rate growth is solid, turnover continues to trend favorably, and as a result average occupancy has improved. We like how we are positioned as we close out the year. Third, importantly, the overall fundamentals of our industry are strong. Macroeconomic supply, demand and demographic factors are favorable. For those that might be considering owning a home versus leasing is becoming increasingly more difficult for them to do so. When you consider the various external and internal opportunities for continued growth as well as improvement to our portfolio and balance sheet, we believe we are still in the early innings of value creation. With that operator, would you please open up the line for questions?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Douglas Harter of Credit Suisse.
Douglas Harter: Thanks. Can you talk about any pressures you're seeing on employee retention in the field?
Charles Young: Yes. This is Charles. Look, we have seen very little actually turnover in the field, nothing extraordinary. But as we pay attention to what's happening in the business, there are new entrants in this space, also new ventures that are in the [peripheral] [ph] space. And we have talented people. And they're naturally going to look at those people, however, no material loss and just a handful of one-off in a couple of markets. Last thing I'll add with that is, part of what helps retain our employees is they're enthusiastic about our position in this space as the best-in-class leader, take pride in our mission, and enjoy our dynamic and high energy culture. And we think all this helps us retain our talent. So we haven't seen much employee turnover.
Douglas Harter: I guess, following up on that, have you seen any incremental sort of cost to retain or you haven't really seen the pressure on that to this point?
Charles Young: Nothing material. As individual circumstances come up, like I said, there's been a few. We've addressed them, and haven't had to make any across-the-board changes.
Douglas Harter: Great. Thank you, Charles.
Operator: The next question comes from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Shirley Wu: Hi, this is actually Shirley Wu with Juan Sanabria. Thanks for your time. So for your revenue guidance, you're implying acceleration in 4Q. What's the benefit from occupancy, and when do you expect that to normalize from the hurricane?
Dallas Tanner: A couple things there, Shirley, one, we're very pleased with how things are playing out for the rest of the year, and specifically for October, just to give those results as well, we've had a 60 basis point increase year-over-year. Our October average of daily occupancy was 95.8%. Last year, it was 95.2%. And we've seen good strength from renewal increases, 4.7%, which is about 20 bps off of last year. But we see new lease accelerate to 1.8%, which is 40 bps better than we had last year. So the blend came in very similarly. So we expect to continue to see better year-over-year occupancy results like we saw in the third quarter. That's certainly helping us. And we're seeing rate activity right now, which is consistent or slightly better than what we had last year, especially when you look in September and October.
Shirley Wu: Got you. So you're not expecting any benefit from the hurricane from last year or…?
Dallas Tanner: No, I - go ahead, Charles, if you want to talk to that.
Charles Young: Minimal in occupancy in the Florida markets. Outside of that nothing, nothing across the board.
Dallas Tanner: We didn't see a big degradation in occupancy from them, so we wouldn't expect to - they're an easy comp relative to occupancy.
Charles Young: There was a brief slowdown in leasing.
Shirley Wu: Okay. And on real estate taxes, how much are you - how many of the valuations are you appealing? And historically, how many of those appeals have you actually won?
Dallas Tanner: Sure, it varies by state by state. And we're sorting through those as they come in. And as we talked about in October, a big chunk started come in Florida. So we haven't made a final determination yet as to how many we will appeal. We have some time. In the past, it varied by market. And we have a valuation team that goes specifically and says which ones we think we have the best opportunity just to make a win on. We don't appeal everything in mass. I know some folks consider doing that. But we take a very thoughtful approach to it. And then we look to try to negotiate as well as appeal with the local jurisdictions. So it's early days to be able to say, Shirley, exactly how many we'll do. In the past, we've had certain successes in some states more than others. Generally because we're less - we're more selective, excuse me, on what we choose to appeal. Win percentage is pretty good, but it varies from year to year.
Shirley Wu: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Shirley.
Operator: The next question will come from Nick Joseph of Citi.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Does update guidance assume maybe level of success on real estate appeal this year?
Dallas Tanner: It does not, Nick. We won't get results from those from anywhere from a minimum 9 months, to sometimes it takes two to three years, so unless we had some appeals from a year or two ago that we expected to get. And in general, we don't guide to that, because they are - they can be a bit uncertain. We wouldn't expect any upside from appeals. We're hopeful for the rest of this year.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And just other than the real estate taxes, what other expense line items are trending towards the high-end of the guidance range?
Dallas Tanner: Yeah, sure. So we've talked about real estate taxes, R&Ms, we talked about importantly before. We feel pretty good about in terms of where that's coming in. I would expect that we'll see leasing and marketing come in, even though it's been doing well favorably year-over-year, will probably come in a little bit higher than we anticipated, as we continue to see the strong marketing opportunity for us to push forward and gain occupancy. For us [indiscernible] looks pretty good. Utilities tend to be a little bit a wildcard. I bake in a little conservatism into utilities. But we may see that come in a little bit on the higher side as well. And then, we talked about repairs and maintenance. Turnover is trending very similarly to that. But maybe it will be slightly more toward the higher end of the range that we had before relative, where R&M is coming more to the midpoint of what we thought before.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, Nick.
Operator: And our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste: Hey, good morning.
Dallas Tanner: Hey, Haendel.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste: So, I guess, a question on some of the acquisitions and dispositions here. I'm curious how the pricing on what you're looking to potentially buy here, compare on the mid-5 on what you're selling. I guess I'm curious - more curious on what the IRRs of what's coming in versus what's going out on the portfolio look like. And then any color on sort of who is buying here? Is it private equity and maybe some of the underwriting that they're doing?
Dallas Tanner: Yeah, hi, Haendel. So I'll answer it in a couple of ways. We're still seeing really good fundamentals in the mid-5s in terms of the types of properties we can buy. You'll notice that on the buy side for us in the third quarter, we're very active in Seattle, Phoenix and Orlando, all markets that lend themselves to better performance on a risk-adjusted basis, in terms where we're seeing growth. On the sell side, cap rates can vary. And it just depends on why you're trying to get out of a particular asset. So for us, we mentioned this in the release, we went into a series of bulk transactions, because we're looking for ways to improve our portfolio on the margin. This has been ordinary course for us for a couple of years. We've done this consistently. Our focus specifically with these sales was to get out of some of the lower rent band properties, in and around geographies where we already had considerable amount of scale and where we saw potentially future CapEx or R&M risk. And so for us those sales were in the higher-5s, pushing towards a 6. But they were strategic in a sense in that they were about $350 on a per rent band level lower than what our average rents in the portfolio are today. In terms of the new capital that's coming into the space, we spend a lot of time talking to some of these capital and these operators. They come in and are looking for different ways to grow their own portfolio. So we're cognizant of what opportunities might be out there for us from a disposition standpoint. Can't speak specifically to what their IRRs are that they're seeking. We tend to be on at a little bit higher price point, little bit higher rent band than most of our peers, which creates a really good environment for us, when we want to sell on the margin, on some of our lower rent band or kind of mixed geography parts of our portfolio.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And I guess, a question or two for you, Charles, on the op-side. I guess, curious how the traffic demand trended there in the third quarter, especially with the uptick in rates and what you're hearing or feeling on that front. How do you think about pricing power given some the comments you guys provided in your prepared remarks about the expected benefit from millennials and the demographic factors, and also, obviously, helped by what could be affordability being stretched here? We're hearing, obviously, that U.S. home sales are slowing. So just curious on how the traffic and demand materialize over the quarter and how you're feeling or thinking about the implications for the business of rising rates into next year.
Charles Young: Got you. That was a mouthful. But we appreciate the question. So I think you're talking on top line demand. So overall, we've seen a good demand in the third quarter. You could see that with our 50 basis points increase in occupancy. Rates have been solid in what we expected seasonal for the quarter. And Ernie gave you the October numbers, which are real good. We're really proud of especially the new lease growth acceleration to 1.8% versus 1.4% last year at this time. So we're seeing good demand. Website stats are up. And our occupancy is, going into this fourth quarter, right where we want it to be, which is part of our plan in the third quarter.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste: Okay. And, I guess, last one for me. I'm just curious. I was a little surprised, maybe encouraged to hear your comments about labor availability, and I guess, that inflation - cost inflation on the on the labor side. I'm curious, have you seen or are you anticipating any impact to turn-times in the general shortage of labor? Is that impacting your business at all or did you see an increase in turn-times? And then, did that impact your ability to make homes ready for lease and any impact on your on your metrics?
Charles Young: Now, we haven't seen any of that. Reality is we have great vendors from both portfolios and we've done a good job of managing those vendors and increasing our turn-times down. We obviously and always want to do better, but we haven't seen any impact across the board maybe some one-off in certain markets, but nothing material.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste: What were the turn-times in 3Q?
Charles Young: We're about 15, 17 days, which is typically higher than where we want to be, but volume was high in Q3. And so that's difficult. It started to come down now that we're in Q4 and we'll get faster and faster get down in the 10 to 12 days, which we expect.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste: Okay. Thank you.
Charles Young: This is just for a visible turn on the asset.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste: Right, right. I got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill: Hi, good morning. Thank you, guys. First question, probably for you, Dallas, on transactions in the quarter and mentioning some of this was at a lower price band expense. It's kind of two part question, but really when you look at the difference in rent growth some of that's impacted by just the geography of the portfolio and understanding different mixes within markets. So can you just elaborate a little bit more on how you think about the sale being price point driven versus market driven as they're skew in what you did in the third quarter and thus far in the fourth quarter or all of these homes generally on the lower band. And then kind of wrapping into that if it is a lower band, it would be the area of demand market where you think would be most impacted by higher rates and qualifications. So I just want to understand how you think about the interim play there.
Dallas Tanner: Yeah. Happy to give a little bit more color there. There's a variety of reasons, I mean, typically we are looking for a bit more of a higher rent band down home, in terms of what we're purchasing in all 17 markets that we're in today. In terms of what we sold, there's a variety of reasons in there, and why we sold what we sold, it certainly centers around lower price points generally speaking across these markets. But we sold 425 homes for example in Chicago, and we've mentioned that on a couple of previous calls that we were going to look to that exposure in parts of the Midwest can be smart, in terms of how we're going to try to continue to shape that portfolio. We also sold a couple of hundred homes in South Florida and Tampa as well as some homes in Dallas, which is a market that we're currently buying in. So for us on the margins, just about getting the portfolio right, nine times out of 10, it has to do with kind of where we're seeing the best risk adjusted growth in that market, and then trying to prune our portfolio out of the parts of that market we're seeing less growth generally speaking. That tends to be sometimes most lower rent band type of areas. But, I'll give you a flipside example of that would be if you were to sell homes in Palm Beach County for example, they may be some of our more expensive homes in our portfolio, but we're just not seeing the same type of growth we're seeing in other parts of Dade and Broward County. So it can depend on the margin, it's just important that you just have to make sure that you're getting the right parts of the portfolio sold at the most opportune prices.
Dennis McGill: So would you look at it almost the lower end of the entry level price point is where you're struggling with growth more so than the upper end of the entry level? Or are you stretching to the move to where you see the most strength in growth?
Dallas Tanner: So I would say the fairways typically in the middle and even sometimes at those lower price points where you can see some of the best opportunities for growth quite frankly, it's just we also sell homes for a variety of reasons around maintenance of future CapEx risk. We've managed a lot of these homes now for six or seven years, we have a pretty good sense of the home health scorecard so to speak on a home, and we can start to do some predictive thinking around where we probably want to limit some exposure in the future.
Dennis McGill: Okay. Got it. And then just a follow up on the property tax side. The pressure in the fourth quarter, the difference in the fourth quarter versus guidance would you attribute that more to just a true-up relative to where you thought the year would be starting 2018? Or does that leave you with more pressure into 2019 than you would have been assuming before as well?
Ernest Freedman: Dennis, it's the former of the two that you said is the pressure of that we were under accrued specifically in Florida. We'd assume that real estate taxes would be up about 6% in Florida, and that's what we've been accruing to all year, we thought that was a reasonable assumption and it wasn't that far off from where it was last year. When assessments and [managed rates] [ph] finally came out in October, and actually it was a taxable just been dropping over the last week we choose to the finalized [managed rates] [ph] it looks like that Florida's one coming closer to 7.5% maybe even up to 8%. And that's where the main put most of the pressure is almost 40% of our real estate taxes going to the state of Florida. As you know, we own about a third of our homes there, and it is a higher tax regimes. It's definitely, and we thought we were accruing at the appropriate rate and sometimes you get right and sometimes you get wrong, in this case we got a little bit wrong unfortunately.
Dennis McGill: I guess, if you think about that 7.5% you're going to next year now. Is that a pressure that essentially continues into next year in that elevated level?
Dallas Tanner: We'll make that judgment as we work with the experts to help us with our real estate projections. I'll be a little bit early to provide any thought on a market-by-market basis is what we think is going to have with real estate taxes, but overall, Dennis, with home price appreciation still being pretty strong and driving the value of our portfolio is certainly likely that real estate taxes will be a pressure point relative to inflation with the important exception for us with 20% of California, we do at the cap with Prop 13.
Dennis McGill: Great. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you, guys.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks.
Operator: The next we have a question from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Charles, I appreciate the comments on turnover and pressures on the payroll costs, you're not seeing the pressure now next year in 2020, do you have to pay your repair and maintenance field personnel significantly higher than you are today. We're not seeing any material pricing in terms of how we need to pay our internal teams there will be a normal kind of merit cycle that we go through? That being said we're keeping our eye on the labor markets. We understand there it target are there could be some inflation in the labor cost, but not really seeing anything that is not going to be manageable in terms of how we're predicting our numbers?
Ernest Freedman: Hey, John, So remember that we've drawn a lot of our people from the sector from the general housing industry. So I think a lot of that will be answered by what's happening in the broader housing industry around home building and what's going to happen there.
John Pawlowski: Okay. I understand the comments about a new capital funding base, that's been going on for about a year or so even longer than anything else specifically change in recent months from your lands to ramp disposition and delever a little bit quicker?
Ernest Freedman: No. I mean, not at all. I mean, as you take a step back, we've been pretty clear about our intentions to get our balance sheet investment grade. So when we laid out guidance at the beginning of the year. We said, we would sell somewhere between $300 million to $500 million of homes in 2018. And we anticipate that we were pretty close to that number that $500 million number. Our acquisition pace has been kind of well aligned the same way. I think, it's just been fortuitous, quite frankly. And again, we've done both sales for a number of years. But it definitely feels like there's a good market today for us, if we want to be a seller in the transaction that we just recently did we were at what we perceive market value to be on these homes with very minimal frictional costs, because if you're in that process internally. And so, for us we look at it as a win, John. It's just a good time in the market to be a seller on some of these homes that don't fit your portfolio perfectly.
John Pawlowski: Yeah. I guess, more broadly, has the rapid sell off in your share price change your capital allocation plan had in 2019?
Ernest Freedman: I wouldn't say, so. I mean, we're mission focused in terms of working towards investment grade and we clearly pay attention to where the share price is on a given week or month. But we're focused at the task at hand, which is finishing the merger integration rolling out our field integration process through the fourth quarter in early parts of the first quarter of next year, getting on one system so that we can optimize. We feel really good about where we are, as Charles mentioned on the occupancy point. And we feel like, right now, we're in a good spot, we just need to continue to execute.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks, John.
Ernest Freedman: Thanks, John.
Operator: The next question will come from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley.
Richard Hill: Hey, guys, I want to maybe circle back and focus on the revenue side of the equation for a moment. Obviously, rising home prices is good on one hand, but it also makes it more challenging to buy homes. So I was wondering, if maybe you could balance out the external growth versus internal growth and maybe give some examples as to, if you're considering external growth and if not what are your primary drivers of internal growth at this point?
Dallas Tanner: Yeah. I'll start with that. First and foremost, we're focused on getting to that investment grade balance sheet as we said before. Now, with that being said, we would certainly look at any opportunity if it were opportunistic. However, we are mission focused in terms of just executing on our business and being a kind of a net capital recycle maybe to a net seller side on a small basis. Outside of that as you look at kind of where we're finding that growth both extremely or organically. We see a lot of opportunities in front of us, we talked about that at the beginning of the call, and that we still see a lot of ways that we can enhance the overall customer experience, while you lease from Invitation Homes. And we see that in a myriad ways to both Charles and I are working on to enhance the overall customer experience, and that will include outside services beyond just the smart home technology, which is one of the few things we offer today. So in our opinion we see a lot of blue sky in that arena and that bucket that we're going to try to continue to work on as a business and a brand will be to enhance that overall experience, so that our customer stays with us longer. And more importantly that we can make that leasing lifestyle that much more attractive.
Richard Hill: Got it. Got it. So just to be clear, so I can understand, it sounds like most of the drivers of revenue are going to be on the internal side. And at this point, you're not seeing sort of any sort of ceiling in terms of where rents can go, in terms of where maybe renters are willing to pay.
Dallas Tanner: Well, it's - we certainly our own expectations for where we believe rent growth will be at any given time. And as I Ernie mentioned before, we're not in a position where we're going to give any guidance for 2019. With that being said, we feel very comfortable as Charles laid out, where we said occupancy wise today 95.8%, that's a really good number at the end of October. But we see a lot of that growth coming obviously through the top line piece of the business. But then, in addition, we think there's a lot of ancillary revenue opportunities that are in front of us for our business today.
Richard Hill: Got it. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks.
Operator: And next we have a question from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.
Steve Sakwa: Thanks. Good morning, Ernie, I think on your guidance assumptions you did take down the AFFO number by a couple of pennies. And I'm just wondering, if you could talk about CapEx, and then where you see kind of R&M, turnover and Cap Ex cost per home for the year, and how you see that trending going forward?
Ernest Freedman: Yeah. You're absolutely, right, Steve. We laid out the last call, we've had challenges on R&M side both on the OpEx and on the CapEx side, and where R&M is come in at our higher expectations we expected for the rest of the year. And we continue to see some challenges there on the CapEx side. And we are going to come in on a number higher than we've talked about in the past for our total cost to maintain, which includes both OpEx and CapEx. You can see we laid that out one of our supplemental scheduled - our supplemental schedule 6, where we show all the different components of R&M and turn both OpEx and CapEx wise. And we're certainly trending to a number that will be over $3,000 for the year. We feel long-term that that $2,600 - $2,800 number is the right number. And with the challenges that we've had this year, and the steps of Charles talked about very specifically of what we're doing to go after that. We're confident, we certainly see that get better as we go into the future, but for this year it is going to be elevated number unfortunately. But we feel like, we've got the plan in place to get that better as we go forward.
Steve Sakwa: And I know, you're not giving 2019 guidance, but just given some of the challenges you had this year and those seem to be getting corrected. I mean, is it higher likelihood that that number could drift down lower next year or higher CapEx costs that are potentially keeping that number elevated next year?
Ernest Freedman: Yeah. We will be carefully into specific as we continue to work through the plants, Steve. I would expect in the first part of the year, it will be more challenging, the second part of the year or next year, because it will be as we're working through these want to make sure they're working. But do be able to say what will offset versus what should be higher, it will get into those kind of details on our next call, we're prepared to talk about guidance, but be a little premature right now.
Steve Sakwa: Okay. And then just lastly on the balance sheet management anything that we should be thinking about in terms of pre-payments or kind of just straight debt pay down as we think about kind of the mix of debt changing over the next 12-months?
Ernest Freedman: Yeah, well, Dallas talked about the fact that you know in closing these bulk sales that we have in most of those close in October as we disclose in the release. There will be opportunity for a pre-payment, and the pre-payment associated with that. So that will be occurring. And then folks may know where we're in the market, we priced a securitization last week scheduled to close this week will provide the details on that once that closes. That's a refinancing activity to take out some debt that's maturing the near-term and extending to much longer-term. And again, we'll provide the details on that once the closing happens later this week. Generally then we'll just continue to look for using excess cash flow and if we end up being another seller using those proceeds deep and further delever the balance sheet similar to what we've done here for the last two years.
Steve Sakwa: Okay. Thanks a lot. That's it for me.
Ernest Freedman: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jade Rahmani of KBW.
Jade Rahmani: Just a follow-up on the CapEx question. What drove the spike in the recurring CapEx year-over-year?
Ernest Freedman: Well, it's a seasonal, Jade. So we certainly saw that goes up in the third quarter, and typically starts to go up in the second quarter. So you see the number certainly is typically at its highest as you get into the third quarter, you're catching up from activities started in June and then of course July and August a big turnover month. So it's really more seasonality thing than anything else so that drove the higher numbers of that you've seen throughout the year.
Jade Rahmani: Have you looked at it on the Same Store basis on a year-over-year basis to see what the specific drivers are?
Ernest Freedman: Both Jade, it's really more of the broadly around the challenges we talked about the past around on R&M, the fact that it was until later into the summer in late June into July. We saw those challenges and start addressing those. So on a Same Store basis, whether you're looking at where the asset came from portfolio or not, it's just generally across the board, because of the challenges we talked about before.
Jade Rahmani: And can you just remind me what the challenges are? I guess, specifically as you can.
Dallas Tanner: I think, Jade, we've gone through those in excruciating detail that Ernie and Charles talked about here some more terms what we're doing to address those, but let me turn it over to Charles.
Charles Young: Yes. As we mentioned in Q2 call, it's really around our in-house tech utilization and trying to get that number up, where we expected to be. As I talked about on the opening remarks, we've implemented a number of recent enhancements that will further improve in fine tune the platform. I'll highlight three things, one is our internal tech scheduling around optimization, program this looks to optimize the in-house tech routing to minimize drive time. We think that's going to add to our efficiency of our in-house techs. The second is the vendor management program, we call this our vendor scorecard. This will prove the vendor accountability by tracking of our performance, cost efficiency and customer service. And overall, we think this will easily compare performance of all vendors and identify the strongest performers and this is a real win for the resident. And then lastly, most importantly, I brought this up on the comments as well is, we're getting to a consolidated instance of the R&M platform. Just starts to unlock, our scale and density, and gives us real benefits. Simplifying the management of the maintenance operations work through a single platform, unifies reporting. So we can see the field teams can easily report under a single umbrella. As we talked about where our goal here is to up the in-house tech utilizations, our efficiency gets better by having that one platform, where we can see the visibility, our management teams can work from take advantage of the home density that we have and you couple that with routing optimization. We get some real benefits there. And lastly that same benefit is applied to our vendors, so a lot - that allows us to be more efficient with our vendors. So that's what we're doing what we just recently enhanced and put in place. What's next, we have more to come as we get to the consolidated instance of the platform of Dallas talked about. And we're going to further expand on our ProCare offerings, which will be a benefit in 2019 as well.
Jade Rahmani: And I guess so there's a specific cost categories that have been an outsized driver of the increased CapEx?
Ernest Freedman: Jade, we're not going to give any more details than we have at this point. So happy to talk to you offline if you want to talk about it some more, but I think we've addressed our previous call and certainly to this call and to previous questions items with regard to the R&M side.
Jade Rahmani: Okay. And lastly American homes rent recently announced a joint venture with the increased institutional interest in the single-family rental space and a lot of new entrants and the eye buyer base. Is that something you might be looking to do? And also, could you comment on interest from homebuilders, whether there is increased desire to partner with them?
Dallas Tanner: Good question, Jade. And we're always having conversations with homebuilders around specific opportunities. And we've mentioned a number of times, that we're really channel agnostic. We'll look for opportunities where they're meaningful. But we care about being location specific at the end of the day. We really want to be focused on being in-fill, higher barrier-to-entry parts of the sub-markets, where we know there's some of that enhanced demand like we're seeing in our numbers today. And so, for us, it's really about being more in the right locations. We've certainly seen some of those opportunities. And we're open-minded to potential partnerships that, say, present themselves in parts of markets, where we have an intention to invest.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks very much.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks.
Operator: And the next question comes from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank.
Derek Johnston: Good afternoon. Since your West Coast markets have been strong, do you mind giving us another update on Costa-Hawkins ahead of the vote, and if there are any steps you can take on a municipal level, if it gets repealed? And if so, how would your game-plan change in California?
Dallas Tanner: Hi, thanks for the question. We're not going to get too much into it, given that today is the voting day in California - or tomorrow, excuse me. Let's see how that plays out. We've commented on it a number of times. And we're obviously supportive of being [known on prop 10] [ph] for a variety of different reasons. But we hate to comment on it today, being so close.
Derek Johnston: Okay. How about the low turnover in the portfolio this quarter? So given the market backdrop with higher rates, do you anticipate this developing into more of a favorable turnover trend? Or is it more of a one-off or seasonality driven event?
Charles Young: Yeah, I won't - this is Charles. I won't jump into what's going to happen in 2019. But as we look at this, our residents continue to enjoy our well-located homes and quality service. We've had a good year on turnover. A lot of it's just been around the consolidation of our offices and using best practices from both organizations. As we continue to mature and constantly improve, we expect the residents are going to want to stay with us longer. So I don't want to put specific numbers on it. We like the trend. And we're going to keep working hard to keep it as low as possible.
Derek Johnston: Okay. And lastly for me, is there any update on the rollout of the Smart Home technology in 3Q? You guys have been at it for a while now.
Charles Young: Yeah. We've had good results. We've been rolling it across both portfolios. We have - about a third of our portfolio has a Smart Home technology installed. Again, it gives us benefits in terms of operating efficiencies, in terms of vendors being able to get in the home and start showing options for our residents. And the ability to create ancillary revenue, about 14,000 of our residents are paying about $18 a month for the service. And we - as Dallas said, we look at adding on additional services in the future, whether that's in regards to cameras, security and other items that we think we can grow. At a baseline though, we just want to roll out the Smart Home that has a lock in the thermostat that we have now and we're making good inroads in terms of getting it across the portfolio.
Derek Johnston: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from Ryan Gilbert of BTIG.
Ryan Gilbert: Hi, thanks, guys. Has the recent increase in resell inventory impacted or pressured your ability to drive rent growth? And I'm just kind of trying to reconcile your positive commentary around demand with the negative spread and blended rent in the quarter.
Dallas Tanner: I'm not sure I'm following the end of your question. But I'll just comment quickly on your question around month of supply. Current month of supply on a national basis is right around 4 in a quarter in terms of months, in terms of months that are on market. We have not seen - and we know that there's been a little bit of slowdown in some of the homebuilding numbers, and certainly, in transaction counts on a resale basis. But as we look back on a look-back basis across our portfolio in terms of home-price appreciation as well as how that's tied into our blended rent growth, we're still seeing really strong numbers. In Seattle for example, we're seeing over 12% in terms of home price appreciation. Las Vegas has also been around 12% to 13%. So we haven't seen that slowdown in terms of what that's doing for demand. I'll let Ernie comment a bit more on rate. But generally speaking, we recognize that we're in a seasonally slower period in terms of new home purchasing. It typically slows down after Labor Day for a couple of months. We look at that as a good opportunity for us on the margin to be a buyer. But it hasn't affected demand. In fact, otherwise were some of the best occupancy we've been at to date.
Ernest Freedman: Yeah, Dallas is absolutely right. We certainly have seen year-over-year that last year our blended rent achievement, was higher than this year. But that gap has narrowed all throughout the year. So actually, September is the narrowest it's been, where it's only 20 basis points different. And we talked about in October how it's actually flattened out. I don't want to project what that means for November, December or to early part of the year. Basically, what that tells us is it's very similar fundamental backdrop for us to be able to operate in. And as we operate more and more effectively, residents are staying with us longer, turnover is down. We've been able to hit the market and achieve rental rates that we think are pretty good. So we feel good where things are at. We think the background from a fundamental perspective should allow us to continue to do well.
Ryan Gilbert: So, I guess, so maybe the negative spread here is more leaning into occupancy than focusing on driving rent in 2018.
Dallas Tanner: I guess, I'm not following the question. The occupancy is certainly up year-over-year. And we've again narrowed the spreads from - it's not a new story, over the last many quarters, where the year before was a little bit higher. So I think the difference is we're actually seeing that spread narrow, at the same time being able to do from an occupancy perspective. So I'm not following what your question is.
Ryan Gilbert: No, I think that makes sense. Thanks. And then on repairs and maintenance, do you have the percentage of work-orders that went to internal techs versus third-party vendors in the third quarter, maybe how that compares to the second quarter?
Charles Young: Yeah, we're trending in the low 40% of in-house tech utilization today. That's up from where we were based on the adjustments we made in Q2, when we consolidate into one platform. These recent enhancements that I described, we expect to start to bring that number up into the mid and upper parts of the 40s. But it's early. We're not to track it. We just implemented these enhancements and we want to try to get as close to 50% as we can. But it's a process and it's going to take time. The real test is going to be how do we do next year in peak season. And this is seasonal too. As you get to peak season, there is some up and down. So it's hard to go and quote just a number right now, because it does go up and down based on demand and turnover, and the seasonality that comes with the warm weather.
Dallas Tanner: Yeah, we don't staff necessarily all the things that we need to do in peak season, because it would be inefficient during non-peak season. So Charles is exactly in that right. We're just trying clear one quarter to the next. It may provide a false indication of what the trend is. You really got to look it over longer periods as Charles talked about.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. Do you have how that compares to the third quarter of last year maybe then, so we can try and back out…?
Dallas Tanner: We're two different companies last year, we weren't even merged last year at this time. So that comparison we're not able to do.
Charles Young: And we had different staffing levels on the number of in-house techs that we had. So it's really difficult to create the comparison.
Ryan Gilbert: All right, fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dallas Tanner, for any closing remarks.
Dallas Tanner: We appreciate everybody's support. And we look forward to talking to everyone over the next couple of days. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

I'd like to point everyone to our second quarter 2018 earnings press release and supplemental information, which we may reference on today's call. This document can be found on the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.invh.com. I'd also like to inform you that certain statements made during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We described some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2017 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from the time-to-time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. During this call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these new measures with the most comparable GAAP measures, in our earnings release and supplemental information, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our Web site. I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Fred Tuomi.
Fred Tuomi: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Supply and demand fundamentals remain strong in our high growth markets, which enable us to achieve 4.5% year-over-year same store core revenue growth in the second quarter, a full 40 basis points better than the first quarter's growth rate of 4.1%. Same store average occupancy for the quarter of 96% was the highest achieved over the last six quarters as turnover once again declined relative to the prior year. At the same time, blended rent growth remains strong at 4.7%. This robust top-line growth help drive year-over-year same store NOI growth of 5% and core FFO per share growth of 19.3%. Looking ahead, new housing supply remains muted and key indicators point to continued strong demand. In our select high growth markets, household formations are forecast to grow at a rate 90% greater than U.S. average for 2018. Home prices in our markets are up almost 7% year-over-year. Higher construction costs are constraining new supply and move-outs to home ownership continue to track lower than last year. All of these key factors point to continued strength and revenue growth for the second half of 2018, and demographics in the U.S. have only become more beneficial in the years ahead as the millennial generation continues to age. Based on year-to-date results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are maintaining the midpoint of full year’s 2018 same-store core revenue growth guidance, while narrowing the range to 4.3% to 4.7%. We’re also pleased to report that the majority of integration milestones are now complete, allowing us to estimate merger synergies with greater certainty. We now expect total run rate cost synergies to be between $50 million and $55 million, which is $5 million greater than our initial expectations. While we are excited about our revenue growth outlook and these additional long term cost savings property level expenses are temporarily running a higher than expected. Charles will address this in greater detail. However, I’ll summarize it by saying that we were overly optimistic in how quickly we would realize service technician productivity gains from our newly integrated Repair and Maintenance or R&M management technology, and it will take longer than we initially thought to fully optimize this area. Accordingly, we are updating our full year 2018 same-store expense growth guidance to 4.6% to 5.4%. Let me be clear that we do not view these projected 2018 expense numbers as normalized nor as representative of any fundamental change in the business. We would not be changing our previous 2018 same-store expense or NOI guidance, if not for these temporary challenges. Given our updated revenue and expense expectations, we now forecast full year 2018 same-store NOI growth of between 3.8% and 4.8%. Importantly, we are maintaining the midpoint of our 2018 core FFO guidance and narrowing the range to $1.15 to $1.19 per share, which represents 13% growth versus last year at this midpoint. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to focus on widening our competitive advantages in the single-family rental marketplace. The first is locations. We believe we are already in the most desirable high growth single family rental markets and have carefully selected our homes to be closed-in high barrier sub markets with proximity to employment centers, good schools and transportation corridors. With our substantially increased market density post merger, our investment management team is now leveraging even more robust data and analytics to further refine our locations through ongoing capital recycling. In the first half of 2018, we reallocated approximately $130 million of capital from lower rated homes and sub-markets into more attractive homes and sub-markets through acquisitions and dispositions. Second competitive advantage we are focused on is scale. With almost 5,000 homes per market on average, we expect to provide even higher quality service to a greater number of homes with the optimal number of personnel. The next phase of our integration will be focused on bringing all of that to fruition as we roll out our new unified field structure and unique operating platform to leverage our increased scale and density. The third advantage is our people and service, which we also expect to benefit from the next phase of this integration. As mentioned, we have completed the process of moving all of our field technicians and vendors on to one R&M management technology platform. In the second half of the year, we will be implementing even more advanced tools and expanding the ProCare best practices aimed at improving both the resident experience and the efficiency with which we provide it. Looking further ahead, we also see an opportunity to expand into new products and services that residents will desire and value such as our current smart home technology offering. We remain excited about the growth prospects with this business in both the near term and the long term, and are focused on continuing to leverage our competitive advantages for the benefit of our residents, associates and shareholders. With that, Charles Young, our Chief Operating Officer, will now provide more detail on our operating results in the second quarter as well as current operating trends.
Charles Young: Thank you, Fred. I’d like to start by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication. We continue to enjoy strong market fundamentals but growth doesn't come without execution and that all starts with resident service. Our teams are providing residents with a high quality living experience as evidenced by further improvement in turnover rate to 34.4% on a trailing 12 months basis. Resident satisfactions scores also remain high, averaging 4.3 out of 5 over 10,000 survey responses we have received year-to-date on residents regarding quality of services. Our dedicated field teams are committed to earnings the loyalty of our residents every day. I'll now spend some time walking you through the details of our second quarter 2018 operating performance. Same store core revenues in the second quarter grew 4.5 year-over-year in line with our expectation and up from 4.1% in the first quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by average rental rate growth of 4% and 20 basis points in average occupancy to 96% for the quarter. These strong top-line results drove same store NOI growth of 5% despite higher than expected expense growth of 3.6%. Non-controllable expenses were in line with expectations. However, R&M expenses were higher than expected for the quarter due primarily to overages in June, mostly concentrated in two markets. I'd like to take a few moments to discuss the primary drivers of elevated R&M expense that were identified and the steps we are taking to improve our results. There are two key issues we are facing; first, the markets specific challenges stemming from disruption to our local teams associated with integration; and second, our temporary challenges we are experiences as we adapt to a newly implemented R&M Management Technology platform. First, I'll touch on the market specific issues. The vast majority of our markets have seen very limited associate challenges through the integration process. However, Tampa and South Florida have experienced the higher level of personnel issues that have been detrimental to performance. These two markets alone accounted for 44% of the overall R&M miss versus our expectations in the second quarter. We have responded by moving swiftly to supplement and rebuild teams in these markets. We have also committed additional national resources to these two local offices to help restore performance to expected levels. Second, I'll turn to the areas of opportunity with our new R&M Management Technology platform. The implementation of this technology was completed ahead of schedule during the second quarter and overtime we are confident that we'll further increase service technical productivity. However, in retrospect we were too optimistic in our initial expectations and assuming we would realize those productivity gains immediately. In fact, productivity temporarily declined out of the gate. This issue was amplified by the fact that we completed the rollout at a time when work order volume was seasonally the highest. We've already taken specific actions to restore and improve service technician productivity. For example, we have updated our service call center dispatch scripts and logic that determine who is best equipped and position to address work orders in real time, which will improve the percentage of work orders completed in house. In addition, we are nearing the rollout of a new version of our route optimization algorithm, which will improve the metric of daily average work orders completed per technician. As systems are fine-tuned and fully adopted, we expect to achieve even higher efficiency than in the past due to our enhanced scale, density, experience and technology. However, we have reset our expectations to assume that it will take longer -- take more time to get there. Our revised guidance assumes that the challenges we’ve been experiencing will likely persist through the second half of the year, but we are working hard to do better and faster. Next, I’ll cover second quarter 2018 recent trends. Same-store average occupancy was 96% in the second quarter, best in the last six quarters. Same-store blended rent growth, which we define as lease-over-lease rent growth net of any concession incentive averaged 4.7% in the second quarter, driven by a seasonal acceleration and new lease rent growth to 4.8% and continued steady strength and renewal rent growth of 4.7%. Furthermore, we saw acceleration into quarter end with renewals increasing to 4.8% in June from 4.6% in May and new leases increasing the 5.5% in June from 4.5% in May. Western U.S. markets continue to lead the way for growth with Seattle, Phoenix, Northern and Southern California remaining our highest. Even with strong rent growth, turnover trends continue to be favorable, declining to 9.4% in the second quarter 2018 from 10% in the second quarter 2017. We believe this is a testament to the value that residents continue to find in our first class service and high quality homes and highly desirable locations. And the strong leasing environment has continued into the third quarter. The year-over-year occupancy gains accelerated to 40 basis points in July with average occupancy coming in at 95.4% for the month versus 95% in July 2017. Blended net effective rent growth was 4.7% in July with renewal steady at 4.8% and new leases of 4.6% meeting our expectation as we near the end of peak leasing season. I will close by expressing my excitement for all of the opportunities in front of us operationally in the second half of the year. We remain focused everyday on delivering the leasing lifestyle our residents desire while optimizing rent growth and occupancy to capture strong market fundamentals. We’re working hard to restore and ultimately further improve R&M efficiency. And as integration nears the final phase, we’ll rollout more enhancements that’ll make our teams even better equipped to provide an outstanding level service for our residents. I’ll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Ernie Freedman.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today, I will cover the following topics; portfolio activity for the second order; balance sheet and capital markets activity; financial results for the second quarter; integration update; and 2018 guidance update. I’ll start with portfolio activity. As we continue to recycle capital to further enhance the quality of our portfolio, total home count decreased by 85,000 to 82,424 homes. We bought 263 homes for an estimated $80 million and sold 348 homes for $77 million, keeping us on track for our full year plan of acquisitions and dispositions each in the range of $300 million to $500 million. The average cap rate on homes we acquired was 5.5%. Net investment was focused in the Western U.S. into a lesser extent the Southeast, funded by net dispositions primarily in Chicago, South Florida and Houston. I'll now turn to an update of our balance sheet and capital markets activity. Debt markets continue to provide attractive refinancing opportunities in the second quarter. We took advantage by completing two seven-year securitizations; one in May, with principal amount of $1.1 billion at LIBOR plus 138; and one in June, with principal amount of $1.3 billion at LIBOR plus 142. Net proceeds and cash on hand were used to prepay $2.3 billion of floating rate securitizations maturing in 2020 and $200 million of floating rate securitization debt maturing in 2021. Since the beginning of the year, our weighted average maturity has increased to 5.4 years from 4.1 years and our unencumbered pool of assets has grown by over 10% to approximately 38,600 homes. We also entered into additional forward interest rate swaps to extend the duration of our hedges to match the extended duration of our maturities. We've added schedule 2D to our supplemental to provide additional detail related to expected changes in our weighted average cost of debt over time based on our current debt and interest rate swaps in place. And finally, our liquidity at quarter end was almost $1.2 billion through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facility. I'll now touch briefly on our second quarter 2018 financial results. Core FFO and AFFO per share for the second quarter increased 19.3% and 14.5% year-over-year respectively to $0.29 and $0.24. The primary drivers of the increases were growth in NOI per share in addition to lower adjusted G&A and lower cash interest expense per share. Supplemental schedule one provides reconciliation from GAAP net loss to our reported FFO, core FFO and AFFO. I'll next provide an update on our merger integration. We are ahead of schedule on most major elements of the integration. Office space in 15 of our 17 local markets has now been consolidated. Implementation of our new R&M technology is complete and our new accounting platform was launched on August 1st. As a result, the pace of synergy achievement is also running ahead of schedule by approximately $10 million versus where we had expected to be at this point. As of today, we have earned an approximately $34 million of synergies on an annualized run rate basis, almost entirely related to G&A and property management. Implementation of our unified operating platform and field configuration that combines the best of both legacy organizations is our final remaining major milestone. Work under systems and technology to support this unified platform continues to progress and roll out to the field is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2018. The last thing I will cover is updated 2018 guidance. For the same store portfolio, we are narrowing our core revenue growth guidance to 4.3% to 4.7%, unchanged at the midpoint as fundamentals in our markets continue to be favorable. Our same-store NOI guidance is now 3.8% to 4.8% due to an increase in our same-store core expense guidance to 4.6% to 5.4%. I'll give some additional detail to help bridge the increase in our same-store expense guidance. Our initial 2% to 3% same-store operating expense guidance for 2018 assumed R&M costs would be lower in 2018 than they were in 2017 due to anticipated productivity gains. As Charles described though productivity instead declined out of the gate and is expected to take more time to optimize. For this reason alone, we now expect property level expenses excluding taxes to be up 3.5% year-over-year versus down 1% in our initial guidance. Real estate taxes are still expected to increase about 6.5% this year consistent with our initial guidance. 3.5% growth on non-tax expenses and 6.5% growth in real estate expenses leads to 5% overall expense growth, which is the midpoint of our revised guidance range. And remember, we have a material increase in our property taxes in 2018 from onetime Crop 13 related reassessments in California due to our merger. Without that increase our new 5% same store expense growth expectation would instead be 4.25%. As Fred mentioned, we've also raised our expectation for total annual run-rate synergies to between $50 million and $55 million. This is $5 million higher than our initial projection primarily due to incremental cost savings we've been able to drive in the areas of vendor and subscription services within G&A. Taking into account our revised expectations for same store results and synergy obtainment, we are maintaining the midpoint of our full year 2018 core FFO guidance and narrowing its range to $1.15 and $1.19 per share. Additional favorable changes in our forecast include lower expected interest expense and G&A. In summary, our full year core FFO and AFFO guidance at their midpoints imply growth rate of 13% and 10% respectively from prior year. I'll close by reiterating that our teams are energized and excited for the second half of 2018. Big picture fundamentals remain very strong and we are making great progress on the priorities we laid out at the beginning of the year. With that operator, would you please open up the line for questions?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And today's first question will come from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Just hoping if we could talk a little bit about same store revenue. The guidance implies a modest reacceleration at the midpoint in the second half. Are you comfortable at the midpoint and what's driving that uptick in the second half? Is that driven by occupancy and the rate as part of that how should we think about the impact of the hurricanes last year?
Ernie Freedman: As you saw, we accelerated our revenue growth from the first quarter to the second quarter from 4.1% growth rate of 4.5% growth rate. As you look at the second half of the year and as we've talked about in the past, we do have easier comps with regards to occupancy. And in fact in the month of July alone, we're 40 bps higher year-over-year. So we get a little more benefit out of occupancy with regards to having easier comp. And we expect to have good rental growth rate as well in the second half. But with the easier occupancy comp, we do believe that we will get to that 4.3% to 4.7% range with regards to our revenue for the full year.
Juan Sanabria: And the hurricanes, does that make the comps easier in the fourth quarter, or how should we think about that last year?
Charles Young: So bottom line is part of the occupancy bottom line that Ernie talked about is that it's a little lower in the fourth quarter. And that will give us a little bit of a lift as we comp against it. So the hurricane pickup really started to come back in occupancy in the first part of this year. And we had some slowdown in leasing because of the hurricane in both Houston and Florida. So that’s some of the comp benefit that we have.
Juan Sanabria: And then on the expense side, you talked about sounds like higher employee turnover in Florida. Is there anything you can attribute that to? Is it just people moving for higher wages? And do you expect more wage pressure going forward?
Charles Young: No, it really wasn’t about wage pressure. As a reminder, as we said in the opening remarks, 15 of our 17 offices have already combined and we’re really operating great across the majority of our markets. The Florida issues are truly isolated, specifically the two markets in Tampa and South Florida. And was around associate turnover, not really about wage and it was more around the integration. So we had a few unexpected early departures and a couple of key roles that created a distraction for us. And at the time that it happened at the peak work order volume that was part of the impact. The good news is though, we’ve backfilled quickly, we’re supporting the teams with national resources and we expect to get back on track for the second half of the year.
Operator: Next question comes from Douglas Harter with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Douglas Harter: Just on correcting those two markets, can you just remind us what is in your guidance for the back half, as far as pace of addressing those markets and then just help us think about the potential magnitude of -- as you get those address what 2019 could look like with that improvement?
Ernie Freedman: I understand when we have challenges in R&M, most of our R&M activity happens in the peak season, in the peak summer season. And so our opportunity to improve becomes smaller and smaller and it get to the end of the year. So it’s less work orders coming through the system, that’s across all of our markets. And so we do expect that these markets will get better by the end of the year, but it won’t have as meaningful impact as we would like, because there’s work orders on spread out evenly throughout the second half of the year. So our guidance does assume we continue to have challenges during the peak leasing season -- of course in peak service season, of course we’ll try to do better than that. But I want to make clear we talked about in the prepared remarks that our expectations around that is that baked into our are guidance is those issues will get resolved but it’s going to take well into the end of the year to make sure and then we’re into our best to see if we can do better than that.
Douglas Harter: And then Ernie, the refinancing that you did in the second quarter, and I guess do you have any other debt that -- where you could see comparable savings given where the financing markets are today?
Ernie Freedman: We do have -- we’re able to get ahead of some of our refinancing activity for maturities that were coming up in 2019, and the capital markets team here did a fantastic job executing for us. We do have 2020 and 2021 maturities there couple years out. But those could be good opportunities for us to consider some refinancing activity as against the latter half of this year or the beginning of next year where we could see some spread compression there as well. So we’ll be optimistic like we’ve been. We’re pleased before the balance sheet is at. We’re pleased with the fact that we’ve been able to extend our weighted average maturity. But we’re very committed to getting to where we want to as investment great balance sheet. And so the answer is -- and we could do some stuff here in the second half of the year. But at this point, we’re pretty pleased with what we’ve accomplished thus far, Doug.
Operator: Next question comes from Jason Green with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Jason Green: Just wanted to circle back on same-store expenses, it looks like looking at your guidance and what you did for the first half of the year that you do expect some slight acceleration in same-store expenses in the back half of the year. And I was wondering if that's more to the fact that there is more R&M spending, Q3 versus the other quarters, or if there's some other factors there?
Ernie Freedman: Yes, the two things with regards of our guidance. First is what we did say that in the third quarter, we'll have the most spend of between the two quarters and certainly this happened in the past so we'd expect that again. And the other thing is remember we had a more difficult comp in the fourth quarter. And you recall we had some things meet over to the first quarter this year with regards to R&M from some of those markets that were impacted by the hurricanes. Most of the R&M activity that was occurring in the fourth quarter in those markets was related to hurricane cleanup, and was not pull into R&M. So we actually had a lighter R&M number in the fourth quarter 2017 because of that creating a slightly more difficult comp for us in 2018. Hence you're exactly right. If you look at our guidance, year-to-date, we're at 4.3% but our guidance for the full year is 4.6 to 5.4. So that's why you see that trend as we go into the second half of the year.
Jason Green: And then on the renewal front, renewals are obviously still strong but they're down 60 basis points year-over-year. And I guess if you could compare the difference in push back with tenants this time around versus last year and what might be driving any of the pushback that would be helpful?
Fred Tuomi: It's not as much about, this Charles -- it's not as much around pushback from tenants. Pricing power remained strong, supply and demand fundamentals are favorable and our demographics long-term are going to be tailwind to us. As we look at rent growth and it being slightly lower year-over-year, it's less about fundamentals and more really around the seasoning of our portfolio. If we did the bulk of our buying early on, we were focused on getting the homes leased. In the last couple of years, Dallas and team have done a wonderful job of optimizing. And we're really seeing more of a true up to market, which contributed to early on higher rents. But where we are now, we're stabilizing and we've been very consistent at 4.8 to 5. And we think that's reflective of where we are in market fundamentals for each of our markets across the country.
Operator: Next question comes from Drew Babin with Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: I was hoping to talk about the difference in the revisions to FFO and AFFO guidance it looks like there is probably increased recurring CapEx expenses in there. And I was curious why that is, is that higher materials cost? Does that have anything to do with the same factors that drove repair and maintenance costs higher in the second quarter?
Ernie Freedman: Drew, it's actually the latter of what you described. A lot of the impacts we see in repairs was OpEx where we're seeing the same challenge than as it carries over to repairs in maintenance CapEx. So we're not seeing a material change in our costs or anything like that in turn. But we are seeing that for the similar reasons with some of the challenges in those couple markets that Charles talk about that we're seeing that pressure on our CapEx, and wanted to make sure we reflected that in our guidance going forward specific for our capital replacement spending, which impacts to AFFO.
Drew Babin: And then also too I was hoping you could clarify what markets are now unencumbered by debt and the potential to possibly sell a market to a private bidder either later this year and next year potentially to repay debt? And I was just hoping you can comment on what those markets are and what the prospects are for something like that?
Ernie Freedman: Drew, no market is unencumbered completely by debt, but some markets certainly have a lower proportion of unencumbered debt than others, and that generally is an issue for us when we go to sell assets. With regards to all of us securitizations, almost all of them only have a one year lockout where there we have to pay yield maintenance on the floating rate securitizations. There is a couple of that two year, but they're almost at their point in time at where they expire. So other than our most recent refinancing activity that won’t be a difference to us and we have substitution rights in all those deals too. So we also have that flexibility there. Similarly, we do have flexibility with our Fannie Mae transaction as well for substitution rates. So if we did want to sale market that wouldn't a hindrance for us with regards to how our debt as far as to have the ability to do that. 
Drew Babin: And then just a related question. How would you view the bid right now for portfolio transactions in this business?
Dallas Tanner: Drew, this is Dallas. Generally, we're seeing a ton of demand in marketplace when we -- even on the limited amount of dispositions we've done this year taking something out. You'll find that there are lot of new entrants into the space today that are looking to try to acquire scale, it's pretty difficult given today's environment. So the simple answer would be that we see that mark-to-market pretty tight it’s some over to come to market with a decent opportunity. It's just also dependent upon asset quality and the types of rents you're getting out of those homes today. So for us you look at some of our disposition activity this year, we've certainly been more active selling assets and parts of markets where we're not seeing as much growth. Now we expect that to stay consistent with our strategy going forward.
Operator: And next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: So Fred or Charles maybe this one is for you, a question again on the expense, the hike in the guidance, which is a surprise to many of us. I recall chatting with you guys at NAREIT and we focused quite a bit on the strong rental growth that was going on, and how you felt good about your 2018 guidance. So I guess I'm curious if you want to wear these integration and expense headwinds at that time. And if so maybe why wasn't that more of a mention of it?
Charles Young: So NAREIT we had visibility into April and May at the time. June is really where we had the surprise. We have finished the integration into the R&M maintenance technology platform. And that's where we quickly saw that there was -- we were offering our in house tech utilization. So we quickly made the pivot as we talked about. And part of the challenge is that time of year its high volume and it's had an impact. So that's why we didn't see it there and ultimately we're making the pivot and we think we're going to work our way through this at the end of the year, we'll be in good shape going into '19.
Haendel St. Juste: And then just a follow up on the dispositions, I didn't catch a cap rate. I think you mentioned 5.5 on what you thought. So maybe can you tell me the cap rate there and any markets -- is there any markets?
Ernie Freedman: So I can answer that for you Haendel. So in terms of cap rate it was 0.7%, all of our sales in the second quarter were through the end user retail channel where the home typically we vacate for a month to two months, maybe a little longer sometimes. So that's why you typically see a much lower cap rate when we sale those homes. If we were to start selling some more homes to the bulk channel, you'll see a cap rate to be at a certainly higher number and more in line with where they’re buying homes, in the second quarter it's 0.7%. And with the number of homes that we sold, we did not exit any markets. But Dallas could talk about where we concentrated some of those sales.
Dallas Tanner: We've had a number of sales in Huston throughout this year and also Chicago. And we're really in line with some of the guidance we laid out early in the year in terms of where we want to be selling. Ernie talked about it earlier on the call. We anticipate we'll sale somewhere between $400 million and $500 million with the homes this year, and we're on target to achieve those targets.
Haendel St. Juste: A quick one on Houston since you mentioned that was one of the weaker revenue growth markets. Anything in particular you want to note that's going on there lingering impacts of -- well, I'll let you explain. But can you give us a sense as to what's going on in Houston?
Charles Young: Really it's around supply challenges related to our owned and other product from post-Harvey coming back online. Occupancies stepped up temporarily when there was a void of housing as those homes were being rehab. We had around 130 come-in in the first and second quarter back online. So it creates a little bit of a supply issue for us and then other homes coming in as well as we’re trying to compete against that. So put some pressure on our new lease growth and we’ll continue to have a little bit of that as we absorb. Going into the second half of the year, we expect we’ll catch back-up now that volume is at peak season.
Operator: Next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: So at NAREIT with three weeks to go in the quarter, R&M and personnel related issues pop-up. So if R&M costs are up 15% for the quarter suggests they’re massively in last three weeks of the quarter. So I guess how do you get comfortable that with that little visibility with three weeks left to a quarter. How do you get comfortable with personnel related issues, or call center queue scripts aren’t going to pop-up in September or October?
Ernie Freedman: We have to react to the information as in front of us and we reacted quickly. On the R&M side, specifically, the call scripts are just part of what we are reacting to. And part of the issue is it’s the volume of work that’s coming through that time of year and our ability to make those pivot. So July also is high volume, it’s actually the highest volume. August is high and then we start to step down. So some part of the challenges when you make the adjustments it takes some minutes to get through the system. And we have further enhancements that we’re going to do. Ultimately, we talked about the in-house tech utilization, the call scripts is a big part of that. As we go through the remaining field office consolidations, we’re going to unlock more of that strength. The maintenance tech productivity is another one that we’re going to roll in here shortly with the route optimization algorithms. So that’ll get the number of work orders that our in-house tech can do each day will help. And then ProCare, its part of what’s not in the system right now, huge part, very beneficial. But one of the main benefits is the bundling of work orders that we do in that post 45-day move-in, that’s not only convenient for the resident but it’s sufficient for our tech and our ability. So there’s more to be worked in. Ultimately, as you put the systems together we made the initial step but we think we’re going to see more benefits long-term.
John Pawlowski: The actual implementation and a lot of the integration in the field level is going to happen in the back half of ‘18 and early ‘19. So are you comfortable that the personnel in the field are safer than the Tampa and South Florida markets were the past month? How do you get comfortable with that?
Charles Young: As mentioned, 15 out of 17 offices are already consolidated. The go forward leaders in place we’re working well with things across all those. Like we said, we were isolated to a couple of markets that had impact. And since these teams are working well together and the fact that we’ve already implemented the maintenance technology platform, the rollout on the second half of the year should be much smoother. We’re going to be very thoughtful about how we do it in terms of implementing measured rollout and look slower seasonality season of Q4 and Q1, both the multiple rounds of testing. And we had much of our training materials in place. So we really feel confident -- and frankly, the teams are ready. They’re excited and they’re ready to get to the new platform. So we think it’ll be a much cleaner and smoother rollout of the final integration.
John Pawlowski: Last one from me Charles, on the wildfires in California. I know some are popping up around the periphery of your portfolio. Do you have any initial estimate on how many homes either, one, could be damaged or two, benefit from displaced renters in the area? 
Charles Young: We're watching it closely. We know those fires move fast. We've identified about 105 homes that are in the vicinity and we're working closely to notify and pay attention. We don't know more than that right now but we're watching it very closely.
Operator: Next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Just wanted to maybe get an update from, if you could, on trends in July and early August, particularly on the revenue side, I think you've done a pretty good job of trying to address the expense side. But what are you seeing on the -- any trends that you can give us since the quarter end? I think maybe renewals or anything…
Ernie Freedman: So I think we highlighted in our script, the blended rental for July came in at 4.7%, renewals stayed steady about 4.8%. New leads growth of 4.6%, June was strong in new lease growth. But as we go into the end of the peak season, we want to make sure we maintain our occupancy and we did that. We moved up to 40 basis points relative to ’17 in July. And so we're paying attention to make sure we keep our occupancy and we still have strong demand now. And we want to maintain that through the rest of the year.
Rich Hill: And so as you think about occupancy versus pushing rate, you mentioned focusing on occupancy. Some of your multifamily second third cousins, if you will, have talked about maybe starting to push rate a little bit given where we are in the cycle and feeling a little bit more confident. Are you still prioritizing rate and occupancy the same way as previously, or you’re thinking about the change and how you're approaching that?
Ernie Freedman: Well, we're always trying to find the right optimization the balance of occupancy and rate. As we talked about, renewals are pretty steady throughout the year. It's a new lease growth that we try to take advantage of the summer months to maximize. But we've been through these cycles before and we're trying to pay attention to go into the slower leasing cycle fully occupied, which should allow us to keep some top line power in the slower months. But ultimately every quarter it's a balance of trying to find the right optimization between new lease growth and renewals.
Operator: Next question comes from Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please go ahead. 
Jade Rahmani: So your updated thoughts on Costa-Hawkins, where you think that's going to go and although it's hard to predict if it was repealed, how you would react?
FredTuomi: So Costa-Hawkins, I don't know how familiar people are. But that's the potential repeal of the Costa-Hawkins, which is a pretty -- additional new rent control laws in the State of California. And just stepping back almost every economist or housing policy expert across the country or perhaps even across the globe agree and have written many research studies that shows that the legal solution to a lack of affordable housing is not rent control but is to build more housing. We just need more supply when it's needed and most importantly where it's needed and the price points that it's needed. So they also agreed that rent control has proven to further just dampen the construction of new housing and the further investment of existing housing. So proposition tenant in California that potentially repeal this Costa-Hawkins legislation that's been in place since 1995 is just the wrong answer for California’s growing and long running and long developed housing shortage as it would likely make the situation worse, not only in the short run but over the long run. So it’s just bad policy, however, it's on the balance. And that the poles that we see they've been constantly testing the likely voter opinion on this are showing mixed results. So the November ballot is going to be close for sure but the industry and those on both sides of the issue will continue to make their case to the citizen of California. If it does pass, it doesn't mean that you're going to have statewide rent control. All that means is that the prohibition on rent control will be listed. So the jurisdictions that had rent control in the past will be able to update it and those that do not have it at all could choose to implement it. So it's going to be -- it will take a little long time for this to really reconcile. Each local jurisdiction is going to have to decide do they want to have rent control or not, and many of them will decide not to. And if they do, what's the flavor of it, what's going to look like, how is it going to be implemented. So if its top position tenant is defeated I think our industry will then take a step back and look we have to solve this problem together in cooperation with the legislature and try to find meaningful rational ways to just improve the situation in California that's taken many, many decades to develop. So when we look at our portfolio of homes across the state we're in Northern California and Southern California, we're not in really the hot beds of the rent control areas. We're not in the city of San Francisco or close by, we're not in Berkley, we're not in Santa Cruz, we're not in Santa Monica. So when we look at our portfolio, we think a very small proportion of our homes would be potentially egregiously affected and a very small portion of the Company's overall revenue. So we're just going to have to continue to watch it, see what happens in November and then we're prepared to react either way.
Jade Rahmani: And just on the final point you made. Can you give any percentages perhaps of those select markets where your homes could be impacted if it was repealed?
FredTuomi: We looked at that and again, it's just a theoretical assessment of likelihood of certain areas. There’s been some research some article on that. We think at the most it’s going to be around 15% of our portfolio might be impacted and again in California -- of the California homes, which is 12,000 homes total in California. And then there is no way of really estimating at this point to see revenue impact. Near term there really be none, I don't think that any areas will be rolling rents backwards mandating that. So it’d be a gradual shift. And then the other nice thing about single family rentals is that the if we had to, if long term prospects were such that there is a value diminution, one of the consequences of rent control is that existing home prices will be -- could to go up, because there is going to be another shortage of housing. There will be a lack of building of housing generally. So we could -- single family has the option of selling homes to homeowners on a one off prices if we choose to at very good pricing.
Jade Rahmani: And just in terms of broader demand trends, do you have any statistics you could share on the percentage of move outs to buy. I noticed an improvement in internal ratio, which we've seen in the industry and also home sales have declined. So do you think it’s a function of home sales declining in the market and some affordability constraints or anything else?
FredTuomi: Jade, similar to the first quarter, we've seen a year-over-year decline and the reason for move out around home purchases. Last year in the second quarter, it's about 27% of our move outs. This year it was 25.7%. So we’ve seen that trend now for two quarters in a row. And I think it's a little bit of all the above. But I think most importantly we have reason -- we also see our turnover going up, because residents are satisfied with the service that they're receiving from us. They like the homes that they're in. They're well located. They're convenient. And they’re seeing that in today’s economic environment, it’s even a better opportunity for maybe a better answer for them to stay in our homes.
Operator: Next question comes from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Ryan Gilbert: Just I guess following up on the last question, it seems like demand trends have stayed strong in July. I think we are seeing an increase in resell inventory in some markets, particularly in higher price point or higher home price appreciation markets. And I’m wondering if that -- if you’re seeing that impacting your ability to raise either new or re-leased rents or if it’s impacted your traffic or rental interest at all?
Dallas Tanner: In terms of demand, we haven’t seen any real change in the fundamentals. As Charles mentioned earlier, we’ve been able to go out to market at rates that are pretty aggressive, especially parts of the country where we own real estate. If you look at some of our numbers, for example, in the West Coast in quarter two and we had blended average rate growth of 6.5%, most of those markets are less than two months of supply on the MLS. And then as you start to look at some of the macro data in terms of price points and affordability with housing, in general, builders are developing much less inventory at 1,800 square feet or less in their current pipeline. It’s down somewhere from 33% in the late 90s to like 22% today. That is all favorable fundamentals for us in terms of how we think about the supply and demand factors benefiting our business. So we haven’t seen some of that necessarily in the markets that we’re in, because as a proxy for that growth we’re seeing it in the rents that we’re achieving. And Charles earlier point turnovers remain consistent at around 70% -- 30%.
Fred Tuomi: I think you maybe referring to Seattle as an example of very tight inventory, very high home price appreciation over the last several years. I think this got to a price point where people just couldn’t pursue homeownership in same numbers. But if you look at our portfolio in Seattle, the move outs for home purchasing actually is one of the markets that fell year-over-year. So again, it’s not impacting our level of the market, not impacting our demographic and people really enjoy the leasing lifestyle.
Ryan Gilbert: And then I guess regarding service tech productivity. Are you seeing a productivity improvement, I guess, quarter-to-date in the third quarter? And then it sounds like you’re expecting productivity to be back to levels that you expected going into the year by the end of 2018. I guess, what do you think the timeline is for achieving your initial productivity forecasts?
Charles Young: We expect to get back to our normal levels of productivity over the second half of the year here. We’re confident because both companies operated at that level before. But what also makes us excited is the combined power of our scale, density, the technology that we’re implementing and our experience, it’s a real advantage. What happens in the peak season here as we have the highest work order volume is, the productivity of the techs is not always at its highest and we’re at a place where we’re still as we put the technology and unlock all that and get the proximity and density advantages, that’s where we’ll have shorter distance between our homes for our techs to be able to do more work orders. So as I talked about before as we think about the route optimization software as we get to a unified operating platform second half of the year, that’s where we’ll start to see the real advantages to get back to our prior levels and possibly overachieve as we go into 2019.
Ryan Gilbert: And I guess just to follow-up. As you work on this on this issue, have you started seeing an improvement in the third quarter? Or do you think that's going to -- do you think the improvement of productivity is going to happen later in the third quarter and into the fourth?
Charles Young: We've already started to see the improvement with the changes that we made. But we know there's more that we're going to do and it's going to get even better.
Fred Tuomi: I would just add to that this platform is in place. We completed the implementation and integration across all of our markets, so that part is done. And when we initially noticed in June that the productivity measures on a daily basis we're starting to trend down instead of up, we were able to make some adjustments to the technology platform immediately. So Charles was able to get the team together, tweak some of the dispatch logic scripts and literally in the next day we could start seeing some improvement. So we're seeing gradual improvements but they have already begun. It's not that we have to retool, it’s just to adjust some of the parameters on this platform that impact things such as in-house dispatch, and then the route optimization certainly helps the other metrics of productivity such as the number of homes, the number of work order per tech per day.
Operator: Next question comes from Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Ivy Zelman: I just had a couple. One was could you share what the year-over-year increase in repair and maintenance expenses was by month, so we can get a sense for the cadence and how much you end up in June? 
Ernie Freedman: We're not going to provide monthly financial results, there is noise between months. Accruals get caught up, don't get caught up. So we're not prepared to provide that.
Ivy Zelman: On the inventory side just in terms of supply and just taking a step back and looking across your portfolio. Are there any markets where you anticipate supply over the next couple of years to pressure your pricing power, in particular some markets that you find less attractive than others?
Dallas Tanner: As I mentioned earlier certainly, not in our West Coast markets where we see really just incredible amount of demand for our products and very limited new supply. And the important part to remember is that you want to be higher barrier to entry, so that’s difficult for called new supply to enter into those sub-markets and parts of the market where we invest. It's in line with our -- price point around average rents being north of $1,700, those are typically properties that are located much higher barrier-to-entry. So in our markets, we don't see some of that. I'd be more concerned if we had massive exposure in Midwest and some of those areas, parts of the country where you have lower barrier to entries for, call it, new entrants and new development. But we don't have much of that in our portfolio, a little to none. So we’re pretty bullish in terms of the areas we’re in and being a bit insulated from some of those supply constraints. The only other thing I'll add is if you look at the macros in the U.S., we’re only developing about $1.35 million new units per year right now. And we need somewhere around $1.5 million to $1.6 million. So the next 12 to 18 months feel free safe as we look forward to the supply demand fundamentals generally.
Ivy Zelman: We're totally with you on that. Thanks for answering my questions. You guys have a good weekend.
Operator: And the question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Could we go back to the repair and maintenance issues, just curious if it had impact on your same-store revenue guide? Did you have a longer days the term of unit and maybe you could provide an update on how long it does take to turn a unit versus your expectations?
Charles Young: Repair and maintenance is really on occupied homes. So on our turns we haven't really seen any impact, and this time of year is a high turn volume. And we typically range in 10 to 12 days to turn a house, which is about where we are. It steps up a little bit because of the seasonality and the volume coming in this time a year, but we're on pace with where we were last year and been pretty consistent.
Fred Tuomi: And one metric we track is the days that we resident the downtime and between occupancy and vacancy. And quarter-over-over year ago were exactly the same number.
Wes Golladay: And when we do these initiatives in the back half, I think you said you're going to do a more methodical I mean those words you used. Are you going to do it by maybe one market at a time, or is it just going to be a more methodical process, in general?
Charles Young: Well, we're going to work through the exact rollout plan but it really depends on speed of how many homes you can put on the platform at once. But the idea for now is this couple of markets that we've piloted unified operating platform and then we roll by week being really thoughtful. When I say methodical, being really thoughtful around the time and month that we do it, so it's not during the early rent paying side. And then how much can our teams take on in terms of training, getting them ready, being thoughtful and then rolling it out. So we have a plan in place and we expect to start in the fourth quarter of this year. And based on all that we've done to-date in terms of our Web site, revenue management has been working on one platform, this is really the last piece and we think it will roll pretty smoothly.
Operator: At this time, this will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Greg Van Winkle: Okay, great. This is Greg Van again. Thank you all very much for your time today and your questions. We appreciate your interest as always and we look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming September conferences. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. We want to thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Invitation Homes First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Greg Van Winkle, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greg Van Winkle: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. On today's call from Invitation Homes are Fred Tuomi, Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer; and Dallas Tanner, Chief Investment Officer. I'd like to point everyone to our first quarter 2018 earnings press release and supplemental information, which we may reference on today's call. This document can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. I'd also like to inform you that certain statements made during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other nonhistorical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We described some of these risks and uncertainties in our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from the time to time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. During this call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these new measures with the most comparable GAAP measures, in our earnings release and supplemental information, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Fred Tuomi.
Frederick Tuomi: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We are eager to update you on our latest results, but first, I'd like to share a few high-level observations that I think are important to understand about Invitation Homes and our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders. First, we continue to believe the fundamentals of our business remained extremely strong. The dynamics of supply and demand remain very favorable and seem to be improving for the single-family rental business, especially across our unique, high-growth locations. In our markets, 2018 household formation is forecasted to grow at a rate 90% rate greater than the U.S. average. And single-family home completions are forecast to be almost 30% below the historical average since 1985. We believe this helps position us to achieve same-store NOI growth of 5% to 6% and core FFO growth near the top of the REIT sector for this year. Beyond this year, demographics in the United States should become increasingly impactful to our sector and should support strong single-family rental demand for years to come. The average age of the head of household in our homes is 39 years, meaning the millennial generation is just starting to reach the life stage where they needs align with our product. And although it is early, many believe it's possible that tax reform and rising interest rates will have a further positive impact on single-family rentals. In fact, turnover in the first quarter of 2018 declined to 7.6% from 8.1% in the first quarter of 2017, driven primarily by our year-over-year decrease and move-outs to home ownership from 25.7% to 22%. On the supply side, we believe that construction of new single-family homes is likely to remain muted for the foreseeable future due to the value of well-located land and the rising cost of materials and labor. We think this is especially true in our markets. The second point I want to make is that we believe our portfolio is one of the most desirable in residential real estate. Our locations are high growth, high quality and infill. It is a unique advantage to have 70% of revenue derived from the Western United States and Florida. We have carefully selected our submarkets and homes to be in high value locations with proximity to employment centers, good schools and transportation corridors, the 3 things residents tell us are most important to their families. And with over 4,800 homes on average per market, we have unmatched scale and density that is critical to our best-in-class operating efficiencies. Third, our business is built for all parts of the macroeconomic cycle. Single-family rental homes are well-positioned if interest rates continue to rise and the cost of homeownership increases. Relatively short-term leases allow us to quickly optimize revenue in the strong demand environment that typically coincides with rising interest rates. In addition, our homes are part of the most liquid real estate asset class in the world and represent value to both investors and traditional homeowners. Last but not least, our people are top-notch, from our Board of Directors to our corporate teams, to our associates in the field that interact and earn the loyalty of our residents. It is our people that enable us to deliver the exceptional quality of service that we commit to our residents every day. And it is our people that will drive us to higher levels of success as we continue to discover more ways to improve the experience of our residents and further optimize our operations. I thank all of our associates for making Invitation Homes a great place to call home. In short, families want to live in our desirable neighborhoods and homes. We think demand could increase and housing options could remain limited. We provide an opportunity which might not otherwise exist for families to thrive in a neighborhood of their choice. With that, I'll now provide a brief update on our start to 2018. We remain on track with our plan for the year. Our unique ProCare service delivery model continues to produce high resident satisfaction survey scores and first quarter revenue growth of 4.1% was in line with our expectation. One-time expenses contributed to higher overall expense growth in the first quarter, however, the outlook for the remainder of the remains positive. On merger integration, we remain on track with our plan to deliver the benefits we committed to our residents, associates and shareholders. Development of the systems and technology to support our new operating platform is on schedule. And we continue to expect the rollout of our unified field operating model to begin in the second half of 2018. Our investment management team remains on track with this capital recycling plan with approximately $50 million of acquisitions and $50 million of dispositions in the first quarter. We have also ramped up investment in select value enhancing CapEx opportunities to deliver residents more of the features they desire at the same time, we enhanced our risk-adjusted returns. On the balance sheet, we've continue progressing towards investment-grade with refinancings since SWAT transactions in the first half of 2018 to increase unencumbered assets, improve our maturity profile, lower future floating rate debt exposure and reduce our overall borrowing cost. In summary, we have accomplished a lot already in 2018, and we continue to be excited about the growth of this business in both the near and the long term. According to Case Shiller, home prices in our markets continue to appreciate almost 7% per year. When you consider the value of already embedded in our assets today, we believe there is no more compelling way to buy a scale and high quality portfolio, single-family rental homes than through the investments in Invitation Homes. So with that, our Chief Operating Officer, Charles Young, will now provide more detail on our operating results in the first quarter as well as the current trends.
Charles Young: Thank you, Fred. We continue to enjoy strong fundamentals with paveed the way for another solid quarter of growth in the first quarter of 2018. Our team is working well to keep field operations running smoothly at the same time that merger integration progresses according to plan. I'd like to thank our associates for their continued commitment to making 2018 a successful year with respect to both core operations and integration. It's been truly impressive to watch our teams in action, and I look forward to taking resident service to the next level when we empower them with an even more efficient, unified operating platform in the second half of 2018. I'll now spend some time walking you through the details of our first quarter 2018 operating performance. Same-store core revenues in the first quarter grew 4.1% year-over-year, in line with our expectations. The revenue increase was driven primarily by average rental rate growth of 4% and average occupancy remained strong at 95.7%. Same-store NOI grew 3.6%, a solid result considering one-time items that resulted in higher-than-normal same-store core and expense growth of 5.1% in the quarter. A key contributor to this expense increase was elevated repair and maintenance expense, which was atypical in nature attributable to a timing delay in completing routine non-storm-related service request in markets impacted by the September 2017 hurricane. Service across related to hurricane damage were prioritized in the fourth quarter of 2017 pushing noncritical routine service request that otherwise would have been resolved last year into the first quarter of 2018. Harsher winter weather in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 also contributed to higher repair and maintenance expenses. Next, I'll cover first quarter 2018 leasing trends. Same-store rent growth remained strong in the quarter with renewals again up almost 5%. Renewals represented 2/3 of the leases we executed in the first quarter. At the same time, turnover was even lower year-over-year at 7.6%, a testament to the value we believe residents continue to find in our first-class service on high quality homes and highly desirable locations. Same-store new lease growth was 2.5%, accelerating over the course of the first quarter as expected and blended rent growth was 4%. Western U.S. markets continue to lead the way for our growth as Northern and Southern California, Seattle and Phoenix were our strongest markets from a rent growth perspective in the first quarter. I'm also happy to report that we're seeing great momentum as we enter peak leasing season. Average occupancy increased to 96.1% in April 2018, up 20 basis points from April 2017, which puts us in an excellent position for growth. After increasing sequentially in each month of the first quarter, new lease rent growth accelerated to 4.5% in April 2018. Renewals also remained strong in April at 4.7%, resulting in a solid, blended rent growth of 4.6%. Main engine renewals have been quoted in the mid-5% range and we expect new lease growth to continue accelerating as we move further into peak season. Finally, a few words on how we're enhancing our resident experience. Our team members remain committed to providing every resident with the opportunity to live the leasing lifestyle they prefer and good neighborhoods close to their jobs and great schools, and we continue to innovate and enhance our property management operations to provide residents with the even more outstanding service. In the first quarter of 2018, we installed smart home technology in an additional 2,000 homes, bringing the total to almost 24,000. Smart home technology allows us to operate with greater efficiency and enables residents to enjoy their homes in a more convenient and energy-efficient fashion. We're also achieving high resident satisfaction scores as we continue rolling out our proprietary ProCare service model. As field integration takes the next tape later this year, we'll roll out more enhancements to our platform that will make the leasing lifestyle we provide to residents even better. I'm proud of what we have delivered so far and I look forward to working with all of our team members to continue enhancing the experience of our residents as we move forward. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Ernie Freedman.
Ernest Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today, we'll cover the following topics, portfolio activity for the first quarter, balance sheet and capital market activity; financial results for the first quarter and changes in our supplemental disclosures. I'll start with portfolio productivity. As we continue to recycle capital to further enhance the quality of our portfolio, in the first quarter 2018, total home count decreased by 61 to 82,509 homes or approximately 4,850 on average per market. We bought 190 homes for an estimated $53 million at an average cost basis of $277,000. And we sold 251 homes for $55 million at an average disposition price of $220,000. I'll now turn to an update on our balance sheet and capital markets activity. As previously communicated, we remain committed to working toward an investment-grade rating. Debt markets remain highly favorable for issuance, and we took advantage by refinancing approximately $2 billion of debt year-to-date to increase our unencumbered assets, improve our maturity profile and reduce borrowing costs, all on a leverage neutral basis. In February, we closed a 7-year securitization with the principal amount of $917 million at total cost of funds of LIBOR plus $124 million. We used net proceeds to repay in full all of our remaining 2019 secured debt maturities. In May, we closed another seven-year securitization with the principal amount of $1.1 billion a total cost of funds of LIBOR plus 1 38. We used net proceeds and cash on hand to repay $1.2 billion of secured debt maturing in 2020. Pro forma this latest refinancing, our weighted average was extended to 5.0 years, and we increased the number of homes in our unencumbered pool by 10% since the beginning of the year. Net interest expense is a combined results of the February and May transactions that's expected to decrease by $14 million on an annualized run rate basis. In addition to the refinancings, we entered into $2.5 billion of forward interest rate swap agreements subsequent to quarter end. After giving effect to these swaps and based on our current capital structure, the percentage of our debt that will be fixed or swapped to fixed rate beginning in January 2019 will increase to 87%. It is between 90% and 100% for the years 2020 through our debt's final maturities. We had over $1.1 billion of liquidity at quarter end through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facility. I'll now touch briefly on our first quarter 2018 financial results. Core FFO and AFFO per share for the first quarter increased 13.7% and 7.3% year-over-year, respectively, to $0.29 and $0.24. The primary driver of the increase was growth in NOI in addition to lower interest expense per share. Supplemental Schedule 1 provides a reconciliation from GAAP net loss to our reported FFO, core FFO and AFFO. As of today, we have earned an approximately $24 million of merger synergies on an annualized run rate basis, which includes $9 million of share-based compensation expense, mainly due to duplicate cost synergies. We continue to expect the majority of NOI related synergies to be realized later this year after the implementation of an enhanced operating platform for our field and corporate teams that combines the best of both legacy organizations. Therefore, we do not expect our achievement amount to increase materially during the next 90 days. The last thing I will cover is changes in our supplemental disclosures. As we noted in our last call, we updated our definition of same-store to consider homes that were required as part of our merger with Starwood Waypoint. Our supplemental reporting provides information concerning our same-store pool of 72,109 homes as of March 31, 2018. On Supplemental Schedule 6, we are providing additional detail on our total portfolio capital expenditures. You will notice two categories of capital expenditure that have been part of our business and subscription for the initial renovation CapEx that we invest in homes upon acquisition to bring them up to our standards and recurring CapEx of the to invest in our ongoing basis to maintain the quality of our homes. We are also providing detail on the third bucket, value enhancing CapEx, which we've more recently introduced. Value enhancing CapEx is investment we make in stabilized homes to enhance risk-adjusted returns. For example, we might see an opportunity to upgraded kitchen to a higher and fit and finish or expand an upward living area in an allocation data tells us residents will pay a premium for these types of amenities. Recurring CapEx is the only portion of our CapEx that we deduct from core FFO to arrive at AFFO. It is the component of CapEx included in total cost to maintain. I'll close by reiterating what Fred mentioned in his opening remarks, that we've accomplished much already in 2018, thanks to our top-notch team of associates and the energy they bring every day, and we are excited for the future. Fundamentals remained strong and our best-in-class portfolio and resident service continue to be an advantage, making us confident and excited as our teams move forward in 2018, seeking to further elevate the value of Invitation Homes to both shareholders and residents. With that, operator, would you please open up the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America.
Juan Sanabria: Ernie, I was just hoping on the cost side for the same-store expenses that would be higher than you expected. Can you help us quantify that? And was that more in the sway portfolio just given their taxes exposure?
Ernest Freedman: Sure, China, I'm happy to provide some clarification and actually, we weren't surprised by the 5.1% expense growth year-over-year. The net impact of the one-time items we disclosed in the supplemental was about $700,000. And actually, more that came from the IH aside from the Fort exposure with regards to the hurricane. So without of those expense growth would have been 4.5%. The other driver for the expense growth was real estate taxes. And we disclosed in Supplemental Schedule. Real estate Texas are up 7.3% year-over-year, which is a pretty high number, and Prop 13 in California wasn't the culprit behind it. The good news of Prop 13, as you know that going forward, will state tax increases are statutorily is 32%, which is great for almost 13,000 homes that we own in California. But both our IPO in February 2017 and the merger with Starwood Waypoint late in the year were triggering events for valuation reassessments. And Q1 was a specially difficult comp for this California taxes and if you could not book our Prop 13 tax adjustment in Invitation Homes until the second quarter last year as we disclosed in last year's second quarter earnings release. So in Q1 '18, we had higher California taxes from both the IPO early in the year as well as from Starwood Waypoint merger later in the year. Without that noise from Prop 13, real estate tax growth would have been 4.5% year-over-year for the quarter, Juan, it's better than the 5% expectation for the year for taxes prior to the impact of Prop 13. So actually, we had a good result in real estate taxes before Prop 13. Without Prop 13, our overall expense growth would have been about 150 basis points more favorable. So expense growth would have been about 3% for the quarter year-over-year versus the 51 that we reported you want to take it impacts from the one-time items as well as Prop 13.
Juan Sanabria: That's very helpful. And then just switching gears to the balance sheet, another one for you, Ernie. Leverage ticked up to a bit quarter-over-quarter. What drove that? And how do you think about the tools to reduce leverage outside of retained cash flow and given your view of cost of capital today, what are the alternatives or how you're thinking about that?
Ernest Freedman: Yes, sure. So you did see that our net debt-to-EBITDA went from 9.5x in the last quarter - 9.7, modest change. That really just come down to where adjusted EBITDA was for the two periods, ad there was refinancing transaction in the first quarter when we actually proceeds also that cover the financing costs. And so, fully expect by the end of the year, as we've talked about, we'll reduce that as numbers by about one turns. So we'll definitely be in the high 8 so about 9x and expect that to happen. And in terms of tools that are available to us, John, certainly the most important one is what you point out was the retain cash flow and our NOI still projected to be 5% to 6%, adjusted EBITDA growth, [indiscernible] start to grow very strongly and with our dividend payout ratio, where it is, using that retained cash. And then we periodically, you're here on a monthly basis, we look out with opportunities are for Dallas on the capital recycling front and decide what makes them regards to capital recycling how to use those proceeds. And today, we've had some modest purchases here in the first quarter. We talked about in the prepared remarks. And so we do give consideration whether we want to pivot from there or not. But we're very pleased with our plan and continue to stay on track with regards to acquisitions and dispositions about being equally weighted in 2018. And then what's keep all our opportunities available to us broadly to raise capital and if it made sense, the considerably consider that as well to help improve the leverage profile.
Operator: The next question comes from Drew Berdin with Baird.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Alex on for Drew this morning. I was wondering if you could look a little bit what you guys are convinced expectations were going into the strong peak season. It looks like national, a little short wondering if any markets kind of gamble are you would you guys expect to internal and where you guys so a lot of great occupancy strengths?
Charles Young: Yes, this is Charles, thanks for the question. We actually did exactly what we wanted to do in Q1. In the last call, we mentioned that we were up a little behind on where we wanted to be at the end of the quarter, want to build and occupancy through Q1. And we did exactly that. And we added about 40 basis points moving us up to 95 7. And we continue to add actually in April so we're up north of 96% where the average in April, which is great news overall. It puts us in a really good position for peak leasing season. Through that 90% plus percent of our markets all added occupancy in Q1. So we did is actually what we hoped. And because that, again, blended rent growth came in stronger but renewals carry that they, and we were just shy of 5%. In Q1, we're seeing solid, continued renewal growth. They obviously are 2/3 of all the new leases that we do. But ultimately, we're seeing the growth come in new leases, and we ended April at 4.5%. So we're position very well going into peak leasing season.
Unidentified Analyst: Perfect, that's really helpful. And kind of switching over. You guys alluded to on a continued growth in the smart home technology. program. Wondering how you guys think about internal the ROI you guys get from that? Are there cost savings? Can you charge higher premiums on the rents? And kind of just wondering what you see the future of that program looks like?
Charles Young: Yes, overall, our program is really been great for us. It's not only the ability that we can actually charge additional fees. There's ancillary revenue that we're able to charge and gain some revenue. But ultimately, it's as much about the operational efficiencies that we get from being able to do as self-show, letting our vendors and in knowing when they're in. It's in the utility management when we're owning the homes and they're not least to be able to reduce those costs on an ongoing basis. And our residents really enjoy the convenience of the self-show and the ability to have the efficiencies for them and their families to be able to let people are on their home and to control their utilities while they're living at least in lifestyle in our homes.
Frederick Tuomi: Yes, this is Fred. In the original idea of the thesis for the smart home was to take care of some operational challenges that we have in single-family rental, namely key control, access to the home by vendors, by our field employees, et cetera. And then, it also to maintain control over the utility costs during the renovation and eventual return process. Then, that the idea of allowing our prospects to interact with the system so they could choose if they wanted to have our shelf showing experience. And we found in the DVD was a very, very large proportion of people really chose preferred the shelf showing options. So about 570 to almost to 80% of our prospects are choosing that. If they want to have a guided tour the leasing professional they can certainly do that as well. And then with the just, just the ads for the smart from that sweeping the nation, was of us know either have them or are considering adding smart home capabilities to our homes. So there's actually demand for that. We realized that they can actually facilitate in that need and that desire. So we make it optional for our residents if they so choose, they're going to have to control to the same system of that front door of that thermostat and then we have other ideas that things that we can add to it in the future. Then if they do, there's a cost of that we believe is a rental cost at lower, lower cost all in and much more convenient of implementation try to assemble these parts and gadget themselves.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, that's very helpful. And is that 2000 quarter kind of what you guys are targeting now going forward or is it kind of opportunistic where you guys see for?
Charles Young: At that's typical where we're trying to go. We're installing the new technology on the hill renewals. So as the house returns, we'll put it in and then it becomes part of the pool to help us with leasing and ultimately, we'd be able to upsell to our residents if they choose to do it. What's great is nearly 80% of our new leases that are - payout of the smartphone opportunity are taken advantage of it. It's been great for us.
Operator: The next question comes from Douglas Harter with Credit Suisse.
Douglas Harter: I was just hoping we can talk about CapEx a little bit and your expectations there both on the R&M side and the revenue enhancing side.
Ernest Freedman: Sure. So what specifically is your question, Doug?
Douglas Harter: Just, I guess, the outlook for 2018. Look like the year-over-year growth in CapEx in 1Q was fairly high. Just wondering if that was just a tougher comparison or if that's the level we should be expecting.
Ernest Freedman: Sure. This is Ernie. I'll handle the question around the current CapEx [indiscernible] talk about the value enhancing CapEx. On the recurring CapEx, we think is a real opportunity for us where the two formal organizations really different spend levels with regards to CapEx and our expectation be kind to get to a blended number of working toward a better number over time. And so we did achieved what was closer to the blended number of about $1,200, $1,300 per door here in our first quarter so I think and we talked about in the last quarter, the, I think for the time, $1,200 to $1,400 is probably a good number for us there was the opportunity to do better on that we can been better and that in the past. In addition, the number is a little bit higher in the first quarter because of the - what we talked about earlier about the work orders from the hurricane carrying over into the first quarter in terms of the routine type stuff. So a little bit more difficult comp because of that, but also we're taking the best of both organizations and moving forward and going to get to best practices. So I think that's where I'm not on recurring CapEx. You want to quickly talk about value enhancing CapEx and what we're thinking about that?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, sure. As we look for ways to optimize the customer expense going forward, one of the things that be found to be very effective as we roll out and pilot, we've talked a little bit about last year is in this revenue enhancing CapEx idea, where we allow the customers help make decisions on the home, but not only hardened the asset but they're willing to pay for it. So will give you an example. With it, last month Orlando, 30 plus types of these projects were on average rate spending call it $5,000, $6,000 per home and the incremental call it bump on rents that our customers are willing to pay, that's an opt in negotiation on their part, would put us somewhere between a 15% and 20%, call it, ROI on those dollars on an unlevered basis. And so examples of this, as Ernie mentioned in the call, upgrading kitchens, hardwood flooring, other ways that we can actually had in the asset to call the customer choice, which is a win-win for our obviously the customer will get a stickier customer that wants to be with us longer because of the feel like they have the ability optimize a part their home and for us it's all better because the customer that's willing to stay and participate in that leasing, as Charles laid out early.
Operator: The next question comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill: First question just has to do with the work orders that were kicked out from the hurricane in those markets. I know you guys do a lot of surveys of the residence after the reporters are done. Has there been any impact to the happiness of the resident on the work order having to wait to get some of the stuff done?
Frederick Tuomi: Yes, the priority that we had on those work orders were obviously to make sure that we were dealing with anything that was an emergency or habitability issues. And we felt like those priorities were the right approach. Some of the ones that regulate for more routine work orders around fencing, maybe some landscaping, there was a little delay there, obviously. And we do track after every interaction with the residents. And the scores came down slightly, but not materially. And we built them back real quickly as soon as we were able to service of those homes. So part of what you're seeing is not only the timing, but also the building timing of where they're coming through and they had in Q1. So overall, maybe a slight blip but no real material change in our teams really focus on trying to work through these as quickly as we could, really proud of what they've been able to do given the size and scale of the amount that came through Florida.
Dennis McGill: And given what you learned in hindsight, would you change the way you structure sort of the repair and maintenance efforts in the event of a significant weather event again?
Frederick Tuomi: Well, part of where the opportunity that we have with combining the best of both worlds is we've already started on that path using the technology platform for the maintenance will allow us to work through the work orders quicker. And we think that will be a real answer going forward. So this is just one example of many where we're able to look across the organization and we keep what we think is best and the technology platform allows us to get more vendors into the platform, use our in-house vendors as well as a bull and move through the quarters in a more timely fashion. So we're really proud of what we've been able to do there and we're implementing that, as we speak is paid great.
Dennis McGill: Separate question probably for Dallas on Brazil an offer Program. I remember you participate in that trial and expanding that and looking to take that more market. And you maybe talk about that as the channel for you dollars if you're looking to participate with them are similar opportunities elsewhere in the market?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, absolutely. We look at the silence and offer program as one of many, quite frankly, where we're starting to see the rate customers transact change. And it's like Uber for being in a car versus a taxi. We're starting people make decision or maybe do want to go outside of ordinary call it, broker channels, to buy and sell homes. Rated pilot and created in the instant app program with Zillow night last year and that has now evolved into a much more robust program like you're seeing with Opendoor and some of it with our companies. We look at this as one of many chalices that will provide opportunities for comments like Invitation Homes to be able to acquire and assets and more importantly, customers. We also think there will be added benefit perhaps, to some other programs, like sale-leaseback, where somebody can ultimately sell their home to a company like Invitation and then have an option there, lease back from us from year to when they make their next life decision. So you're spot on it, Dennis in terms of where are you going to see to continue this market and being the largest owner of the single-family we need to have a front seat as we watch that part of the market develop and more importantly participate in it.
Dennis McGill: And in those markets were in the trial Phoenix Las Vegas and this maybe more Phoenix free. Are you seeing every offer that comes through? Are you part of that program?
Dallas Tanner: You're definitely part of the programs in public, and we have been. And we've worked with that, not only Zillow, but other companies to find ways to help optimize that lead funnel. And so will continue to do so and expect us to be active in that space.
Operator: Next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao: Just wanted to go back to the integration part of the conversation it sounds like the merger integration plans are on track. And you guys have alluded to a couple of times some pickup in the back half of the year is integrate the platforms, but together best practices I was just curious if you could share the learning so far. What maybe some insights or preview of what might be coming in the second half?
Frederick Tuomi: Yes, Vincent. This is Fred. The integration, as we said in our prepared remarks, is working according to plan. And we're really pleased with the performance of our team, everyone working on this integration. Most of the enabling work is coming to the completion phase, that was the first phase of the project, obviously. And we're geared up now and ready to start the implementation in the field throughout the field platform that will impact more of the customer life cycle, the attraction, acquisition onboarding, the ongoing service to our field organization. So the synergies that we've been discussing since the very announcement of the $45 million to $50 million on a run rate basis by in early of 2019, are those cost synergies that the specific identify cost synergies related to this implementation of this combined platform both corporate and field. So there are other potential synergies that we've alluded to. Sometime still on the cost side. We're seeing more opportunity on procurement. And when you cut another benefit of this merger has our market level, scale and density, which makes it, not only our sales more efficient, but our vendors more efficient as well. So we expect to share those vendor opportunities as we get a little more - we have to have some meetings with more vendors and suppliers in terms of procurement strategies. So we expect that will be an additional pick up. And then we also feel like the current plan is excellent and we're implementing that plan, but there's always way to optimize it further once we establish it, get to the field and get up and running. So those are some opportunities on the procurement side. Then the revenue, we really see there is - I mean, we can add more value enhancing services to our residents of than we have some plans for that, which is again with a density, where the scale. And we have more opportunities to provide additional goods and services to our residents that will add to the value of their expenses. There will be a revenue opportunity for us going forward.
Vincent Chao: And then, I guess, another question on the same-store expense side. Ernie, you've outlined sort of maybe a core same-store expense growth of 3% ex one-time items and some of the tax implications. I'm just curious if you look at the guidance for the rest of the year, does imply something below that 3% level for the balance of the year. And it does seem like if you take the average of the sway portfolio plus the Invitation portfolio, that the comparisons do a little tougher in the second and third quarters and I was just curious if there's anything else that we should be aware of that, that might be helping and keep those cost down.
Ernest Freedman: Yes, sure. So for instance, with Prop 13, I alluded to the fact that we have a difficult comp in the first quarter because we didn't book Prop 13 in Invitation Homes last year the first quarter. We doubled up in the second quarter last year. So Prop 13 should be more manageable for us in the second quarter, make real estate taxes a little bit easier because that's one example. And another example is we do expect to get some NOI synergies in the second half of the year mainly as we get into the fourth quarter. And we haven't been specific about what those would be other than speaking generally and we're speaking more specifically to those we get into the second quarter on our earnings alliance call. That's all bit of talent that we expect to have some modest help from as well. So days made there is a little bit easier for that but ship risk and opportunities with any guidance and numbers and I'd say the opportunity areas for us are continue pushing other things that Fred just talked about with regard to the synergy as well as we're getting smarter and how we're in the business as we learn how to use the previously run their businesses and take the best of both and I said there is adding for us is on property taxes. Notwithstanding what I talked about on our property taxes early, we're very early in the year and most real estate tax assessments, and the second half of the year and often in the second half of the second half of the year. And at this point, we've only received and full of notices back from California with regards to some of the various things - the reassessments of events we've had. So there's opportunity for us to be better-than-expected I will say? Taxes but of course, there's an opportunity for us to be in the right direction for us to do. So we still have a wide range of 2% to 3%. We see a path for us to in that range until good about it, and we'll certainly no better in 90 days.
Operator: The next question comes from Jade Rahmani with KBW.
Jade Rahmani: Can you elaborate on the initiatives to introduce other revenues, products that you could charge tenants for that enhance their lifestyle but with produced revenues for Invitation Homes? And mean can you give some examples?
Frederick Tuomi: Yes, one example is adding on to our smart home capability. We have hubs ups in place in which gives you a lot of optionality in the future. The basis system that we offer now is simply the lock and the thermostat, which is very important. Those are the primary features of a smart home. But there are other features as well. People could use if they wanted to have video monitoring either exterior or interior space. People could choose to have implement home security systems, either just the intrusion alarm or a full monitored system. We could get into a landscaping with the density of our portfolio, the ability to offer landscaping at a very cost-effective basis becomes more and more probable. So that's a couple of other things. And then analysis in terms of the rev X, offering customized interiors, offer our customer base upgrades, we want to make their lifestyle so easy so that people can step into a lifestyle that meets their needs, meets their desires, have some optionalities, they have influence in designing their own expense all for a leasing payment profile versus coming out of pocket. There's other products and services we're talking a lot of other large-scale vendors in terms of doing some joint marketing campaigns, which provide again our value-added, efficient this durable good services and products to our residents.
Jade Rahmani: Just wanted to ask separately about the Denver core NOI margin, which improved on a same-store basis pretty robustly. Could you give any color on the improvements and also, structurally, is the main difference and reason for the high-margin in that market property taxes primarily? Or is there some other attributes?
Ernest Freedman: Yes so Jade Denver always perform pretty high for us in fact, it's mid- to high 70s where outed NOI margin in the first quarter are around while it state tax growth so we were over accrued will say taxes based on where some sense came in earlier this year and then also allow us to set their assessment for next 2018 to a lower level as well as the real estate taxes that's one of the reasons were in our outperformance real estate taxes notwithstanding what I talked about earlier. In general, then we'll perform very well similar to phoenix as well as Las Vegas. Cost to maintain tend to be a bit lower a real estate taxes are reasonable. In fact, those in the sort of likely continue to be one of our areas highest margin markets in the portfolio.
Operator: The next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.
John Pawlowski: Fred, I'll ask you to put your department operations have back on for a minute. Over the long run, we'll investors have to live with much greater volatility in the R&M wide this asset class versus a province given the nature of the footprint?
Frederick Tuomi: Absolutely not. I think you've seen us over the last couple of years, we develop this business. It's a place of the business and optimizes business. The numbers have been very consistent. And there are, I would say that they're consistent with the numbers that we've been telling and forecasting for the last couple of years. We've always said that, that total cost of maintaining would be between $2,600, $2,800 per home per year and that's exactly where we continue to see it over the long run because that we rebuild to that estimate was based on mathematics. Looking at the useful life, remaining useful life, typically useful life and cost, all the components of a single-family home. So I don't think you're going to see volatility going forward. We have one-time events this quarter. From time to time, you may have one-time events in any product type, residential or non-residential, apartment or single-family. So that's what we're dealing with here as we explained.
John Pawlowski: Dos your long-term cost to maintain estimate include some type of average severe weather reserve concept?
Frederick Tuomi: It's based on just the each component of the home, whether it's HVAC, roof, foundations, exterior, interior, the cost for those and then the typical useful life.
John Pawlowski: Okay. I mean, we keep using the term one-time in nature. The skeptical analyst in me says we're going to keep having one-time cost spikes because weather can be unpredictable given in the nature of this footprint, the disparate nature of the homes. So I guess, how much confidence do you have with this type of events are really one-time in nature.
Frederick Tuomi: Well, for example, this quarter, okay, we saw the work spike starting very early in January. And then, obviously, looked into this quickly and saw that the cost was just - the pushing of the routine work orders from that Q4 prioritize for the hurricane into January below the number came down in February, continue to come down in March. And by the way, March was back to normal, normal levels. So and they're happy to report in April, same thing, back to normal expected levels or a slightly better. So that was our characterization. That was a one-time event based on that event, which was two hurricanes, two major areas impacting lots of different businesses, including ours. Now could we say that hurricanes will never happen again? No. But do they happen every year? Of course, not. So it's going to be these more in frequent one-time hard to predict, hard to forecast, hard to budget, hard to guide into those types of activities. We would not build a business plan based on anticipation of a major hurricane going to the state of Florida.
John Pawlowski: Okay make sense. And then last one for me, dollars, I know Chicago home price appreciation has been lackluster at best. Within your Chicago portfolio, are you actually seeing absolute decline at the home prices in any pockets of your portfolio?
Dallas Tanner: No. Well, maybe I wouldn't say in any pockets. We're seeing kind of slow steady growth out of Chicago. Fortunately, I think from an operational standpoint, we've gotten much better than from an occupancy standpoint we starting to see a little more renewal growth and leasing. From both cold legacy portfolio but we will continue to do there is optimize and part of the portfolio in position where it can be the most successful. We've talked about this in the past, but Midwest concentration versus less than 6.5% of our menu so it's not a key focus. Our story release West Coast and Southeast. If you look at the end of that type of growth, John, I think that's a little bit of a no-brainer but we don't disagree. We like to see more growth out of Chicago we like to see better efficiencies just having to see a lot of it in terms of HBI, but we're seeing a little bit of it.
Frederick Tuomi: I'll just add, Chicago operationally, we've really seen a nice movement. We ended the quarter at 95% or slightly above. And into April, we're north of 96%. And with that, when you look at blended rank growth year-over-year, it's actually starting to accelerate where we moved up into the positive 2s and then expanding into April to North of 2. So we're - operationally feel good about it, and with our scale and combined portfolio, we feel like we're in good shape to continue to push forward.
John Pawlowski: Right. And Case Shiller has a Chicago market January and February of about 2.7% home price appreciation.
Operator: The next question comes from Ryan Gilbert with BTIG.
Ryan Gilbert: I was wondering if you can describe any of the best practices you've taken away from your hurricane response over the past three quarters that you can apply the next time the portfolio expenses if you're rather event?
Frederick Tuomi: Yes, thank you. This is Charles. On the sway side, having gone through to last year, both Harvey, which hit Houston and Irma that came to Florida and on the IH site, both of us going through the Florida storms. We learned a lot in terms of preparation, getting out ahead, working with the vendors. Harvey, specifically was more really water, not as much wind. So we were able to have anticipation with our vendors to have fans and dehumidifiers and extra vendors ready to be kind of first responders to some instances we're on the ground before. Many of the other first responders and one of the best practices we did between both sides was to be thoughtful around the displacement of our residents. We stopped leasing our homes and allowed that residents to be - have first choice of moving to any of our homes. So we learn from that. Are there other things we can do? I think what we talked about from an operational side is just comparing those notes. I also mentioned earlier and the call that our technology platform was a big help on the sway side as we implemented that on the cross portfolio. I think will be in better position to respond faster than we did in this instance. So a lot to learn. And we'll continue to compare notes if we, God forbid, something would happen again.
Ryan Gilbert: And then on renewal rents, it looks like over the past five quarters, you're western markets has been averaging mid to high 6s, the rest of the portfolio closer to four, mid 4s us. Wondering if you're seeing an opportunity to bring the year annual growth rate in the rest of your portfolio closer to where your Western markets are trading or that's just a function of the high HPA, low supply until locations of your Western portfolio?
Charles Young: Yes, you kind of answered the question for us. That resin exposure allows us to kind of optimize some of the renewal growth out there. But if you look across the portfolios, historically, we've been really at that kind of high 4s consistently on renewals. Regardless of seasonality, that's where renewals are consistent. There's ultimately 2/3 of our releases. So you're going to get, based on supply-demand in some of the HPA growth, that Western markets are going to push, but you'll still see good renewal growth out of some of our other markets. And when you take a blended portfolio like this, we think that high 4s and low 5s is where we're going to settle.
Operator: The next question comes from Donald Camden with Morgan Stanley.
Donald Camden: Just going back to the opening comments about the average age and the impact of the lower generation. Just cares, so that - is that consistent across both the legacies Starwood homes as well as Invitation Homes? And is there any noticeable trend about that generation and that you could point to?
Frederick Tuomi: Yes interesting question. We've talked a lot about that on a large-scale basis, just look at the demographics of this country. Demographics are undeniable. Doesn't really what house is for the economy, people still get older every year. So when you look at the millennial cohort, which is actually larger, and the baby boom cohort, it's going to have a massive impact of the nation's economy for the next 10 years or more. So the impact to our business is there coming to age, not the leading edge of this million dollars year quarter. It's getting to the age and the life stage for the behaviors are going to begin to change. And so fleet living by themselves living with roommates in the urban setting. Some of them or many of them over the next decade are going to be moving into the part thereof, rather going to have relationship start from a more traditional family decisions and their needs and desires in open court or more of schools, with a safety, with the excess or transportation, et cetera. So we think that, that demand is going to be bode well for single family of, both purchase and rental. Then with the millennials, a lot of the research says or speculations us continue to want to stream their lifestyle a loss of years, the asset light and experience focus. And with that, comes to the desire to please the lifestyle they can live. actually opportunity so that better lifestyle through leasing their home versus purchasing. So a lot of demographic and psychographic reasons why we think this is going to be are very bullish lien for us in terms for the next decade or more steady demand from this cohort.
Donald Camden: Great. And then the other question I had, just circling back to the revenue enhancing CapEx discussion. I'm just trying to understand what the opportunity is there. Is that something that obviously you're doing as homes are rolling. But is that - could that be 20,000 homes, 40,000 homes? Just trying to get a sense of the opportunity there.
Dallas Tanner: Yes, I'll take that. This is Dallas. It's still early days in terms of how much absorption we can have call it in a given year. We've laid out that we think we can be across kind of them married of call it revenue generating opportunities and kind of CapEx spend between $15 million and $20 million a year in this type of program right now over time will tell I mean, Fred laid out in talked about some of the purse that are available. We also believe that this living lesson doesn't only hold itself to win their interim they could be moving in, bring out. There's a lot of different reasons that we can optimize growth for this business. So I would say that it's still too early to say what that capture rate will be while their home. But we're certainly are bullish about what the opportunity that's in front of us.
Operator: The next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.
Wesley Golladay: Looking at the supply outlook, are there any markets that stand out maybe for the next two years, where you see competitive supply pressure and competitive defined as will pressure your submarket and your price point?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, I mean, again, this is Dallas. Without a doubt, the markets are type Fred just talked about this a second ago we're going to have 12.5 million in your household forms over the next decade, and we're not building supply today to just keep up with a normal household formation so as you start to think through that you know that's going to put an imbalance of pressure on call it new home pricing or current pricing in this higher barrier-to-entry markets or without a date, we would anticipate that we lived in a normal market per the last couple of recent we've had only between two and three months of home supply in any of the 17 markets that we're in today across Invitation Homes. We see that changing in the foreseeable future. We see that come if anything, that may tighten a bit and with some of the choices and decisions being delayed like getting married, some of these other things that we're talked about, it puts us in a unique advantage to have probably the right type of demand function on our product specifically. So we are not building a forecast for the next three years, where we're going to see a lot of supply. Actually, quite the contrary. We're trying to make sure that we optimize the way that we can for those external growth opportunities, living in our supply environments going forward.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. And you mentioned an entity such as Zillow on Opendoor changing the way home so that are bought. I wondered if there is some point had an opportunity for joining homes to have a third-party management use your scale. Imagine that they have a big risk would be hold an inventory, and that's where you could probably help them out.
Frederick Tuomi: Yes, that's an interesting concept. We've been asked to consider that. But we have no interest at this time of pursuing that strategy. We've got a big integration in front of us. We have a lot of things to accomplish of our own portfolio, for our owned assets of our shareholders. You never say never. But it certainly not in our near-term playbook. But the platform that we have developed and continue to develop to further innovations and additions I think have a lot of intrinsic value. Maybe someday in the future, we look at ways on how to leverage that differently.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.
Anthony Paolone: I guess, for Dallas, can. You walk through some of your major markets and talk about where yields are on acquisitions for a product in your bio box?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Sure, no problem. Well, I mean, you know that we have scale in California and Seattle. Let's start in the West Coast specifically. I mean, those are markets, where I'll give you an example like in California you could be buying between call it an NOI cap rate, somewhere between 4.5 and a 5, depending on the market or submarket at that you're specifically trying to invest in. As we can be instilled solid suburbs in markets in the Southeast really can buy between the 5.5 and 6 capital depending on type of home and type of neighborhood. So it varies a large degree and it varies by the amount of call it available supply that you can actually by but generally speaking, I mean, we're very bullish postmerger and expanding our footprint in markets like Denver and Dallas. And we'll find ways to continue to grow the portfolio were all the fundamentals are saying, we want to be because it's more people want to be. It's rarely job growth and household formation will continue to occur.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. And then just second question for Ernie. scheduled 2b, if I look at your weighted average interest rate of 3.5%, can you roll that forward like you did with kind of the description of fixed versus putting debt when you kind of move through all the swaps and look ahead?
Ernest Freedman: Oh, I can't do that off the top of my head, Tony so let me get back on you that. But certainly, we have a couple things that are going to go against each other as we go forward by the current debt that we have in place, it's cost will likely go up a little bit because of our futures reps are a little bit more expensive than in the market Kirkland's roll off. Offsetting that is we have spreads today embedded in a lot of these instruments that are not market spreads today. Experts have come down quite a bit since the original financing were down two, three, four years ago so you're going to have international offsets. But I can talk to you off-line and how - point to you what you can see in our discussion we can have a sense of how that will change based on the current debt profile of the controversy, but we're still very optimistic that we have chance to offset those who increase in cost and tighter spread as we continue to about refinancing activity for the rest of this year.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Fred Tuomi for any closing remarks.
Frederick Tuomi: All right. Thank you, everybody. Thank you again for joining us today. We appreciate your interest, as always, in Invitation Homes. And we look forward to many of the with the upcoming NAREIT in June in Europe.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Invitation Homes Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greg Van Winkle, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greg Van Winkle: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call. On today's call from Invitation Homes are Fred Tuomi, Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; Charles Young, Chief Operating Officer; and Dallas Tanner, Chief Investment Officer. I'd like to point everyone to our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings press release and supplemental information, which we may reference on today's call. This document can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. As previously announced, Invitation Homes completed its merger with Starwood Waypoint Homes on November 16, 2017. Information presented for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 includes the impact of the merger. Additionally, in order to provide consistent comparisons with results reported in the first three quarters of 2017, we present same-store results independently for each of the Invitation Homes same-store portfolio and the legacy Starwood Waypoint same-store portfolio. In each case, metrics have been defined consistently with historical methodologies for each of the two companies. Beginning in 2018, in order to provide the most relevant information about our operations as a combined company, we have consolidated the two same store portfolios into one. Finally, I'd like to inform you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risk and uncertainties in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our merger proxy filed on October 16, 2017 and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. During this call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and supplemental information, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Fred Tuomi.
Frederick Tuomi: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to report today for the first time as one combined company the new Invitation Homes. I'm pleased to report we closed out 2017, a transformational year, with even stronger results than expected, and our merger integration is off to a great start. What a year it has been for Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint. Our teams produced great operating results, with same-store NOI increasing approximately 7% in 2017 for the pro forma combined company and our core NOI margin expanding to approximately 65%. Same-store revenue growth remained strong at almost 5% in 2017 while turnover was steady at approximately 35%, a testament to the value we believe residents continue to find in our first-class service in high quality homes and highly desirable locations. Home prices in our markets appreciated over 6% in 2017, further enhancing the embedded value of our real estate. In addition to same-store NOI growth consistently among the best in the entire REIT sector, Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint's accomplishments in 2017 include the following: the acquisition of over 5,700 homes and sale of almost 2,800 homes, further improving our already high-quality and well-positioned portfolio of homes; the continued revitalization of communities and support of local vendors through the renovation of over 3,500 homes and over $200 million of home maintenance on behalf of our residents; over $8.5 billion of capital raised, including the second largest REIT IPO to date and the industry's first agency financing with Fannie Mae, allowing us to push out maturities, reduce our borrowing cost and grow our unencumbered asset pool; and a transformational merger, creating the preeminent leader in the single-family rental space with $21 billion of enterprise value at over 80,000 homes. I'd like to thank all of our associates across the country for these many accomplishments and their continued dedication to earning the loyalty of our residents. Looking ahead, we expect another year of strong results in 2018. Supply and demand fundamentals remain favorable in our markets, led by approximately 70% exposure to the Western United States and the State of Florida. Leading real estate economists expect job growth in Invitation Homes markets to be over 50% higher than the national average in 2018, resulting in expected household formation growth of 1.9% compared to the national average of 1%. The fact is there's a shortage of housing to absorb this demand with housing permits in our markets less than 1% of existing stock. Furthermore, the leading edge of the millennial generation is just beginning to reach the age where the needs of their lifestyle and their life stage align with single-family homes in high-quality neighborhoods. We expect consumer preference, economics and the value provided through our high quality products and service to lead many of these new single-family home consumers to Invitation Homes. The bottom line is it's a very good time to be invested in single-family homes for rent. In addition to these strong macro tailwinds, we're excited to begin realizing the benefits of our merger for both investors and our residents. In line with our initial estimate, we have identified $45 million to $50 million of annualized run rate cost synergies and believe there could be additional upside as we implement best practices across the organization. After closing the merger last November, our teams immediately got to work executing an integration plan designed to deliver these synergies, and we are on track with this plan. Current and prospective residents experienced a seamless transition and are already enjoy benefits, including a new and improved resident website and the rollout of further enhancements to our unique ProCare service model. At our corporate and field offices, the go-forward leadership teams have been identified and are in place, and all key decisions on strategy and operating methodologies have been made. A plan is in place for a unified platform and operating strategy to be rolled out across our markets over the next few quarters. This strategy combines each company's strengths into one highly efficient, customer-centric operating platform, leveraging our deep talent and advanced technologies, including the ProCare service model, Smart Home technology and our proprietary [Atlas] property management system. As we execute our plan, we believe our combined resources will allow us to enable us to provide even higher-quality service and greater choice to our residents, making an even larger contribution to economic growth, job creation and the vitality of our local communities which we serve. In light of a strong fundamental backdrop, in 2018, we expect same-store core revenue growth between 4% and 5% and same-store NOI growth between 5% and 6%. Our operational priorities for 2018 are all about execution. First, continue to deliver strong operating results across our core portfolio. Second, execute operationally to further enhance the quality of service we provide to our residents. Third, execute on our integration plan to realize the value we indicated for residents, team members and shareholders. Fourth, recycle capital to continue increasing the quality of our portfolio. And fifth, continue to make meaningful progress on the path to an investment-grade balance sheet. Finally, we believe in the exceptional value of our assets today and well into the future. Single-family rental homes enjoy low resident turnover and provide stable and predictable cash flows. They represent the most liquid real estate asset class in the world and provide value to both investors as well as traditional homeowners. We believe our rent growth and home price appreciation could outperform other real estate classes for years to come due to the strong supply-demand fundamentals and long-term demographic trends. Within this uniquely compelling asset class, we have purchased and renovated homes in highly desirable infill neighborhoods of high-growth markets and built an industry-leading operating platform with unmatched scale and market density. Based on guidance provided to date by companies across the real estate universe, our projected 2018 NOI growth is more than twice the current REIT average. And that is before the full impact of expected NOI synergies from our merger. Margins continue to improve as we get better at our business. Core FFO growth is projected to be double digits for Invitation Homes and more than three times the current REIT average. We are more excited than ever about our ability to create value for our residents, our team members and our shareholders. And I thank each of our stakeholders for entrusting us to do just that. All of this makes us very proud of what we have accomplished so far, confident in our ability to deliver consistent, exceptional results and optimistic for the future success and value of Invitation Homes. So with that, our Chief Operating Officer, Charles Young, will now provide more detail on our strong operating results in the fourth quarter, full-year and the start to 2018. Charles?
Charles Young: Thank you, Fred. The fourth quarter of 2017 was another good quarter for us operationally, setting us up for continued strong growth in 2018. As the merger integration progresses on schedule, our field operations continue to run smoothly. Our teams are working well together, and we closed the year with strong results. That momentum has carried into the early stages of 2018. As Fred mentioned, fundamentals in our markets remained favorable, and our associates in the field are excited to leverage an even more scaled and efficient operating platform to deliver outstanding service to our loyal residents. I'll now walk you through details of our operating performance starting with the Invitation Homes same-store portfolio. In the fourth quarter of 017, same-store NOI grew 9.3% year-over-year and core NOI margin expanded to 66.1%. Same-store revenues grew 4.8% and same-store expenses declined 2.6%. The expense decline was driven by lower than expected real estate tax assessments and 7.4% lower controllable costs due to continued realization of savings on personnel costs and leasing and marketing costs, as well as lower repair and maintenance and turnover expense. I'll now turn to the legacy Starwood Waypoint same-store portfolio. Same-store core revenues grew 5.4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. NOI grew 4.7%, a solid result considering two non-recurring items that resulted in higher than normal same-store core expense growth of 6.7% in the fourth quarter. First, the impact of our merger on real estate taxes due to California's Prop 13, which was a 50 basis point impact to NOI growth given our significant footprint in California. And second, a favorable real estate tax accrual adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2016 that impacted the year-over-year comparison. Looking at the more comparable full-year results, same-store NOI grew 6.4% in 2017 or 6.5% when adjusting for Prop 13. Core NOI margin expanded to 65.5% for the full-year 2017. One final note about expenses in the quarter, repair and maintenance and turn costs were slightly higher than normal due to the prioritization of hurricane work orders in September that pushed some expenses from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. As a result, core controllable expenses were 3.2% higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter. By contrast, core controllable expenses were down 2.1% for the full-year 2017. Next, I’ll cover leasing trends for the fourth quarter. Same-store rent growth remained strong, with renewals up almost 5% for both Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint. Renewals represented over 60% of the leases we executed in the fourth quarter. At the same time, turnover remained low and in line with the prior year. Same-store new lease growth was 1.6% for Invitation Homes and 0.9% for Starwood Waypoint in the fourth quarter, consistent with expectations in the seasonal trend we see each year. Blended rent growth was 3.6% and 3.3% for Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint respectively. We are also off to a great start in 2018. For the combined 2018 same-store portfolio, January renewal growth accelerated to 5.1%. January new lease rent growth was 1%, resulting in solid blended rent growth of 3.5%. Renewal notices for March and April have been quoted in the low 5% range, and leads on our resident website remains up materially versus the prior year. Before turning it over to Ernie, I would like to take a moment to say thank you to all of our team members and vendor partners in the field. Together, you provide our communities with more choices when it comes to housing and provide our thousands of residents with the opportunity to live the lifestyle they prefer in safe neighborhoods close to their jobs and great schools. And you have continued to innovate and enhance our property management operations to provide our residents with an even more outstanding level of care and service, resulting in high resident satisfaction. I'm proud of what we have accomplished so far, and I look forward to working with all of you to take our resident experience to the next level as the new Invitation Homes. I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Ernie Freedman.
Ernest Freedman: Thank you, Charles. Today, I will cover the following topics: portfolio activity for the fourth quarter, balance sheet and capital markets activity, financial results for the fourth quarter and 2018 guidance. Total home count at the end of 2017 was 82,570 homes. Home count increased by 34,670 due to our merger with Starwood Waypoint. In addition, we continued to recycle capital in the fourth quarter, buying 290 homes for an estimated $80 million and selling 257 homes for $58 million. Our average acquisition basis was $278,000 versus our average disposition price of $225,000. I'll now turn to an update on our balance sheet and capital markets activity. As we communicated previously, both companies were committed to working toward investment-grade balance sheets prior to our merger, and that remains the case. Debt markets remain highly favorable for issuance, and we were able to take advantage with favorable pricing on two new securitizations that allowed us to refinance and extend maturities. In November, we closed the industry's first 7-year securitization loan with a principal amount of $865 million at a total cost of funds of LIBOR plus 150. We used net proceeds to repay in full two of our 2019 maturities. In February, we closed another 7-year securitization with a principal amount of $917 million at total cost of funds of LIBOR plus 124. We used net proceeds to repay in full all of our remaining 2019 secured debt maturities. As a result, we have pushed our nearest term maturity to the first quarter of 2020, with the exception of $230 million of convertible notes maturing in the third quarter of 2019. In addition, our November and February refinancings are expected to decrease interest expense by approximately $9 million annually and increased our unencumbered home pool by over 5,600 homes. Approximately 80% of our debt remains fixed or swapped to fixed rate. We also had over $1.1 billion of liquidity at year-end through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facility. I'll now touch briefly on our fourth quarter 2017 financial results. Core FFO and AFFO for the fourth quarter increased to $0.29 and $0.24 per share, respectively, each exceeding our expectations, due in large part to better-than-expected same-store NOI growth as well as the accretive impact of our merger. Included in our fourth quarter GAAP financials, but not included in core FFO and AFFO, is an incremental $5.5 million accrual for additional homes identified in the fourth quarter that experienced hurricane damage and revised repair estimates. Supplemental Schedule 1 provides a reconciliation from GAAP net loss to our reported FFO, core FFO and AFFO. The next thing I will cover is guidance for the full-year 2018. As Fred and Charles discussed, we believe that we continue to have strong fundamental tailwinds at our back. As such, we expect to grow same-store NOI by 5% to 6% in 2018, with same-store core revenue growth of 4% to 5% and same-store core expense growth of 2% to 3%. Full-year 2018 core FFO is expected to be $1.13 to $1.21 per share, up 13% at the midpoint from 2017. AFFO is expected to be $0.94 to $1.02 per share, up 12% at the midpoint from 2017. This forecast for continued strong growth prompted our board to increase our quarterly dividend 38% to $0.11 per share per quarter. The expected increases in core FFO and AFFO per share are primarily attributable to expected higher NOI, lower interest expense and synergy earn-in, as detailed on the bridge in the full year 2018 guidance section of our earnings release. In line with our initial expectations, we have identified $45 million to $50 million of total cost synergies, of which we expect to realize 75% on a run rate basis by the end of 2018. The majority of this synergies in 2018 and especially those impacting NOI, are expected to be realized later in the year after the implementation of an enhanced operating platform for our field and corporate teams that combines the best of both legacy organizations. As a result, we expect synergy realization to be more impactful to earnings growth in 2019 than in 2018. In 2018, we expect synergies to add $0.03 to $0.04 per share to core FFO and AFFO and for these synergies to be almost entirely related to property management and G&A. As of today, we have earned an approximately $20 million of synergies which includes $9 million of share-based compensation expense, mainly due to headcount synergies. Because there are some moving parts in the 2018 as a result of the merger, I'd like to call attention to a handful of modeling items. First, in 2018, we will no longer provide legacy Starwood Waypoint same-store results. In order to provide what we believe to be the most relevant indicator of comparable performance year-over-year, we have modified our definition of same-store to allow us to include homes that came to Invitation Homes through the merger. As of January 1, 2018, our same-store pool consisted of approximately 72,000 homes or 88% of our total portfolio. Second, while there are minor tweaks to accounting geography to marry the two companies' reporting practices, we do not expect the organization of our financial statements or the definitions of key non-GAAP measures like NOI to change materially from the way Invitation Homes has treated them historically. Third, we will incur a number of non-recurring costs related to our integration efforts in 2018, such as severance and retention, consulting fees and system migration costs. These costs will be recorded in GAAP G&A and property management expense and removed from core FFO and AFFO on the merger and transaction-related expenses line of our reconciliation, with the exception of severance expense, which will continue to be reflected on the severance expense line of our reconciliation. Fourth, the utility billing program that Starwood Waypoint used will be the model for Invitation Homes going forward. Residents will continue to be responsible for costs associated with their water and sewer usage and trash removal. Local providers will invoice Invitation Homes directly instead of our residents. For the next couple of years, this will result in a materially higher year-over-year utility expense in our financial statements as this rolls out across our portfolio as residents move out, offset by corresponding resident reimbursements. In presenting core revenue and core expenses results in our supplemental statements and for the basis of our guidance, we'll remove the impact of this gross-up. Before turning it over to Q&A, I'd like to reiterate how excited we are about 2018. We're off to a great start and our teams are working enthusiastically together to keep the momentum going and further solidify Invitation Homes as the preeminent leader in the single-family rental sector. With that, operator, would you please open up the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Richard Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey. This is Ronald Kamdem on for Richard Hill. First one, kind of going back to the new lease rent growth. Obviously, I appreciate that there's some seasonality in the 4Q and it's seasonally a little bit weaker. But I was just wondering if there's any color why there was, if I compare the 1.6% versus what you did in 4Q of the previous year, was there any additional color into why there may have been potential weakness there? That would be helpful.
Charles Young: Yes. This is Charles. Thanks for the question. I'll give you a couple of comments. As you mentioned, seasonality is definitely part of the new lease impact in Q4 and Q1. But we're always trying to balance rent growth – new lease rent growth and occupancy during those periods. And what I'd point out is the Invitation Homes portfolio actually gained 20 basis points in occupancy during the period. So if you listen back to the last call, there was actually a conscious effort to go into the quarter making sure that we're strong on occupancy and balance that out. The other thing I would say is, with the hurricanes that were out there, there's a little bit of hangover in terms of getting those homes back in line, a pause in some of the leasing efforts and days to re-resident increased. And we wanted to push the occupancy back up in the Florida markets. And that's really more of an impact, Florida specifically on the IH portfolio. On the SWAY side, a little bit of a similar experience, but we had a bit more turnover in the summer months, mostly driven by the expiration of the multiyear leases that had limited 3% bumps. And those extra 2,000 expirations pushed up our occupancy. And we were making sure we're catching up, so we gave up a little bit of new lease growth. So the topline results were good overall, but we were trying to balance off the occupancy, which is driving revenues overall.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. That’s helpful. And then just going back to, I think you provided some of the renewals and the new lease rent growth numbers for January and so forth, which is helpful. Second question really is, as you're looking at, thinking about kind of 1Q and kind of the rest of 2018, I was just curious if you can comment on the outlook for what the job growth versus rent growth and how that's going to be driving?
Charles Young: Yes, so overall, look what I'll say is as we look forward and we just talked about trying to drive our occupancy. What I'll talk about with our portfolio is today, January and February have been off to great starts. We're well occupied in most of our markets. We're exactly where we want to be. And what we're able to see now from even the January numbers I gave you is real acceleration of our renewal rent growth going into the end of the quarter here. And as we look into Q2, I could see what's happened in the past is those renewals – the new rent growth starts to catch and/or surpass renewal rent growth. As we talked about, we’ve been quoting north of 5, some markets close to 6 on renewals. So we’re seeing a lot of good momentum in the portfolio in the way we have it positioned today.
Frederick Tuomi: Yes, Ron. This is Fred. I would just add to that. On a macro level, you're right, job growth is a great indicator of future demand for housing units and, in particular, rental housing of all types. And if you look at how the U.S. economy is doing – has been doing recently and is doing now and predicted in the near-term future, the outlook is very positive. So there's a lot of stimulants to job growth. The headline numbers have been very favorable. The unemployment rate is near very low points historically. And all of that just creates more household formation, more mobility across the economy as people go to where those jobs are being created and just more wage growth, et cetera. And all of that are just great indicators for our business going forward. Especially looking at our market footprint, but we're in the high-growth markets, and these are the markets that are people are moving to versus from and where these jobs are being created. So we feel very confident that the fundamentals that we've enjoyed in the last couple of years will continue for the near-term future is just placed on the macro outlook, all things considered.
Ronald Kamdem: Great, my last question, if I may, would just be on leverage. Just if you can just walk us through, how you’re thinking about it. Obviously, you've talked about wanting to get to that investment-grade type balance sheet. Just understanding, is there – should we think about maybe reducing it by a turn over each year? Like how are you guys thinking about the leverage levels and getting to where you want to be?
Ernest Freedman: Sure. This is Ernie. Thanks for the question. First and foremost, we have a very safe balance sheet today, but we do want to progress to having a balance sheet that will garner investment-grade ratings sometime in the future. And we're committed to do it on that path by using cash flow from operations, the low dividend payout ratio, even with our increased dividend that we announced a little bit earlier this year, and use excess cash flow to help bring leverage down. And of course, we've got the great tailwinds of this best-in-class NOI growth and FFO growth that's expected for the single-family sector and what we provide out in the guidance. So through the growth of the bottom line as well as excess cash flow, we would expect to be able to bring our leverage – our net debt-to-EBITDA numbers down about a turn a year over the next period of time. And if there are other opportunities for us to find ways to accelerate that further, we'll certainly give that due consideration.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. Congrats on a great quarter. That’s all from me.
Charles Young: Thank you, Ron.
Frederick Tuomi: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, thanks for the time. Just hoping you could talk a little bit about the integration process, kind of what the key benchmarks and timing of initiatives you guys have outlined or planned for that we should be looking out for. And more specifically on customer service, Starwood Waypoint had a lower customer rating than in INVH. And how do you hope to make that gap up between the two portfolios?
Frederick Tuomi: Well, thank you for the question. This is Fred. I’ll take the first part of it. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the integration is going very smoothly and according to plan. We feel very confident with the plan that we have in place. And now we're deep into the execution phase, which we've all been waiting for. As we mentioned when we first announced the merger, this is a very large undertaking, but we have the team, we have the experience, we have the resources to attack it properly. So we laid out the time line initially being about 18 months for merger close, which was November 16, 2017. And the first few months will be just the planning and enabling work, a few months after that more enabling work and setup and testing and then several months of the full deployment into the field operation. So we're right on track on that schedule. We hope to be able to accelerate it. But we're not going to be anxious to really speed this thing up. We want to do it right. Basically, we're going to measure twice or maybe measure three times and cut once. So this is a great opportunity to blend two large, successful productive companies that were pretty well stabilized, had some very – a lot of similarities, as we mentioned before. They're very almost identical in some aspects, but had unique features in others. So we're blending the best of the two companies. But then, we're not stopping there. We're also looking for new inventions, new innovations, new ways to create the best platform going forward, given 80,000 homes with a very dense market footprint, which we haven't had before. So we're inventing some new concepts along the way versus just putting the two together. We could have done it faster if we put the two together, but we want to build the ultimate platform for future growth and future functionality. So therefore, it's going to take us a little bit longer. But again, we're still right exactly on plan that we have laid out from the beginning. So more to report with each quarter, as Ernie mentioned in his remarks, and we indicated early on that the – most of the earn-in of the synergies that impact NOI versus G&A are going to come later this year and will be fully realized in the early part of 2019. And I'll let Charles talk about our customer service and resident loyalty initiatives.
Charles Young: Yes, great. Thanks Fred. So in terms of resident experience, as we're melding these two organizations, we see this as really another great opportunity to take the best of both firms in terms of process, technology people. Both firms were utilizing surveys to ensure high-quality and professional service. And we both continued to have and continue to have high customer service scores. However, as we all know, customer service is a journey, and we as a leadership team are committed to continue to build a resident-centric culture. The Invitation Homes vision is to continuously enhance the resident living experience, and our new scale will allow us to get to that vision quicker. We have many thousands of families in our homes. And now we can provide even more expanded housing options and choice. We're going to lean in heavily on the ProCare service and Proactive maintenance approach. We're increasing the level of self-performance with our in-house maintenance teams, the ability to utilize the home – the Smart Home technology. We're providing more options. And what's most important is the team out in the field, who I mentioned in my comments, we have our local teams, hundreds of associates in the markets that take great care and pride and provide high-quality service for our residents. So as we continue to survey and iterate and get better and take the best of all that Fred just talked about and building our platform, we see a great opportunity to just get better and better at the customer service culture we want to build.
Frederick Tuomi: Yes, Ron, this is Fred. I would just add to that is that we have literally thousands and thousands of completed surveys from our actual residents living in our homes. And most of these surveys are as a result of direct experiences with our maintenance teams in providing customer services upon their request. And 99.8% of those respondents rate us favorably, a rating of 3, 4 or 5 on a 1 to 5 scale. And our average between the two companies which was identical before and now combined, is a 4.3. So our real customers in the field getting real interactions with our real people on the ground, things are going extraordinarily well. So anybody that does not have a great experience, we're going to take seriously and we're committed to fix, but we're doing a good job now, and it will only get better.
Juan Sanabria: And just on the revenue side of the business, for lease optimization, that was a focus for Invitation Homes at that portfolio. Where are you? And is there any benefit that's accruing in 2018 in your guidance? Or is that – would that be a benefit over and above where your guidance is set out at?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. Juan, this is Dallas. In terms of the revenue management systems, both companies had really good systems in place that we're starting with from day one. As you're aware, on the INVH side, we've done some tweaking last year in terms of the lease expiration curve. And we're in a pretty good shape going into 2018 in terms of where expirations currently occur. Expect us to do a little bit more work in that regard. But we've got a little bit of tweaking to do, but it's really at the sub-market level, and just finding better ways to optimize and create better synergies across how the portfolio is going to behave in terms of those expiration counts.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. And last quick one for me on churn. Have you guys seen any pickup, we’ve seen some of the homeownership stats pop up particularly for the first homebuyers. Any signs there that that's filtering through to your business and may create higher expenses as a result of the churn?
Ernest Freedman: Juan, we're not seeing that today. Turnovers have been consistent year-over-year reason for move-out, the home purchases remains the top reason. But actually, on a year-over-year basis, it's down from where it was last year. Not enough to say I'd call it a trend. But it's held steady for the portfolio at about 25%, so we are not seeing any negative consequences from that.
Juan Sanabria: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate the bridge from 2017 result to 2018. But if you take the fourth quarter core FFO, $0.29, and I recognize there's some seasonality and tax accruals involved in that, but it only includes kind of the partial impact from the SFR deal. It's missing some of the synergies that are expected to earn in through 2018 and the interest expense savings that you spoke about earlier. You get to $1.16 on an annualized basis. So just trying to understand kind of what's assumed in guidance kind of above and beyond the fourth quarter run rate.
Ernest Freedman: Sure. So Nick, you kind of laid out the reasons why you can’t take the $0.29 multiplied by four. Specifically in the fourth quarter, we had some good guys in real estate taxes on the Invitation Homes portfolio that added $0.01 to the $0.29. And that was because at the end of the day, we had over-accrued for real estate tax expectations in Florida and Georgia. Both of those jurisdictions don't send out their bills until November and December. And in hindsight, we were overly conservative as to where we thought those would come out. So $0.29 would actually be $0.28 in the fourth quarter if it weren't for that. You also have to take out another $0.01 to $0.015 because fourth quarter is always the highest margin quarter for us for two reasons. One, it's one of our lowest turnover quarters; and two, it's not HVAC season. HVAC season for the second quarter and the third quarter in turnover drives those margins higher. So take another $0.01 to $0.015 for that, you're really at a number for the fourth quarter that, if we were trying to annualize for run rate purposes, is closer to $0.26 to $0.026. And multiply that out, that gets you out to kind like a $1.06, $1.07, $1.08, that range. And then you have the things you see on our bridge that gets there. So a couple of favorable things have happened in the fourth quarter and the fourth quarter is always going to be seasonally one of our strongest quarters from a margin perspective.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate that. And then you mentioned the additional upside from best practices, are there any assumed in guidance? And what would you expect the timing to be?
Ernest Freedman: Yes. I think with regard to the best practices, the things that we're starting to give some thought to are things not assumed in the guidance. And one – a good example would be around procurement. We are spending a lot of time working with some of our national vendors and regional vendors to see if we can lower our cost to obtain goods and services. And so we've talked about, and Fred mentioned, the NOI synergies that we're talking about are really baked into the second half of the year and towards the second half of the second half of the year around personnel synergies. The good news is with things like procurement, we can earn those in a little bit earlier if we get those contracts renegotiated. So we like – we're optimistic there's some upside that we provided and maybe some of that upside comes in a little bit earlier. But it's a little bit early in the year for us to change our thoughts and provide any further upside than what we provide at this point. But as we progress through the year, we're hopeful we'll have good news to report on that front.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. And just finally, for same-store revenue for 2018. I know it will be the combined portfolios for that 4% to 5%. Are you expecting any differences between the legacy SFR versus the legacy Invitation Homes portfolio?
Ernest Freedman: No, Nick, we're really running them as one portfolio, and they're right on top of each other. 83% of the homes, great concentration in the Western U.S. and Florida, the markets we want to be in. And so we haven't, Nick, prepared our budgets that way to say, well, how the legacy portfolio is looking nor are we trying to report it that way. But because the overlap is as much as it is, I think it's fair to assume that there would be very similar expectations.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks.
Ernest Freedman: You got it.
Operator: The next question is from David Corak of B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
David Corak: Hey. Good morning, guys. Ernie, what sort of external growth is built into the FFO guidance? Maybe you can talk a little bit about kind of the go-forward strategy in general. And then, Dallas, if you can comment on what you're seeing in the market. If anything has kind of changed in your world in the past few months.
Ernest Freedman: Yes. I'm happy to address the first part of that, and I'll turn it over to Dallas for the second. In terms of what we're thinking for capital allocation more broadly, including external growth, we think it will be kind of a net neutral year for us. And you could probably see us buy a few hundred million to $0.5 billion – a few hundred million dollars worth of homes, and maybe a few hundred million to about $0.5 billion worth of sales on a net basis kind of gets you back to that same number. So that's where we're going to start out the year. But you know this team can be very opportunistic, and we look at every opportunity that comes up. And if the right opportunity pops up, you could see us pivot from that, like we did in 2017, when the two organizations came together. We think this will be more of a quieter year, where we can self-fund that capital allocation activity by selling – culling the portfolio and selling some of our weaker assets and using those proceeds to either delever or to buy better assets. And Dallas will have all the tools and the tool kit to do that. But on a net basis, that activity has very little impact to FFO and AFFO. They kind of cancel each other out from an accretion perspective.
Dallas Tanner: Yes, thanks, David for the question. I agree with everything that Ernie just laid out in terms of strategy going forward. Generally is, I think most people on the call understand the market is still really tight. We're seeing a lot of activity in the space from not only, call it, single-family rental companies, but there are a lot of end users that are still out there trying to buy homes. So generally speaking, if you look the markets that we’re in and one area of emphasis for us continues to be in higher barrier to entry sub-markets and parts of markets we're going to see outperformance in terms of growth. And so as you look at markets like Seattle, we've seen many of our sub-markets, 9% to 10% home price appreciation in the past year. We're seeing rent growth, as Charles laid out earlier in the call north of 6% and so we’re pretty bullish in terms of the fundamentals of the markets that we're in, but we recognize that it is still a little bit tight. So we have to – fortunately, we have people on the ground in our asset management investment teams, and so we're very local and we do get the opportunity to look at opportunities here and there in kind of a unique fashion. But generally speaking, the market is healthy, very tight, and we like the fundamentals of the markets that we're in.
David Corak: Are there any markets in the portfolio now that are kind of underperformers that you would expect to see a drastic improvement in 2018 or vice versa?
Dallas Tanner: Yes, I mean look, we’d love to see a little bit more growth out of our Midwest concentration. Generally speaking, we haven’t seen the home price appreciation or a lot of the rent growth that you want to see the market push away. We are seeing better gains in occupancy. And Charles and his team are doing a terrific job there. I think we are excited about some of the markets that came in because of the merger, markets like Denver, Dallas and Asheville all feel like they're very high-growth profile markets for the coming years. And so you could expect us to maybe at some point, once we get through the integration, some of those things, find ways to grow and expand those portfolios.
David Corak: Fair enough. And the last quick one for me just going back to the timing of the synergies and the fact that kind of back-end weighted, to some extent, and the NOI won't hit until 2019. Just given some of the moving pieces there, could you give us an actual dollar amount of NOI benefit that you would expect to see in 2019 versus 2018? I mean, we can kind of back into a range certainly, but just trying to get a sense of what OpEx looks like in 2019 versus 2018?
Ernest Freedman: Yes, sure, David, we've given our guidance that we expect synergies overall to be about $45 million to $50 million over the life as we roll these in. And about third of those are going to come from NOI, and very little of that is going to hit, really hit, really, on an actual basis in 2018. So you take a third of the roughly $48 million, the midpoint that I gave, that's about $16 million, and the majority of that is going to hit on a run rate basis in 2019. So I'd say $14 million to $15 million on the size of our same-store portfolio, that's about 150 bps of NOI growth for next year. Without providing that guidance, that's the math.
David Corak: Thanks a lot. All right, thanks guys.
Operator: The next question is from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Please go ahead.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks. Can you comment on what you anticipate for full-year same-store CapEx per property in 2018 and it looks like it's a negative $0.01 decrement to AFFO?
Ernest Freedman: Sure. We think our CapEx for the two portfolios run at slightly different levels. As we combine them. We think we'll get to a blend, Jade. So it will probably going to be – and I would guess, in the $1,200 to $1,400 per home range for CapEx. We think total cost to maintain is going to run kind of consistent to where they have with the two portfolios in they kind of mid-2s to the $2,800 type range. So that's cost to maintain, and that's where we think CapEx will be.
Jade Rahmani: And just from a broader perspective, what do see as the main challenges from a portfolio management point of view in terms of this larger, local and enterprise scale? Is it to do with juggling centralization, how much centralization to have across the organization or maintaining adequacy of staffing and capacity or is it really the data collection side, I guess, in terms of the challenges of managing a larger portfolio?
Frederick Tuomi: Well, thanks for the question. Yes, this is Fred. That's what we wrestle with every day and that's really with early in this business, it was undefined. And when I first started this business, gosh, it's been almost five years ago now. There was no road map. But over time, necessity is the mother of invention, and there was a lot of necessity back then. But I think we've struck a great balance now and we have designed our platform to achieve the right balance in terms of how do you operate a large-scale portfolio across multiple markets, but maintain consistency, maintain accuracy and timely reporting and all the things that you want when you're running a large-scale, long-term sustainable business. And that’s what our platform is designed for from the ground up. A lot of that didn't exist in the single-family rental space. We invented it. We created it. And now we're enjoying the benefits of it. But we'll always be continually innovating it and making it better. And this merger gives us a tremendous opportunity, a big leg up of running 80,000 homes in large concentration markets with 90% of our markets having – the average of 4,800 per market and 90% having 2,000 or more. So that gives us a great opportunity to continue to refine it, which we're doing. In terms of centralized versus decentralized, most of our control center is centralized, and we continue through this merger of identifying the best practices between the two companies. And in most cases, we're increasing the amount of administrative support and consistency and kind of defining the methodologies from a centralized basis. And then the people in the field are dedicated solely to customer interaction, the customer life cycle, that being attraction, acquisition onboarding and ongoing service. So they're focus on customer service and not have to be bothered with the administrative work that's being done by people in the central office.
Charles Young: And Jade, I just would add, I think that your question really, I look at it as the power and the benefit of the scale and the efficiency that we're able to create. As Fred mentioned, you get the best practices that we can use centrally to standardize. But locally, we have our teams on the ground to be able to give that great experience to our customers and our residents. But specifically, the overlap and efficiency of minimizing windshield time, being able to self-perform at higher levels and get to the homes and service the homes and create convenience for our residents is where the benefit comes from the larger scale. So we're trying to find our right balance between centralization and standardization as well as giving that high-touch experience on the ground.
Jade Rahmani: And just lastly in terms of maintenance work orders, what percentage are you targeting to perform with internal personnel?
Charles Young: Yes, with the combined portfolio, we think we'll be in the 50% to 60% range of self-performance with optimization and using technology, we hope to push to the higher end of that range. And then, we'll see where we go after we settle in. But that's around where Invitation Homes was before, and that's an increase from where the Starwood Waypoint portfolio was. So we see this as being a benefit overall.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks for taking the questions.
Frederick Tuomi: Thanks Jade.
Operator: The next question is from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Dennis McGill: Hi, thank you, guys. Ernie, first question on the revenue guidance, the 4% to 5%. How would you break that down between expectations around rent, occupancy and then the other income?
Ernest Freedman: Yes, sure. It's going to be, I think, somewhat similar to what you saw in 2017 with regards to what we're going to do for rental rate achievement on new and renewal leases, which for the portfolio was in the low 4s on a blended basis. And we expect it sort of to be similar there. We expect maybe a slight uptick in occupancy. And then you'll see other income growth start to slow down from where it's been in the past when you take out the noise from the utility reimbursement program that's being rolled out across both portfolios. And that's how you kind of get to a midpoint of about – our midpoint of 4.5% in our guidance range.
Dennis McGill: Okay. When I look at the markets across the two portfolios, most of them on the fourth quarter pricing power seem to be pretty well aligned. Two, so that would be Atlanta and Charlotte, I guess, that were stronger in the SFR side. What was the driver or what is the driver of the difference in performance in those two portfolios there?
Charles Young: Yes, So Atlanta, some of it is pricing between the portfolios, kind of the level. But today, they're both performing really well. I think you get some periods where a quarter will be up or down. But where we look at it today, and we combine them or add 96% in that portfolio puts us in great position going forward. The Charlotte portfolio, little bit of seasonality that happens we on the SFR side had more of the challenge as we were trying to scale that market and grow, half of our homes were purchased in 2017, and we're digesting that. When you put the two portfolios together, over 4,000 homes, it's now a very strong market and occupancy north of or right around 95% on the combined portfolio. So both of them, although they had a little bit of a slower Q4, as I said, January and February have been off to great starts, and both markets are looking really strong now.
Dennis McGill: Okay. And then in Atlanta, when you said pricing, did you mean different price points in Atlanta or just the price levels?
Charles Young: Yes. So as you take such a large portfolio and put it together, there are certain different demands on price points and how quickly you get there. When you put now the combined together, working with Dallas and his team to try to optimize that portfolio, we can really keep in and focus on the best of the best.
Dennis McGill: Okay. Got it. Ernie, on the expense guidance, can you may be just talk about the big buckets as far as what's plus or minus, that 2% to 3% range.
Ernest Freedman: Yes, sure. So really, the two buckets are real estate taxes and everything else. With real estate taxes, we expect those to go up 5% without the impact of Prop 13 on the homes that came over in the merger from Starwood Waypoint. Because we do have the Prop 13 adjustment, we actually expect real estate taxes in total to go up about 6.5% year-over-year. So Prop 13 by itself adds 150 bps to our real estate tax expectations. So on a base case, it's 5%. With Prop 13, it’s 6.5%. All the other expenses, Dennis, there's some ups and downs. But they're basically going to be flat or slightly down. And you blend that together based on the proportion of those expenses. That's how you get to the 2% to 3% range for operating expenses.
Dennis McGill: Well the Prop 13 adjustment be considered same-store or will you back that out?
Frederick Tuomi: So the Prop 13 will be in same-store, yes. It's a real economic item. And because we changed the definition of same-store to incorporate those homes, we'll keep – we'll be reporting it in those numbers. So that is contemplated in our overall guidance.
Dennis McGill: Okay. And then last question, can you just give us an update on all the homes that were damaged in the hurricanes and taken out of the pool? Where do we sit with those as far as vacancy and repairs and being able to generate revenue again?
Frederick Tuomi: Yes. So in terms of overall work orders, both portfolios are about 95% complete on and working through those. The SWAY portfolio, SFR portfolio, obviously had more of a – a larger number of high-damage homes with the flooding in Houston. There were about 115 to 130 homes that were in that. Most of those are coming back online this quarter. And so we're leasing those up in Houston as we speak. Houston is maintaining good occupancy, but we need to absorb those homes. It took a while with those homes because of the water damage. We had to let them dry out and then bring them back on. And they were larger repairs. But generally, we've worked through it. Some of the cost of that, as I have mentioned, has started to show up in Q4, and we'll get a little bit of that showing up in Q1 as well as we finalize. But the occupancy impact, we've pretty much rather gotten by, as we talked about it in Q4 and we are off to the races here in Q1.
Dennis McGill: So as you look forward, all of those homes that were taken out of use would either be leased or leasable here by the end of the quarter?
Frederick Tuomi: Yes. That will be put back in service. Whether we have them fully leased by the end of the quarter, we'll see where we are based on timing and when we get them. But most of the Houston homes are back. Specific numbers – they're coming back each week. And most of the hundred will be back in line this quarter and hopefully rented either this quarter or next.
Ernest Freedman: Dennis, as a reminder, we have business interruption insurance to help cover that and bridge that gap for us between while they're empty until they're leased.
Dennis McGill: Okay. Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: The next question is from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey. Good morning, I guess. Couple of quick ones here. I guess, first, for you, Ernie, on the balance sheet, I appreciate the color earlier on your thinking. But curious how some of your thought process might be evolving here in light of rising rates, right? LIBOR is up 80 basis points year-over-year or so. You've got upcoming maturities. 20% of your debt is floating with low rates. You've got some hedges that are burning off going into 2019 or 2020. So I guess that I’m thinking – my question is, are you inclined to be a bit more aggressive this year in terms of the debt reduction beyond the organic EBITDA driven reduction you’ve outlined, while the wind is at your back, rates are low, your earnings growth is still outsized versus the sector? Or is that perhaps 2019, where you think you'll be more aggressive in starting that process of the refinancing, the deleveraging?
Ernest Freedman: Sure, Haendel. You said this was a quick one, we could spend many, many minutes talking about this. But at a high level, I’d say, we are going to be opportunistic. And we have taken care of all our 2019 maturities other than a convertible note that comes due in the middle of next year. But we have maturities coming up in 2020, and it would make sense for us to be opportunistic with those. And so we will consider during the year. We think it makes sense and we can lock in some good rates, whether it's through fixed rate financing or doing it through interest rate swaps, as we've done in the past. We want to take advantage of when the markets are open. And certainly, rates have gone up. But certainly, rates are historically low still relative to where they've been for many, many years, not as low as they've been in the last couple of years, of course. So just like Dallas will be on the acquisition side, we'll be opportunistic as we think about capital allocation. I'll be working very close with Jon Olsen and his team here. And we'll hit the markets when it makes sense for us, and we want to continue to lock in what are favorable rates even at today's higher rates for the longer term.
Haendel St. Juste: Are you more inclined to add more fixed? And what type of overall proportion are you currently thinking about in terms of fixed versus floating?
Ernest Freedman: Yes. In overall, I don’t focus so much on that, Haendel. I do focus on how much is fixed versus floating, but how we get there, whether it's through swaps or we get there through fixed rate financing as we decide what's the better course and what's more opportunistic and economically feasible. But we do want to maintain probably no more than about 20% of our debt exposures being floating. So you could certainly see us actually decrease that as we go through and potentially lock in some rates that maybe we get closer to 90% fix versus the 80% we are today. But we feel comfortable at 80%, but whether it’s using fix rate financing or it’s using swaps, there's pros and cons to both in terms of flexibility. And as we try to pivot our balance sheet from where it is today to one that will be investment-grade, we want to keep optionality and weigh economics against that.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it, and couple of quick ones for you, Charles. The insurance reserve during the quarter, up $5.5 million, I think I understand what's going on there. But maybe some color there and then when do you expect to get some of the recovery proceeds, the insurance recovery proceeds? Is that this year or next year? And will those be reported in or out of the same store?
Charles Young: I’m going to let Ernie to take this.
Ernest Freedman: Yes, Haendel, I'll handle that more from how the insurance will work. So the recent increase during the fourth quarter is that as we got out to additional homes, where we're doing our asset management work and as homes turned, it turned out there was damage from the storms that our residents had not reported to us, whether it was more minor damage or they just didn't think to do it. As we identified as homes, that drove the accrual up and we're building a cushion for that when we put our accruals in the third quarter. But in hindsight, we didn't build in enough cushion. And so that’s why you saw the increase related mainly to the Florida properties, not so much in Houston, but a little bit there, too, increase across the portfolio, about $4.5 million and we’ve built some contingency in there. So we hope that we need to come back for one more bite at the apple here in the first quarter, but we'll have to see as the next couple of months wrap up. In terms of actually collecting insurance proceeds it had – likely the earliest we’d collect insurance proceeds at the end of 2018. Some times these things should actually go even a little bit longer. But I would expect that most of it is cleared up by the end of this year. And with regards to whether that – it's really not – there's not a P&L impact for that, any casualty losses from an same-store perspective Haendel, any casualty losses we book below the line. And any recoveries we have we'll also book below the line. So you won’t see a positive nor negative impact to same-store from what we actually recover. And we expect the recoveries to be somewhat modest because almost all of the damage that was done was below deductible amounts.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Appreciate the color guys. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Fred or Ernie, I’m just curious when you sit down with the board and you set out to capital allocation and balance sheet plan for 2018. How did the sell-off in your share price in the broader REIT market since the fall impact the discussion? How that changed the plan at all?
Frederick Tuomi: Yes. Hey, John. Yes, thanks for the question. As Ernie mentioned previously, the capital allocation for 2018 and going forward, we take a long-term look at that. And the goals are to continue to enhance our quality of our portfolio through the right balance of acquisition, dispositions and ongoing revenue-enhancing CapEx. But we still see growth in our sector, and that's a key point. Regardless of the interest rate market or what share price might be doing at any given day on a short-term. We still see significant path of growth coming from this sector going forward for several years. So we want to capture that that growth. The best way to arm yourself versus uncertain environments on the macro is through growth. Second is to reduce the leverage. We continue to fortify our already strong balance sheet and our path towards investment grade. And then always, we're extremely opportunistic. We've been an active consolidator in this space so far, and in addition to the ground gating we have going every day, we'll continue to be open and flexible to large-scale opportunities as they come. And we have the balance sheet and the firepower to take advantage of those opportunities better than anyone else. And we have a powerful board. I mean, our board is comprised of some significant real estate successful people. They're forward thinking. They like to think big. And we're going to take advantage of our board to give us the proper guidance when needed. So in terms of here and now, the recent share price volatility is a factor, and we'll be talking a lot about that with our board, upcoming board meeting. But it’s a recent phenomenon. We have to look at these things over longer period of time. So we’re not going to take action just based on very recent type of volatility and share price, but we’ll look at those allocations of our capital available to us and look at all options with the board and make the best decision for our shareholders going forward.
John Pawlowski: Make sense. And then Fred, a repeal of Costa Hawkins seems very likely to make it to the voter's ballot this November. I know the apartment REITs are raising funds to battle the measure. Is Invitation Homes doing anything to try to get ahead of it, one? And two, if the state restrictions on rent control are lifted next year, how worried about pricing power in California are you?
Frederick Tuomi: Yes, the issue of rent controls, I’ve been in this business for 30 years and it does come up fairly frequently over time. And fortunately, we've been able to resist that that type of move which would be very unfortunate for not only the real estate markets, but I think for the residents of those states and for the people looking for high-quality, stable rental housing. But the real issue out there, as I'm sure you know, is really not rent control, it's supply of housing. And the fundamental issue is the legal systems of many of these states have significant roadblocks to housing supply that impacts in the time to deliver and, most importantly, the cost to build new housing. So we are going to focus our efforts on trying to educate the public and the legislators that we need to find more supply. We have to deliver more supply for people looking at housing as household formation continues to expand, and we need lower cost housing, more affordable housing of all types that need to be available in the market. But these things do come up from time to time. As you know, in California, the Costa Hawkins was the preemptive law across the state, prohibiting rent control, and that was put in place for a reason. They had the foresight to know that that's not a good solution to housing. And there was a bill, 1506, seeking to propose in legislation to repeal it. That bill failed to advance in assembly. And now there are some private groups trying to mobilize a ballot initiative, and they're gathering signatures as we speak. Something similar in the State of Washington, although that one is the preemptive law, the repeal of that died in committee. And then in Illinois, there's still one pending. So yes, the real estate industry is watching this and monitoring it. The rental business, meaning apartments, manufactured housing, senior, students and single-family, are all working together to monitor the situation and will be joined together to respond to the issue if it continues to grow.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Obviously, you’ve in the rental housing industry for a while. In short, is this time different? How much more concerned are you this time around versus the last several times that this thing has come up?
Frederick Tuomi: Yes. It varies. Sometimes in the past, it wasn't much. It was just a few voices. Other times I can remember during the dot.com bubble, there were pretty loud voices on that and it was – seemed pretty imminent. This time, I think it is probably more similar to that, and maybe with a little more fervor and a little bit more – now with the Internet, the people to get their ideas, no matter what they are, good or bad, the ability to get them out in the public is enhanced. So there's just more of an intense marketing effort on both sides of the issue.
John Pawlowski: Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question is from Buck Horne of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Buck Horne: Thanks. Good morning. Kind of a higher-level question. Just trying to think through some of the fundamentals here. Home prices in your markets are accelerating north of 6%, probably better than that. And in a lot of places, mortgage rates are rising right now. You're looking at going into the spring time with REIT sale inventory levels probably some of the lowest levels historically on record. So I mean, all those costs of ownership are going higher faster than rent levels that you guys are implying with your fiscal 2018. How do you think about pushing the envelope in terms of pricing this year and maybe accelerating your renewals or how do you think about that equation?
Frederick Tuomi: Yes, but – this is Fred. Long-term, a lot of the issues you just described are correct, and they're favorable for us. That's what gives us some of the tailwind. But you have to be careful just – you can’t just immediately start – stepping on the gas in terms of pricing. It's not that easy. We have to price our homes appropriately given the local markets, what's going on in each sub-market, supply, demand, pricing, competitors, et cetera. We can’t just unilaterally set pricing and expect to achieve, it’s a balance. It’s a balance of equilibrium between supply and demand, occupancy, future demand expectations et cetera. So we do the best job, I think, in the industry of monitoring that. We have sophisticated tools and platforms. We have educated people on the ground and at our central office, monitoring these things. And we make the – choose the right balance between rates and occupancy every single day as we prices our product. So home price appreciation continues to grow. It does that help us? Sure. But it's not an immediate. There's a lag factor to that. If the price of housing goes up over time, the price of all housing adjusts to follow, whether its ownership or rental. So generally, it's a more smooth long-term trend versus an immediate ability to just set a price.
Buck Horne: Okay, appreciate that added color there. Maybe one for Ernie, just I'm looking through some of the line items, and I just noticed, I guess in the Starwood same-store pool, some of the property management costs are still above the NOI line. So when you guys combine the new presentation for fiscal 2018, will any of those property management costs get reorganized either above or below the NOI line?
Ernest Freedman: Yes, Buck, they will. We're going to present as we've done in Invitation Homes historically going forward. So you'll see exactly that happen that we'll reclass of the 2017 number. So we have like-to-like results and then do same-store pool that we're pulling together, so there won't be any noise from differences like that.
Buck Horne: Got it, that’s helpful. Thank you.
Frederick Tuomi: All right, thanks. End of Q&A
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Fred Tuomi for closing remarks.
Frederick Tuomi: Great. Yes, I want to thank everybody for joining us here today. We appreciate your interest in Invitation Homes and we’ll see many of you at the upcoming conference season that progresses through the year. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Invitation Homes Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Greg Van Winkle, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greg Van Winkle: Thank you, Jasmine. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. On today's call from Invitation Homes are John Bartling, Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; Dallas Tanner, Chief Investment Officer; and Bruce Lavine, Chief Operations Officer. I'd like to point everyone to our third quarter 2017 earnings press release and supplemental information, which we may reference on today's call. This document can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.invh.com. Finally, I'd like to inform you that certain statements made during the call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements. We describe some of these risk and uncertainties in our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K, our merger proxy filed on October 16, 2017 and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. During this call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with the most comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release and supplemental information, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, John Bartling.
John Bartling: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As we near the anticipated closing of our merger with Starwood Waypoint Homes, I'm happy to report that we had another strong quarter of great financial and operating results on top of what has been a very active and transformational year for Invitation Homes. 2017 financial performance is progressing in line with our expectations, with third quarter same-store NOI up 8.1% and AFFO up 28.3% year-over-year. Rent growth remained strong with renewal rates up 5% again. At the same time, turnover moved even lower, a testament to the quality of our locations, product, service and people. In addition, we continue to find success of elevating the efficiency of our platform, achieving 18% growth in other income and a 3% reduction in controllable costs during the third quarter. Looking ahead, supply and demand fundamentals remain favorable in our markets. This is evidenced by our strong rent growth, especially in the Western U.S., where we saw same-store blended rent growth of almost 7% in Q3. Home price appreciation remains strong as well with prices in Invitation Homes market up 6.5% year-over-year, 50 basis points better than the national average. Against this macro fundamental backdrop, along with strong financial results we achieved in the first three quarters of 2017, we believe we are on track to deliver same-store NOI growth for the full year of 6.8% to 7.2%. Also of note this quarter was the way we responded to Hurricane Irma. We are particularly appreciative of how quickly our associates moved to assist our Florida and Atlanta residents in the wake of the storm. Thankfully, no injuries to residents or associates were reported. In line with our initial estimates, we have accrued $16 million of casualty loss expense, a small portion of which should be recoverable through insurance. Finally, a few words on our proposed merger. We remain on track to close the transaction before the end of the year with Starwood Waypoint shareholder's vote scheduled for November 14. As mentioned in August, we believe bringing together these two portfolios and innovative platforms will create the preeminent single-family REIT in the United States. With 70% of our revenues generated from high-growth Western and Florida regions and almost $2 billion in renovations, Invitation Homes will be well positioned to benefit from the growing demand for single-family rental housing in the U.S. as well as the inherent synergies in enhanced resident services that come with additional scale. This is a win-win for both residents and shareholders. As we get closer to the closing date, it is worth noting that both Boards and integration teams are working well together. The processes to bring the companies together post-close are running smoothly as we work diligently to efficiently manage 82,000 homes. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Ernie Freedman.
Ernie Freedman: Thank you, John. Today, I will cover the following topics: operating results for the third quarter and October, portfolio activity for the third quarter, financial results for the third quarter, balance sheet and capital markets activity and updated 2017 guidance. The third quarter of 2017 was another good quarter for us operationally. Total portfolio NOI grew 8.3% year-over-year, and we experienced this NOI growth despite a slight decrease in home count. For our same-store portfolio of 42,795 homes, NOI growth accelerated to 8.1%. Same-store revenues grew 4.7%, consistent with the first half of the year, driven by average rental rate growth of 4.2% and other income growth of 17.8%. Same-store occupancy remained high, averaging 95.4% in the third quarter and ending the quarter at 95.8%. Same-store expenses declined 0.3% in the controllable portion of expenses, as noted on Supplemental Schedule 3(b), declined even more at 2.9%. Personnel costs were 15.4% lower, turnover costs were 9.1% lower and leasing and marketing costs were 7.4% lower year-over-year. Blended net effective rental rate growth was 4.3% in the third quarter. Renewal rent growth remained firm at 5%. At the same time, annualized turnover declined 150 basis points year-over-year at 38.1%, a great result, especially considering that third quarter is a seasonally higher turnover period in our business. On new leases, we achieved 3.4% growth. Northern and Southern California, Seattle and Phoenix were our strongest growing regions with same-store blended rent growth between 6.5% and 8%. In October, blended net effective rental rate growth declined seasonally, as expected, to 3.7%. Average occupancy for the month was 95.4%, 10 bps higher than October of 2016. October turnover annualized was 33.3%. Newer asks for November and December went out at over 6% on average and we've realized approximately 5% on those signed thus far. I'll now move on to our portfolio activity. In the third quarter of 2017, the total number of homes in our portfolio increased by 142 to 47,867 homes. We continue to recycle capital into higher quality homes, buying 270 homes for an estimated $77 million and selling 128 homes for $25 million. Our average acquisition basis, including purchase price, closing costs and estimated renovation spend, was $286,000, higher than our average disposition price of $198,000. I'll now walk through our third quarter 2017 financial results. Core FFO increased 20.3% year-over-year to $75.4 million or $0.24 per share in the third quarter. The year-over-year increase in core FFO was primarily due to an increase in NOI. Lower cash interest expense also contributed to the increase. The increase in core FFO as well as a decline in recurring CapEx drove a 28.3% year-over-year increase in AFFO to $62 million or $0.20 per share. Supplemental Schedule 1 provides a reconciliation from GAAP net loss to our reported FFO, core FFO and AFFO, including detail on each adjustment we make for nonrecurring items. This quarter, there are two of these nonrecurring items in particular I would like to call out to your attention. The first is merger and transaction-related costs. This is a new line of appearing on our core FFO reconciliation, and we will be recording any one-time costs related to the proposed merger and integration of Starwood Waypoint Homes on this line going forward with the exception of severance expense, which will continue to be reported separately on the severance expense line. In the third quarter, merger and transaction-related costs totaled $4.9 million. This $4.9 million was recorded on our GAAP financial statements in general and administrative expense. The second is casualty loss, which is a component of impairment and other on our GAAP financial statements. Included in the $14.1 million of third quarter net casualty losses in our core FFO reconciliation was a $16 million accrual for damages related to Hurricane Irma. This accrual does not take into account any potential insurance recoveries we may receive that we expect recoveries to be minimal given that most of our impacted homes did not incur enough damage to exceed deductibles. Estimated damages resulting from Irma were recorded as a liability on our balance sheet and to the extent that actual damages ultimately differ from our estimate where we receive insurance proceeds against the damages, we will record these differences on the impairment and other line of our GAAP income statement. These differences would also be backed out of core FFO and appear on the casualty loss line of our core FFO reconciliation. To be clear, NOI will not be directly impacted by the expenses necessary to repair damage related to Hurricane Irma or the associated insurance recoveries. I'll now turn to an update on our balance sheet and capital markets activity. We remain committed to continuing on a path towards an investment-grade balance sheet. Capital markets remain wide open, and we were able to take advantage of that subsequent to quarter end by pricing the industry's first 7-year securitization loan at the best pricing we achieved in our company's history. The total principal amount of the loan is $865 million, of which we will retain 5% to comply with risk retention requirements. And total cost of funds is LIBOR plus 144 basis points. The transaction is expected to close in November. We intend to use the net proceeds to repay IH 2014-2 and IH 2014-3 to fund certain reserves and for general corporate purposes. This securitization transaction and associated debt repayments are expected to result in $4.8 million of net annual interest expense savings and return over $900 million of assets to the unencumbered pool, making 50% of our assets unencumbered. Pro forma weighted average maturity on our debt at the end of the third quarter was 5.1 years with no maturities due before March 2020. Loan-to-value is approximately 40%, and 82% of our debt is fixed or swapped to fixed rate. We also have a $1 billion revolver, which was undrawn at quarter end, and $134 million of unrestricted cash. The last thing I will cover is guidance for the full year 2017. Because our merger with Starwood Waypoint Homes has not yet closed, all guidance provided on today's call is for Invitation Homes as a stand-alone company and does not contemplate any impact from the merger. As John discussed, we continue to have strong fundamental tailwinds at our back and same-store NOI growth in the first three quarters of 2017 was in line with our expectation. As such, we are tightening our full year 2017 guidance range for same-store NOI growth to 6.8% to 7.2%, driven by 4.7% to 4.9% same-store revenue growth and 1.4% to 1.6% same-store expense growth. The majority of the 20 basis point decrease to the midpoint of our same-store revenue growth guidance is attributable to Hurricane Irma's interruption of leasing activity in Florida. In addition, the decline in our same-store revenue expectation is offset by lower expected same-store expenses as a result of better cost controls on controllable expenses as well as lower insurance premiums. Full year 2017 core FFO is expected to be $0.98 to $1.02 per share and AFFO is expected to be $0.82 to $0.86 per share.  One more quick housekeeping announcement before I turn the call back over to John and then to Q&A. We will need to keep this call focused on Invitation Homes' earning results and outlook as a stand-alone company. We will not be able to provide further related to the proposed merger with Starwood Waypoint Homes and we'd refer you to Invitation Homes' merger proxy filed with the SEC for information related to that matter.  Now I'll turn the call over to John. John?
John Bartling: Thanks, Ernie. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I would like to take a quick moment to say thank you to all of our stakeholders. Together with our Starwood Waypoint Homes colleagues, we're providing a compelling option to lease a home for hundreds of thousands of residents, who want to live in their neighborhood of choice, close to where they work and with their families to go to school. And we're continually tailoring our property management operations, as witnessed by the merger of these two great companies, to provide enhanced services and a worry-free living experience to our residents. As we continue to invest in our high-quality homes, we are meaningfully helping to lift neighborhoods and support local trades in our markets from realtors to roofers. In a dynamic housing market like this one, the power of our business model and strong residential markets really shines through. Suffice it to say, what a blast it has been to be a part of building this great company over the past three years. Invitation Homes was built with amazing sponsor, Board of Directors, team of associates and supporting vendor partners. In 2017 alone, we had an unprecedented IPO; successfully executed the industry's first financing with Fannie Mae; negotiated a transformational merger with our peer, Starwood Waypoint Homes; sustained the hurricane and even last week, successfully executed on our eighth securitization for almost $1 billion. All the while, executing day by day on our business plan to provide a great leasing lifestyle for our residents. It is important to note that through all of these multiple transactions or natural disasters, the power of the platform shined. As once again, we showed best-in-class performance with 8.1% same-store NOI growth. I couldn't be more encouraged for our associates and the Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint Homes shareholders' future with a wide range of growth option from the competitive advantage of scale to the compelling prospects of new product offerings. This team has the best people, all of whom have a deep understanding of investing in superior locations, what customer needs and the services that are required. With that, operator, would you please open up the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from David Corak [B. Riley].
David Corak: I just want to start on the expense side. Property taxes came in relatively low this quarter, even lower than the first half of the year. Can you just give some color on what's driving that? And then maybe any initial expectations on a decent run rate for that in terms of growth going forward?
Ernie Freedman: Sure, David. This is Ernie. Property taxes came in about where we expected. And of course, we baked into our expectations transactions that occurred during the year. Hard to really project much around what will happen going forward, so I don't want to get ahead of myself. We'll have a better sense for that here in the coming weeks as a lot of the tax bills from jurisdictions come through here in November and into early December. But things continue to track pretty well there. We do expect long, for at least the near-term, David, that taxes will grow greater than inflation because importantly, home prices are growing at great inflation rates. We're seeing the home prices on our markets going up on average about 6.5%, which is about 100 basis points greater than the national average. That will trickle down to us through assessments, but not the outsize from where we had expected based on that home price appreciation.
David Corak: Okay. That's helpful. And then would you be able to share with us kind of the spot occupancy and rates through end of October or as of today?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. So for the month of October, average occupancy, we mentioned in the call script, our spot occupancy at the end October was 95.8%. So very similar to where we ended September. And occupancy does build up typically throughput the month, and we saw that. And that puts us ahead of where we were last year, David, for October as well.
David Corak: Okay. And then one last quick one for Dallas maybe. You guys were net acquirers this quarter, both in terms of number of homes and dollar amount. Can you just give us a sense as to kind of the channels that you're buying out of and any portfolios in there? And maybe just an update on deal flow and what you're seeing out there?
Dallas Tanner: Yes. The market continues to be relatively tight. We're still – because we're local and we have a high-touch influence in our markets, we're able to see everything that kind of comes through a variety of different channels. As you're well aware of, we are working with particular groups, such as Zillow and Opendoor to identify outside opportunities that may be not transacting through normal channels. But I would say that our focus continues to be in the markets that are higher barrier-to-entry, where we're going to see some of the greatest economic rent growth. So markets like Seattle. And a market that we continue to be bullish on, we – as was pointed out in the call, love our West Coast concentration bias and so we'll continue to try to find opportunities. It helps being local and having an ability to maintain relationships with local sellers.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Neil Malkin of RBC Capital.
Neil Malkin: Appreciate the strength in the West Coast. And this may be too soon to maybe get a read on, but do you guys have any sense for, if there's a larger or an increasing incident of people moving out, particularly in California for job relocation? And I guess, the reason I asked is it just seems like there's more and more things being put in place in California that make it harder to operate a business. So I just wonder if you're starting people maybe relocate to like Denver, Phoenix, something like that. Or is that not really happening?
Bruce Lavine: Neil, this is Bruce. No, we're not seeing that happen in California. We've not seen a slowdown or we've not seen higher numbers of people who are relocating as a reason to move.
Neil Malkin: Okay. And then other one for me would be the weakness that we saw in 3Q just in terms of new leasing, that will be basically attributable to the – to Irma, would you say? Is that where you got probably hit the most?
Ernie Freedman: So two parts to that. I would say, overall, we saw very strength in the West Coast. And as you get into 3Q, especially as you get into September, that's just we're coming out of peak leasing season. So we anticipated that our numbers would be where they were. With that said, I'll let Bruce talk about it. We certainly do have some impact from Irma. And certainly, those markets that it was weaker still than we would have anticipated because of the disruption from the hurricane.
Bruce Lavine: Yes. I think, to add to that, Neil, we did see disruption in Irma from new lease perspective. I'll tell you, though, you probably recall that we were a little late in taking our foot off of the gas on rate growth last year, and it was to our detriment with regard to inventory. And so we were very, very conscious of wanting to respond and correct any opportunities that we had, any imbalances that we had with regard to our occupancy and lease rate. And the third factor, seasonality, continues to be – to play here as well. So those three combined did have an influence.
Neil Malkin: And just if I could follow up on that. Would you expect a bounce back maybe in Florida in the fourth quarter just given the either, A, not – lack of ability to potentially move into a home? And then B, maybe displaced residents from other areas that you guys weren't impacted by who are looking to seek residence while their homes are getting rebuilt?
Bruce Lavine: So Neil, we're not seeing displaced residents. That did not factor – has not factored in for us yet. And as you heard in other reports, the damage was not as substantial to the degree that there were numerous homes that were not habitable any longer. We are seeing pent-up demand in the Florida markets. We made up basically half of our absorption loss in the month of September and October. And leasing numbers are quite strong. So I'm optimistic that there will be opportunities as the leasing continues to see new lease rate growth increase.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani of KBW.
Jade Rahmani: In terms of acquisitions, where are you targeting cap rate on an economic basis after CapEx?
Dallas Tanner: We're still seeing – much like we laid out at our merger call, we're still seeing blended opportunity to be buying on an NOI cap rate basis around a 5.5% cap depending on kind of the market mix. And obviously, you have a little bit of a difference between maybe what you'd see in markets like Northern California or Southern California relative to what you might see in some of the better neighborhoods of Atlanta. But on a blended basis, we still feel, call it, post-CapEx basis, we can still be in the mid 5s.
Jade Rahmani: So that's after CapEx?
Dallas Tanner: Correct.
Jade Rahmani: Okay. Are there interesting markets where there's an opportunity outside of that range like in the 6s that you haven't been in previously?
Dallas Tanner: Well, I think as you think about our portfolio, and we've been pretty consistent with how we've been building it, we want to fit in to those high barrier-to-entry markets. I think it's an important thing to point out with some of the operating statistics that Bruce and his team have put on the board. When you're in those high-demand areas, you have a better opportunity to see revenue growth. And so we'll continue to try to be in those high-demand areas within these MSAs, where we're currently invested. But we do look at other areas for opportunity, but we want to be where the jobs are and where the schools offer a quality of choice and, quite frankly, where people want to live. And those tend to be in those West Coast and Florida markets, where a large percentage of our portfolio is today.
Jade Rahmani: Just on the leasing trends. I was wondering if you could comment on percentage move-outs to buy-in, how that's been trading as we're seeing a push from home builders to grow their entry-level product.
Ernie Freedman: Sure. Jade, we've seen the move-out – the reason for move-out to buy a house had been very consistent for us over the last four or five quarters. It's range between 27% and 30% depending on the quarter. This past quarter, it was 28%. So we're not seeing any meaningful change in patterns there relative to our recent history.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski of Green Street.
John Pawlowski: I was hoping you could just give a little color on how you'd characterize market level pricing power today versus a year ago. Blended rent growth decelerating from 6.1% to 4.3%. I guess, other than maybe a tough comp and some weakness in Florida, what specific factors are causing you to not achieve 6.1% like you did a year ago?
Ernie Freedman: So let me start with that and I'll turn it over to Bruce, John. I think, first and foremost, is the period of time that you're looking at the numbers in 2016, we're comparing to a 2015 period. And the company was in a different stage of its maturation process at that point, really pushing out revenue management ideas, getting better at those as well as catching up for a company that have only been around for a few years and getting stabilized occupancy and really being able to push at that point. You think you're seeing this year is a similar market dynamic. But you're seeing a more mature company as it's going after the renting profile. And so for us, similar characteristics, similar market. We had some catch-up from the prior years. So certainly, more difficult comps. Of course, in the third quarter, you did have three or four markets that were impacted importantly by a natural disaster and some challenges there. Bruce, anything you want to add?
Bruce Lavine: I think my earlier comment about the fact that we suffered slightly on the occupancy point because we were a tad too aggressive in that area applies this year as well. In some of the West Coast markets, the slight sequential differences almost feel like euphoria turning to bliss. You're not looking at 96 7s, but you're still very, very strong all of those markets and demand continues to be strong.
John Bartling: And I would say on the revenue management side, John, this is Bartling, one of the things we went out on the road and said is that it was important to get our lease expiration management in place. And I think what we've done has worked very well to put demand and supply against each other going forward. So I think even next year, as you look at pricing power, we're well positioned for the portfolio as we continue to manage our expirations against demand.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Very helpful. And I appreciate the comments on move out to buy being very much restrained. I guess, what – within that broad portfolio average, what markets are you seeing the most strain on affordability either manifesting itself through move-out to rent increases or moving out to buy activity?
Bruce Lavine: This is Bruce. So we're seeing – the stronger home purchase markets right now would be Tampa. Surprisingly, in the last few months, Minnesota has seen a bit of a spike. Jacksonville continues to be one that does have a higher number of purchases, home purchases.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Buck Horne of Raymond James.
Buck Horne: The question was on the core G&A run rate, if I could. Just – even stripping out the merger and severance cost and the one-time stock comp in that number, it seems to be trending a little bit higher. Is there something pushing that up near term and kind of what's your outlook kind of on a run rate basis for the G&A and also the property management?
Ernie Freedman: Sure. Buck, it's Ernie. And you are right to point out that third quarter for us in G&A was a higher number than you saw in the first two quarters. In the first two quarters, we ran about $10.5 million to $11 million. It jumped up to a little over $13 million when you factor out the noise from some of the one-time type things. We actually had some timing issues in the third quarter that will reverse a little bit in the fourth quarter. One in particular was separate from the hurricane, we did actually pierce our self-insurance retention layer during the third quarter, which were quite a thing to accelerate, recognizing that in the third quarter, where would – so we had to recognize $1.7 million in the third quarter. That will start to reverse out in the fourth quarter from a timing perspective. So if you take out that $1.7 million, you get back to the kind of that run rate for us of $11-ish million, $11.5 million per quarter. So that's really what happened with G&A. And property management continues to kind of track as we would expect it to throughout the year with some minor timing issues then and there. So you should see a drop-off in the fourth quarter because of that one-time timing issue.
Buck Horne: All right. That's perfect. And a quick question, did you – and any of the acquisitions delivered or anything you got in the acquisition pipeline now? Are you taking any delivery of built-for-rent homes yet?
Ernie Freedman: I'll let Dallas talk about that.
Dallas Tanner: Thanks. No. Today, as of today, we have not done any built-to-rent product in our portfolio.
Buck Horne: Okay. And no plans to as of yet?
Dallas Tanner: Not necessarily. I mean, we've looked around and we stay open-minded. I think it's really focused on where those opportunities present themselves. And in some of the markets we are in currently, we don't see a ton of those built-to-rent opportunities.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Doug Harter of Crédit Suisse.
Doug Harter: Ernie, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the financing markets, kind of where terms are today and whether there's any update on being – the ability to do more GSE financing?
Ernie Freedman: Sure. And the markets are wide open. You saw one of our peer company have a very successful transaction in September and we were able to have a very successful transaction. We'll close sometime this month. And the securitization market spreads continue to be more favorable. And actually, we're seeing secondary trading on our securitization will close soon. Trading had been slightly tighter from where we priced. So the security, there's a dearth of product, which helps borrowers like us from a capital markets perspective. The GSE markets, to be seen. We certainly got a great deal down with Fannie earlier this year. We understand that Freddie folks are giving some consideration to things as well, but can't speak for either of those two groups. That's another avenue that's open for us. Importantly for us, Doug, and we've talked about we have a commitment to wanting to move to an investment grade balance sheet. And so as we've seen that we've had very – a lot of success in the secured market to the securitizations and through the deals with the agencies, we've had a number of banks reach out to us to talk about ideas that would help us – that make that transition over the next period of time to create an even larger unencumbered pool, which today is at 50%; to increase our weighted average maturity, which today is at 5.1 and to open up some new avenues to us as well. So we're fortunate, not just us, the industry and a lot of borrowers are in a very good, healthy position maybe able to access the capital markets, and we'll continue to take advantage of that as we think about it moving forward with our capital markets plans.
Doug Harter: Just on the last point. As you move to more unsecured, is there a near-term cost to do that relative to securitization? Or can you accomplish it with minimal extra cost in the short term?
Ernie Freedman: Well, you really have to factor in a couple of things, Doug. So you have to look at the type of financing but importantly, the term. And so today, we have shorter-term securitization financing, I've seen, that's hedged. So we've hedged our cost for that at an 80% level. And so we haven't made final conclusions on what term we may be looking to do and how we may roll that out. So the answer is there could a cost associated with that, but we'll – that's something we'll study very carefully as we determine how we move forward, how we start making those – that transition and then do it in a smart way to provide flexibility to the organization, but also to provide certainty around our capital stack.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ryan Gilbert of BTIG.
Ryan Gilbert: Was wondering if you could add any color on the specific initiatives that you're undertaking to drive the controllable expense line down.
Ernie Freedman: Sure. I'll take a couple of passes at that. So on the controllable expense line, we break our expenses between fixed and controllable. So on control, we've done a lot of work around repairs and maintenance and turnover in terms of how we procure, having consistent scope across the country. When you have 13 regions, you have a best region and you have a weakest region in terms of how they're doing with their cost. And we learn from the best and try to roll that out across the board and improve those that are struggling a little bit. We've been very focused on the personnel side throughout the year, being smarter on how we deploy resources. Importantly, providing a better customer experience, but we're also finding that we can do that by being more efficient, by centralizing some different activities, and we've had some great success with that. It's been led by our Chief Revenue Officer around our call centers and being more efficient there. But again, much more importantly providing better customer service to those who are calling in. And on leasing and marketing, we're looking at different things as well there in terms of working with the folks who work with us on that side and being smart about how we're deploying. So we continue to have opportunities there as we move forward.
Bruce Lavine: Ernie, if I can add with regard to our maintenance performance, the ProCare Program continues to pay dividends. The fact that we don't just get into homes that request work orders initially. We get into all the homes, is helping us to deter the anomalous turn that could raise our costs. And it's also helping us to serve the residents better by addressing their issues early.
Ryan Gilbert: Okay. Great. And then as you look into the fourth quarter in 2018, what line items are showing the most opportunity to continue to drive expenses down or that continue to control expenses on those lines?
Ernie Freedman: Yes. I want to be careful about getting too far ahead on 2018. So I would say all are available for us to continue to get smarter at. And as an organization, we've been doing this now for a little more than five years. So I think some have more opportunities than others. It'll probably appropriate for me to share details on that the next time we get together on an earnings call.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill: When we look at the – just carrying on the cost side, when we look at the cost to maintain, if I'm looking at this right, the cost per turn actually went up year-over-year, but the overall cost to maintain went down because turnover was down. Just wanted to see if that backs out the hurricane cost. And if not, how you would sort of describe the increase on a year-over-year basis.
Ernie Freedman: Yes. Sure. So it does back out the hurricane costs. So the costs associated with the hurricane are not are included in our repairs and maintenance numbers or our turnover numbers. So a couple of things. You pointed out correctly that our total cost to maintain has come down slightly and you've seen turnovers come down slightly as well. And turnover is up a few percentage points year-over-year. Hard to draw a lot of specific trends from that, Dennis, from first quarter. But the team continues to be very smart and very careful about how they're looking where to spend. We are choosing on turnover today to try to put some more long-dated items in the houses if we didn't do that initially. I know there's been some discussion on other calls about putting in the hard surfaces, for instance, for flooring. That's something we've been doing for a long time, but we continue to roll out in the turns. And so we are comfortable with investing. And you've seen our numbers, our CapEx numbers are up significantly more year-over-year and turnover relative to what's happening with the expense piece. Part of that is investing for the future and being a little bit smarter. So we think long term, that will bring down R&M costs as well as future turnover costs. So a little bit of investment, a little bit – it's kind of where it's been before and trying to be smarter about how we're doing each of our turns.
Dennis McGill: Okay. On the new lease side, Bruce, you were talking about having to balance occupancy this year a little bit differently than maybe last year. Could you give us any stats on where new lease rent growth was in October this year versus last year?
Bruce Lavine: Sure. New lease rent growth in October came in at 1.9%.
Dennis McGill: And what was that last October?
Bruce Lavine: I do not have last October's, but we can get that for you. Bear with me for one second. It was the high twos last year.
Dennis McGill: Okay. And then last question would just be on Chicago. Would that be in a market that's underperforming both from margin and growth? Dallas, is there an opportunity to close that gap organically? Or do you have to start thinking about changing the structure of the portfolio and what you own there?
Dallas Tanner: Well, Bruce and his team have done a terrific job on the occupancy side of things. They continue to find ways to increase our efficiencies there from a management standpoint. In terms of – from an asset management perspective, look, we're going to consistently cull and rank our portfolio and look for ways to recycle capital. We laid that out at our IPO earlier this year, and we've held largely in line with that strategy throughout, call it, October of this year. We will look to find ways to make our portfolio better. That could include some culling and some selling. It could also mean that we will add properties into certain markets where we're seeing additional strengths. So I think it would be normal to say that we would look at all options to keep making our portfolio better and enhance overall shareholder return.
John Bartling: Dennis, this is John. One thing on new rent growth. I do want to point out. In October, where – it's one of our largest lease expiration months. And we were very purposeful to get our lease expirations off of October. So I wouldn't read too much into it. We move something like 600 leases off of this month for next year. So it's – we looked at October as an opportunity to sort of streamline that and make that a better month for next year.
Dennis McGill: And sorry, so you had more expiring this October than last October or vice versa?
John Bartling: We had more expiring last year than this year. Still this year, we had more. Next year, we won't. I'm sorry.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to John Bartling for any closing remarks.
John Bartling: Thank you, operator. Thank you, again, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest, and the team looks forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT next week. And on a personal note, one more heartfelt thank you from me as I sign off. I'll be forever grateful for the experiences I've had and the relationships I've formed as CEO of Invitation Homes, and I thank you all for the trust you've extended to us along the way. Operator, this concludes our call.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Invitation Homes First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen only mode at this time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Greg Van Winkle, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Van Winkle: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. On today's call from Invitation Homes are John Bartling, Chief Executive Officer; Ernie Freedman, Chief Financial Officer; Dallas Tanner, Chief Investment Officer; and Bruce Lavine, Chief Operations Officer. I'd like to point everyone to our first quarter 2017 Earnings Press Release & Supplemental Information which we may reference on this call. This document can be found on the Investor Relations section of our Web-site at ir.invitationhomes.com. Finally, I'd like to inform you that certain statements made during this call may include forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of our business, financial results, liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in any such statements.

Invitation Homes does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so. During this call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with the most comparable GAAP measures, in our Earnings Release & Supplemental Information, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our Web-site. I'll now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, John Bartling.
John B. Bartling Jr.: Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone. We are off to a terrific start for 2017. Core FFO and AFFO for our first quarter as a public company were above our expectations. As we continue to push pricing, occupancy remained high, near 96% for the same-store portfolio, and turnover remained in the low 30s, reflecting the quality of our investment strategies and customer service. As a result, we achieved total portfolio NOI growth of 7.9% and same-store NOI growth of 5.7%. We have industry-leading scale with 48,000 homes in 13 markets, with over 70% of our revenue concentrated in high growth Western U.S. and Florida markets. Our investment strategy is simple; we invest in supply-constrained infill locations near major employment centers with good schools and desirable amenities where families can thrive. Our differentiated operating platform is driven in the market. We employ over 700 local experts in the field who buy, sell, renovate, manage our homes and serve our residents with care, as exemplified by our A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. Given that many of our competitors are mom and pops, this commitment to 24/7 service truly differentiates our value proposition, leading to higher revenue, lower turnover and efficient maintenance of our homes, through our industry-leading ProCare program. To drive incremental margin expansion, we are focused on the following key initiatives for 2017. First, we are working actively towards shifting more of our lease expirations into the higher-demand spring and summer months. We believe that this will benefit our pricing power and lower our days to re-resident on turns. On the cost side, we centralized and outsourced our call center in the first quarter, creating a more consistent customer service experience at a lower cost. We expect operating efficiencies to benefit from our implementation of an interactive voice response system, which should reduce unqualified call volumes. We have also automated charges to residents, driving meaningful ancillary income growth to the consistent collection of fees. You'll see this in the 22% other income growth we enjoyed in the first quarter. The tailwinds also remain at our back with respect to supply and demand fundamentals in our 13 well-selected markets, where supply is muted and job growth is above the national average. This is evidenced by our industry-leading rent growth, especially in the Western U.S. where we saw same-store blended rent growth of almost 7% in Q1. Home price appreciation, also known as HPA, continues to climb nationally. HPA in Invitation Homes' markets was up 6.5% year-over-year, 80 bps higher than the national average, led by strong appreciation in the Western U.S. and Florida markets. Lastly, the first quarter of 2017 was a period of tremendous success for our associates. I would like to thank each of them for delivering a great living experience to 50,000 families, innovating and executing operationally and making our IPO possible. I'm proud not only of the financial results our team has produced, but also the positive impact our associates make every day to the communities we invest in, the residents we serve, and the vendors we work with, and the investors who trust us with their capital. In conclusion, we entered the second quarter with strong 96% occupancy in April. That put us on track to achieve the 6.5% to 7.5% same-store NOI growth that we are guiding you today for 2017. Looking ahead further, the favorable demographic and macro tailwinds in our differentiated markets should provide Invitation Homes with a long runway for internal growth and margin expansion. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ernie Freedman, our Chief Financial Officer. Ernie?
Ernest M. Freedman: Thank you, John. Today I will cover the following topics; operating results for the first quarter and April; portfolio activity for the first quarter; capital markets activity specific to our IPO and related financing activity, including our recently closed Fannie Mae loan; financial results for the first quarter; balance sheet; and 2017 guidance. The first quarter of 2017 was a strong start to the year for us operationally, as we executed well in driving rent growth, growing other income and beating internal expectations around expense growth. Total portfolio NOI grew 7.9% year-over-year. We experienced this NOI growth despite a slight decrease in average home count. For our same-store portfolio of 43,224 homes, NOI grew 5.7%. Same-store revenue growth of 4.7% was driven by average rental rate growth of 4.5% and other income growth of 22.3%, partially offset by a decline in occupancy to 95.8%. Ancillary income items rolled out during 2016 continue to earn in as they are implemented in all renewal and new leases. And we believe we have more opportunities to come with regards to other income. While our total same-store expenses grew 3%, controllable cost, as noted on our Supplemental Schedule 3(b), grew only 0.4%. Real estate taxes were the largest driver of total same-store expense growth, increasing 7.1%. Personnel expenses were 15.9% lower year-over-year, and leasing and marketing expenses were 17.3% lower year-over-year, and we continue to see opportunities to lower these expenses going forward. We also saw a 10.7% decline in insurance expense. Net effective rental rate growth remained strong during the quarter. First and fourth quarter rent growth is typically lower due to seasonality. Same-store blended rent growth for the first quarter of 2017 increased 4.5% year-over-year, with renewal growth for the quarter at 5.3%. New lease growth improved each month from January through March. Northern California, Seattle and Phoenix were our strongest growing markets with same-store blended rent growth between 6.5% and 8%. April same-store results continued our sequential monthly positive trends. April average occupancy was 96.0% with blended rent growth of 5.1%. Renewal increases remained healthy at 5.5% while new lease increases were 4.4%. Annualized turnover was 34.3%. I'll now move on to our portfolio activity. In the first quarter of 2017, the total number of homes in our portfolio declined by 380 to 47,918 homes. Inventory of homes available for purchase in our markets remains tight, but we are still finding attractive investment opportunities by leveraging our local relationships. In the first quarter, we acquired 121 homes for an estimated $31 million, which includes purchase price, closing costs and anticipated renovation expenditure. The average nominal stabilized cap rate on acquisitions during the quarter was 5.5%. Our three most active acquisition markets by invested basis were South Florida, Southern California and Orlando. We sold 501 homes during the quarter for gross proceeds of $78 million, at an average nominal cap rate of 3.4%, based on trailing 12 months NOI. For the year, we expect acquisition and disposition activity to mostly offset, keeping our total home count at approximately 48,000 homes. Next, I'll walk through our initial public offering and related refinancing activity. On February 6, 2017, we closed an initial public offering of 88.55 million shares of common stock at a price of $20 per share. This resulted in net proceeds of $1.7 billion. Alongside our IPO, we also entered into a fully funded $1.5 billion term loan facility with a five-year term and an unfunded $1 billion revolving credit facility. With proceeds from our initial public offering and term loan, we repaid $3.1 billion of debt in February. In March, we prepaid additional debt, bringing total debt repayments to $3.3 billion. I'd also like to provide some details on our previously announced Fannie Mae securitization that we closed in April. I'd like to take a moment to thank the teams from both Fannie Mae and Wells Fargo for their tireless efforts over the last many months. We value their partnership and are committed to making it a success. The principal amount of our loan is $1 billion, of which we have retained $55.5 million. And the fixed interest rate on the debt is 4.23%. We used the net proceeds from the transaction to repay the remainder of our 2014-1 securitization and a portion of our 2014-3 securitization. Importantly, the Fannie Mae loan includes provisions that allow for more flexibility than our previous securitizations. We have broader substitution rights for the collateral and also have the opportunity to reduce the number of homes in the collateral pool if cash flows and asset values increase over time. I will discuss additional balance sheet information later in my remarks, but first I would like to walk through our first quarter 2017 financial results. Supplemental Schedule 1 provides a reconciliation from GAAP net loss to our reported Core FFO and AFFO. To calculate Core FFO and AFFO per share, we have assumed that the weighted average shares outstanding for the two months we were public were actually outstanding for the entire quarter. That is, we divided our full operating results by approximately 312 million shares. Core FFO per share was $0.25. Core FFO in the quarter totaled $78.2 million, up 21.6% from $64.3 million in the first quarter of 2016. In line with NAREIT's definition for FFO, we add back depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and impairment on depreciated real estate assets and deduct gains on sale, in order to reconcile from net loss to FFO. There are some additional adjustments that were made to arrive at Core FFO from FFO. These include; $15.1 million of non-cash interest expense, consisting of items such as amortization of deferred financing costs, write-off of deferred financing costs from early paydowns of credit facilities; mortgage loan discounts and the mark to market on our derivates prior to eligibility for hedge accounting on February 1st; $7.6 million of operating related expenses related to our initial public offering; and $44.2 million of share-based incentive compensation expense. All share-based incentive compensation expense recognized during the quarter was the result of pre-IPO incentive compensation programs that apply to our time as a private company, or one-time awards payable as a direct result of our IPO. As you can see in Supplemental Schedule 6, adjusting for these one-time items in G&A and property management expense, G&A is $10.3 million, down 1.8% year-over-year, and property management expense is $7.5 million, up 3.3% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in Core FFO was primarily due to an increase in NOI, even despite a slight decline in home count. Lower cash interest expense also contributed to the increase in Core FFO. The increase in Core FFO as well as a decline in recurring CapEx drove a 30.4% year-over-year increase in AFFO to $69 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, or $0.22 per share. I'll now turn to an update on our balance sheet. Following our previously discussed IPO and related refinancings and pro forma for our Fannie Mae securitization related debt repayments, the weighted average maturity on our debt at the end of the first quarter was 4.7 years with no maturities due before September 2019. Loan to value was 44%, based on total enterprise value implied by our stock price at the end of the quarter, and 78% of our debt was fixed or swapped to fixed-rate. We have a $1 billion revolver, which has been undrawn since its closing, and $192 million of unrestricted cash. In addition, 41% of our assets are unencumbered. Going forward, we are committed to improving our portfolio through capital recycling and deleveraging our balance sheet with cash flow remaining after our dividend payout, continuing on a path towards an investment-grade balance sheet. The last thing I will cover is our guidance for the full year 2017. As John discussed, we are pleased with our start in 2017, we continue to have strong fundamental tailwinds at our back, and we have the opportunity to augment growth through a number of strategic initiatives. As such, we expect same-store NOI growth of 6.5% to 7.5% for the full year 2017, driven by 4.75% to 5.25% same-store revenue growth and 1.5% to 2% same-store expense growth. Core FFO is expected to be $0.96 to $1.04 per share and AFFO is expected to be $0.80 to $0.88 per share. Now I'll turn it over to John. John?
John B. Bartling Jr.: Thanks Ernie. In summary, we feel good about the start of this year. With the IPO behind us, we couldn't be more enthusiastic about the opportunity in front of us and the macro trends that support our industry, from the demand drivers of population and employment growth to the tempered supply of new housing and a tight labor market. We continue to see interesting investing opportunities, from value-added reinvestment in our own portfolio to regular way market transactions. We are disciplined investors and professional managers. We've built a platform that is uniquely positioned to drive shareholder value for the long haul. As witnessed in our performance this quarter, our homes provide a differentiated product near where our customers work, where they desire to live, with the services they demand, and the homes for which their families can thrive. I'd like to thank everybody for your time today and continued interest in Invitation Homes. Operator, with that, I'll let you please open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from David Corak of FBR. Please go ahead.
David Corak: Looking at your acquisitions in the quarter, it looks like you've stayed pretty true to the strategy you guys laid out during the IPO, and Ernie, your comments reflected that in your prepared remarks, but now that we are three or four months into your life as a public company and things are certainly going as planned, is there an environment where it makes sense to really step on the pedal in terms of external growth?
Dallas B. Tanner: This is Dallas. Our strategy will remain consistent, as you laid out, that we plan on being net neutral for the year. And with that said, we are very active in our markets with over 20 investment professionals that are in market. So we certainly see everything and we are constantly developing acquisition channels and looking for ways that we can continue to maintain an edge in our buying. We are aware of some of the opportunities that are out there, we take a look at everything, and I would expect that we'll stay true to our plan but wouldn't count us out on being strategic if something made sense.
David Corak: Okay. And then on the flip side, some of the markets that you are reducing exposure to, Dallas, maybe you can give us a little color on those particular markets and the assets you're selling there, are there particular submarkets that are dictating the sales or is it more property specific kind of stuff? It's kind of interesting because some of your competitors are actually buying in some of those markets, particularly in Phoenix. So any color, market color on that would be helpful.
Dallas B. Tanner: Absolutely. Expect us to be consistent capital recyclers in all of our markets. You mentioned Phoenix specifically. We did have a transaction that occurred in the first quarter. If you think about that transaction, we sold roughly 235 homes to a private buyer, a new entrant in the marketplace. And the rents on those homes were suboptimal relative to where our current pricing in that market is with the assets that we are buying. We sold the homes on average that were in the $900 to $950 per month rent band. And if you look at how we are reinvesting capital in that market, we are buying much closer to $1,200 in terms of our monthly rents. I would expect that we would have that same strategy going forward in most of our markets, where you will look at us calling some of the bottom or the suboptimal performers and reinvesting that capital in parts of the submarket that we are more interested in at this time.
David Corak: Fair enough. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: A question for Ernie, if you could just comment on your expectations for a couple of the line items, G&A, property management, and occupancy guidance, and maybe CapEx as well?
Ernest M. Freedman: Sure, Juan. We provided very specific guidance items within our release. I can give you directionally some thoughts on each of those. With regards to the occupancy, we feel that we are in a pretty good spot and would expect for the year to be somewhere in the high 95% to about 96% for our same-store portfolio, somewhat similar to where we were last year to maybe down 10 basis points or so from where we were last year. For capital expenditures, the expectation would be that we'd be approximately $1,000 per home, plus or minus, which has been consistent with where we've run for the last period of time. For property management and for G&A expenses, we ran a little bit favorable in the first quarter. So I would expect that we'll have a slight increase in future quarters around that, but not a big change from where you saw those numbers, but do expect slightly higher numbers.
Juan Sanabria: Okay, great. And then in terms of guidance, it seems like there is an acceleration into the second half or into the peak leasing. Is that kind of what you guys are assuming and any comments on kind of the start of May? I know it's still early, but any color on how rents are trending past April?
Ernest M. Freedman: I want to be cautious about providing information past April. What I can tell you is, renewal increases for May, June and July went out in the 7% range. Certainly some markets a little bit higher, some a little bit lower, and typically we do see on renewals that we have a degradation of about 150 or so basis points from our ask as we have that negotiation. As you know, renewals tend to be a lot less volatile and more stable, and renewals are two-thirds of our business. So, even though we're only halfway through May, that should give you a sense for where we may be coming out, but I don't want to give too much more detail around May results. And Juan, just remind me, what was the other part of the question? I want to make sure I address that.
Juan Sanabria: No, you hit on it. That's perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Paolone of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Anthony Paolone: Just following up on the last one, can you talk about how revenue management is coming along and how that is playing into your approach on occupancy and pushing rents?
Ernest M. Freedman: Absolutely, Tony. We're excited with the progress we have made on revenue management, but at the same time revenue management isn't new for us, it's something we've been very focused on and had some pretty good systems in place over the last many years. What we are really trying to do is automate more and have better access to better data through some proprietary partnerships that we have with third parties. And that's allowing our folks in the field to more efficiently and more quickly pull comparable information, work with our folks in our national office to make sure we're strategically where we want to be with price, and importantly, getting out there with an aggressive price, but also understanding that as inventory does age, and it does for us from time to time, that we make the appropriate price adjustments. I think the other important thing about revenue management that we have talked about with folks in the past is the work we are trying to do around our lease expiration schedule. And we actually had some modest success in that even in this early part in the year. Previously, going into this year, our lease expiration schedule was spread out pretty evenly across our four quarters, almost 25% each quarter. We actually now going forward have about a 21% exposure in the fourth quarter, which we are pleased to see that we are moving in that direction. This will be, Tony, probably a two to three year initiative at least to continue to try to roll out at least into the appropriate periods for expiration, but we're pleased with our initial movements on it. We set out targets for each of our markets as to what we want to try to get done. Some markets are more seasonal than others, and so we are taking that into consideration. And so, we are hopeful to be able to continue to talk about modest improvements each time we meet with you on a quarterly basis.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. And then if I look at your other income, was up a lot. Was that all sort of chargebacks or are you all doing the utility – putting utilities on your names or changing over to that sort of a system? Just trying to understand kind of like what drove that top line so much.
Ernest M. Freedman: Sure. The other income number is actually all internal and not having to do with chargebacks. You'll see in our resident recovery number that it does look like we have additional chargebacks going through, but we actually had similar amounts year-over-year. It was more a classification issue in how we were looking at the last year numbers. So the increases you're seeing in other income, Tony, are coming from steps that we took in 2016 to rollout consistent fees and the application of those fees in our national standardized leased. It took all through 2016 into early 2017 for that to get into all of our leases as we turn leases. And so, things like pet rent are up 300% year-over-year. Now it's off a small base, it's off a base of less than $0.5 million, but we had over $1.5 million of pet rent in the first quarter for instance. That was a big driver of our increase. We're also more consistently automating many of these fees to make sure they are being charged appropriately, so they are not at the discretion of our local folks but go through the process automatically. That also saw that $0.5 million increase for us year-over-year. So the approximate $2 million increase you see in other income is being driven by our success of consistently charging pet rents and consistently charging our other fees to our residents as outlined in their leases.
Anthony Paolone: And so, do you think that number, that 22% up, is kind of where this year is going to look or can that even accelerate or how should we think about that? Because it seem to have a pretty meaningful contribution, seem to be like 50 to 100 basis points of contribution to top line growth, which kind of offset any diminish in year-over-year occupancy.
Ernest M. Freedman: Sure, and I think what you'll see Tony is that – I wish I could say with what we have in place today, we could continue to grow at 22% each quarter. That's not likely. We'll probably be more in the high teens raise. But importantly, we are kind of at the early stages of what we are trying to get accomplished with other income. And so the initiatives that are in front of us and that we rolled out last year, there will be an earn-in to those and those will slow down, but we expect those to be replaced over time by new initiatives as we look to improve the types of services we can provide to our residents, around bundling services, around things like landscaping, which they are responsible for, but we can certainly work with local landscapers to find the right partner for our residents. So, as those roll in over maybe the second half of 2017, but certainly in the future years, we have the opportunity for significant outsized growth in other income that should outpace rental growth for quite a while. I can't promise you 20% type numbers forever, but I can tell you, we have a long runway to continue to have outsized growth in other income.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. And then you mentioned outsourcing I think the call centers. And so, can you give us a little color on how you thought through that process and any other functions in the organization? Because if we go back a few years when this all started, most of the platforms were outsourcing things, and then over the last few years it seems like that shifted to bringing lots of functions in-house. So it was interesting to hear about you kind of go to an outsourcing on that function.
Ernest M. Freedman: Sure, Tony, I'll provide a little bit of color on that. You pointed an important thing, that what differentiated Invitation Homes from the geckos was everything was done locally by our in-house teams, whether it was our acquisitions, our property management or how we are running our back-office. As we continue to progress as an organization and mature as an organization, first and foremost we want to provide the best level of service to our residents and making sure they are getting a consistent service, a unique service, and if there's the opportunity to do it more cost-efficiently, that's just a win-win for everyone as well. But something like call center, we have outsourced it but it's being managed by Invitation Homes' folks. And so we have Invitation Homes' management embedded with our folks at the outsourced center to make sure it is the high-quality Invitation Homes experience that they are having. So in effect, we did take folks that were working for Invitation Homes. We are now using a partner to help us with our call center. But what I'd say is that, because it's being managed actively by us in their center from our corporate office, it's just a natural maturation of how it can provide better service to our residents and how we can provide a more cost-efficient solution to the organization.
Anthony Paolone: Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Doug Harter of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Doug Harter: Ernie, you talked a little bit about kind of being on the path towards investment-grade. Can you talk about kind of what other steps you think you need to ultimately get there and what the balance sheet needs to look like?
Ernest M. Freedman: Yes, sure. I appreciate you asking that. It's going to be a long path for us based on where we're at today. I think first and foremost, when I'm thinking about the balance sheet, I want to make sure we are liquid, that we are safe, that we are in a good spot and can provide the opportunity for the Company to do what it needs to do. Getting to investment-grade would certainly open up another capital source for us, which is very exciting, but of course we're excited about the more recent capital source that opened up to us with Fannie Mae. That said, with investment-grade certainly there's been a marker that's been placed for the industry based on what one of our peers accomplished, which was a fantastic accomplishment and I'm very excited for them and very excited for the industry that they were able to do that. But we all do have different balance sheet strategies. And so, our balance sheet strategy is a little bit different than that peer. But I would expect that we need to have a net debt-to-EBITDA number that is lower than we are today at 9.9x, probably definitely many turns lower, for us to be there. I think we're in a pretty good spot with our loan to value. We are getting to a better spot with our unencumbered pool. Our unencumbered pool is about 41% of our assets. I think traditionally you would see investment-grade companies at 7x or less. You would see investment-grade companies with unencumbered pools more in the 60% to 80% range. Those things aren't too far off from us. They are not a year away, but they are few years away, and we're on a path to try to get there by using excess cash flow after our dividend payout to continue to delever the Company, like we have done here in the first 90 days or so that we've been a public company.
Doug Harter: Thanks. And then on the completing of the Fannie Mae deal, is that something that you guys would expect what you'd be able to replicate into additional deals? How do you view that process going forward?
Ernest M. Freedman: We'll have to see. This is certainly a pilot program for Fannie Mae and we're very excited that they have done this for the industry. It's not just good for Invitation Homes, it's good for the Invitation more broadly. Of course, there's another agency out there that may have some interest at some point as well. And so, we'll keep all our options open. But I can't speak for them as to what their goals may be with regards to how large a pipeline they will have and how much of this financing they will do on an annual basis, but we'll certainly keep it as a tool in our toolkit. We think it's a great product. We are very excited about it. I think it's very complementary to everything else that we are trying to accomplish. And if there's something that may happen at some point later in the future, we'll keep that as an option for us.
Doug Harter: Great. Thanks Ernie.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Richard Hill: Ernie, it's Richard Hill. Two questions; first of all, I was hoping you could give us maybe a little bit of some views on how we should think about margin trajectory going forward? It looks like you had some nice progress this quarter. But how should we think about that maybe for the rest of the year?
Ernest M. Freedman: Sure. I think on a year-over-year basis, Richard, we have a continued opportunity to improve our margins through the cost-efficiency type initiatives that we're looking at on the expense side as well as continued outsized revenue growth, whether it's from rent or whether it's through our other income. And we feel very good about the opportunity to continue to push margins and improve on those. And even today, we're at margins that are consistent and competitive, and actually in some cases better than multi-family. And I think we have a little bit more of a runway with regards to improvement ideas, as we're all kind of still in our early stages of putting together initiatives that can help improve those further.
Richard Hill: Got it. And so, as you sort of think about getting margin into the high 60s, maybe just over the next several years, what do you think the biggest drivers of that are? You obviously had some really nice expense controls this quarter. Is it going to continue to be there, is it going to be the operating leverage, how should we think about that?
Ernest M. Freedman: You said the number, high 60s. I just want to make sure of that. But I can certainly see a path for us to get there, Richard, but I want to be careful about providing very specific guidance.
Richard Hill: Understood.
Ernest M. Freedman: We certainly see a path to that. And so I think it's all of the above that you said. We've been running this business now for about five years and the first 2.5 to 3 years it was very focused on acquiring homes, renovating them, getting residents in there, and generating positive cash flows, and we were very successful at that. The last couple of years, it's been very focused on how can we operate better. And now we're very focused on building the brand and saying, what can we provide service-wise, from an internal growth perspective, to make our residents experience better when they are living with us. And what's exciting about those opportunities is, not only is it providing better living experience for our residents, they tend to be high-margin type items too. So, it's kind of a double win-win from that perspective. With our platform in the markets that we are in, it's important to understand that margins are influenced by the markets where you are investing, because as you can certainly see in our disclosures and others, not all markets are created equal when it comes to operating margin. And also importantly, not all markets are created equal when it comes to growth opportunities, and we're first and foremost focused on growth opportunities and overall return. That said, if those markets also have better margins, we like that as well. But those first parts are more important. But I think it's a combination of being smarter in how we run our homes, run the business, and continue to be able to push for leading renewal growth as well as fantastic other operating growth, will translate to a number that you said with regards to overall margins for our portfolio.
Richard Hill: Got it. And then on the leverage side, it looks like you – obviously that's been a big focus of yours, it looks like you made some really nice progress in the first quarter. Are you willing to give any guidance for the year and where you expect leverage to be by the end of the year or is that still too premature at this point?
Ernest M. Freedman: I'd say, Richard, it's consistent with what we said earlier this year, that we will improve, we would expect to improve and we believe we'll improve our net debt-to-EBITDA number by about a turn each year, a little bit more than a turn. So we're a quarter of the way through the year. So I certainly would hope we've put us in a position that on annualizing fourth quarter numbers, that we'd be more in the low 9s, where today we're in the high 9s. And we're able to do that by having a lower dividend payout ratio and focusing that extra cash flow on deleveraging. In addition, HPA continues to grow. So we would hope that our LTD stats would also improve from a leverage perspective as well.
Richard Hill: Got it. And I've asked the two questions, but just one more if that's okay. You had mentioned HPA at the beginning, and I very much see the same trends you are seeing, but any updates on move out to home purchase trends or is it sort of consistent with what you've seen in the past?
Ernest M. Freedman: First quarter is always a seasonally slower quarter. So it was actually a lower number than we've seen in the last few quarters. For the last five quarters, that number for us has trended between 23% and 30%, and you see the 30% number in the summer months. This quarter I think it was around 25%, 26%. And so, no, we are not seeing a wild swing for that for a reason that people are moving out.
Richard Hill: Got it. Thanks for your time, guys. I really appreciate it.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Please go ahead.
Jade Rahmani: Can you comment on why rent growth in renewals is tracking above re-leases? Especially in the spring lease-up season, I would expect the reverse to be the case.
Ernest M. Freedman: Jade, spring lease-up season is just starting here, and we've always consistently been strong at pushing renewals, that's our first and foremost focus, and we do that 60 to 90 days out before lease expires. And going back the last 15 to 16 months if you include April, we're consistently in kind of that 5.2%, up to 6% range for renewals. But new lease, we are continuing to see upward trajectory. Our April numbers are stronger than our March numbers, which were stronger than February, which were stronger than January. And so, I don't want to predict what's going to happen in May-June-July, but you are absolutely right that from a seasonal perspective you will sometimes see new lease rates get to where renewals are or slightly higher. So, watch out to how the rest of the year, the spring and summer plays out for us.
Jade Rahmani: Can you comment on April traffic trends and just overall level of demand, level of inquiries on home showings?
Ernest M. Freedman: I don't have that exactly at our hands, Jade. We'll have to – we can certainly follow up with you afterwards and talk about that specifically.
Jade Rahmani: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Ernie, what are the new and renewal assumptions for full year 2017 that underpin the midpoint of rent revenue?
Ernest M. Freedman: No, John, we're not providing that specific level of guidance for folks with regards to what are specific renewal and new lease. What I can tell you is that renewal tends to run in the 5s for us. We've seen that for a long period of time. So you can certainly suppose that that's what we'd be considering. But instead, we are focusing more on, I can give you at a high-level perspective, we expect that occupancy will be about the same as it was in 2016, maybe down 10 to 15 basis points, and we talked about where other income is going to be, certainly in the higher teens range from a growth perspective. And you can then kind of do the math to see what that means for rental growth and where we need to go. And of course as you know, John, more than half of our growth from leases is already baked into our numbers, from the leases we signed last year and what we've signed here in the first quarter and also through April.
John Pawlowski: Okay, great. A question for Bruce, when I'm looking through the markets and the occupancy year-over-year fluctuations, I've seen wide relative to some other property type. So questions are; one, do you think this is status quo for this property type, 200 bps swings or 100 bps swings year-over-year in occupancy; and two, did the 60 bps year-over-year decline surprise you guys at all to the downside?
Bruce A. Lavine: I think that we were very, very pleased with the 2016 number of 96.4%. That was exceptional for us. So the decline relative to that strong performance – and we feel comfortable that 95.8% is still a very strong number. As Ernie mentioned earlier, we do have lease expiration management opportunities and we did have markets where we had more product available at the beginning of the year due to some of the disconnects on a few expiration management markets. So, I do not think it's inherent, it's not a part and parcel of how we would expect the operations to be, and we do anticipate that as we make the progress in realigning our lease expirations, that we'll see less of a decline in some of the markets that you mentioned.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And last one for me, Dallas, I appreciate your comments on the game-plan being net neutral in external growth in 2017. Just curious, what would that hypothetical strategic portfolio look like for you guys to go and take, to go acquire in 2017, what would it have to look like?
Dallas B. Tanner: I'm not going to speculate. I mean, obviously you want to get it for free and it needs to have a lot of rent. But what I will say is, you know that we are bullish on coastal markets that are high barrier to entry, where we can continue to operate with higher gross economic rent. That's been our model. So if a said opportunity were to present itself in markets that you know and we've made really clear we are bullish on, expect us to continue to look strategically at those opportunities. We see things that come across the desk all the time. We haven't seen anything to date that has caused us to make a move, but we are always looking for opportunities to create shareholder value.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Malkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Bruce, one for you, kind of piggybacking up a question asked just recently, can you just talk about the type of demand maybe from a qualitative standpoint that you're seeing early into peak leasing? You guys have a different demographic than the traditional multi-family. I'm wondering if you're seeing any strength in one particular cohort, be it people transferring for work, new families moving to your areas, anything like that would be helpful.
Bruce A. Lavine: Yes, we're finding that – it's interesting that I was reading recently about the movement of millennials out of the home. The cohorts that moved in years ago are moving out now. And so we are seeing demand coming from pent-up demand in that group moving into home-buying. We have not seen any great shift in the demand. It continues to be a part of what you mentioned, job relocation. But nothing unique, nothing that's edging out any other demand factor that I could say at this point.
Neil Malkin: Okay great. And then for Dallas, are there any markets that you are currently in that you are seeing more opportunity, and are there potential markets that you guys have kind of identified maybe loosely, like a Denver or something or another market within California you could get more exposure to that kind of meet your criteria?
Dallas B. Tanner: It's a good question. We are really comfortable with the markets we've had, we've made that point pretty clear over the past year. Supply generally is really tight, as Ernie mentioned earlier. You have to be local to really find unique opportunities to buy right now, and we have done a good job of doing that historically and we'll continue to do that going forward. We think there's opportunity in the markets that we're in. You just got to be there every day and you got to look at everything, and you know you're going to lose out on a lot of properties due to pricing, but as long as you stay consistent, we've been able to find a way to keep buying good product at really good mark. So, you can do the hypotheticals on markets and where you wish you were and where you want, but if you look at the markets that we're in, the growth speaks for itself with the revenue side of things on the West Coast and also with some of the HPA and the way that Bruce and his team are operating on renewals. We're seeing really good growth on the West Coast, continue to see us focus there, and we'll do parts of Florida, as Ernie mentioned earlier. I mean, I think the top three markets where we invested in Q1, it will be synonymous with how we think about the year going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao: A lot of my questions have been answered here, but just wondering if we could get a little bit more color on those Florida markets. The average occupancies there were some of the biggest declines that we saw and new leasing spreads were a little bit lower there as well. I know some of it may be expiration optimization things that are going on, but just curious if there's anything else you're seeing in any of the Florida market that is notable?
Bruce A. Lavine: We're comfortable with Tampa and Orlando. I think that the two markets that you are referencing that would concern us as well would be Jacksonville, where frankly we underperformed. That is a market where our lease expiration management hurt us going into the year. That market is bouncing back. It's 95.4% as of today and we are starting to see our rate growth were up 50 bps in March from earlier in the year as well, so feeling comfortable about the bounce-back there. South Florida, we saw a rate slip, but we still see ourselves competitive in what's happening in the market there. That is a market that's experienced a little tougher, a bit of softness actually. Condo market has softened somewhat, and we've seen a spike in permits that are now deliveries in multi-family, and we've also had some additional competition in that market. But there are good things happening in the economy there. We are seeing that the market is beginning to stabilize and I feel that it will recover well.
John B. Bartling Jr.: That shadow inventory, I should just notice, is pretty much getting filled up now. We've seen the concessions go out of the market for the most part. So, we're feeling like we've turned the corner in South Florida.
Vincent Chao: And has that softness at all opened up the invest markets in those, in South Florida on Jacksonville, are you seeing that in pricing there?
Dallas B. Tanner: It depends on which submarkets you're talking about. In South Florida specifically, you've got to be a little bit careful because you can run into some trouble with different HOA issues and there are some neighborhoods you want to be careful in and around. We like that market. We like certain parts of that market, without getting too specific. It's a market where we've actually invested. We bought 25 homes in the first quarter of the 121 that we closed. So it's a market that we'll continue to invest in and we're seeing favorable cap rates and things that make sense.
Vincent Chao: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Ivy Zelman: Congratulations guys. I haven't spoken to you post IPO. Lot of attention obviously on the balance sheet and appreciating strategy and the ability to grow NOI, FFO, can you talk a little bit more about some of the headwinds that the construction industry is seeing related to labor constraints? You did a great job of reducing expenses related to CapEx and repair and maintenance, and recognizing, is that sustainable, because we see a lot pressure, upward pressure on inflation on labor? So maybe we stop there and answer that, and then we'll go to next question please.
John B. Bartling Jr.: It's John. Good to hear from you. You are clearly right that skilled labor is under demand and we are seeing a very tight labor market. That being said, I think the two benefits that we have, one is, you can have a career at Invitation Homes. Our maintenance techs can work their way up to supervisors, et cetera, and it's just not spot work. So that's very attractive with healthcare benefits. So we still have, we're an attractive employer, if you will, which allows us to stabilize much of that cost. The efficiencies also offset some of the labor pressure around there, as we continue to drive better efficiencies in how we do everything from route optimization to how we harden our assets all so differently to improve the quality of our homes and how many times we have to visit those homes. You continue to get efficiencies that offset some of that labor cost offset. But it is an issue in the industry. It is something that we're watching closely. And to the extent that it's a challenge with our vendors, the other benefit we have is, we know our vendors very well. We have one in Atlanta for instance, [indiscernible], who we've been with from the very beginning. They started with five employees, they've got 30 now, and they support us. You'll see many of those dedicated vendors and that's in large part because of our local presence and our local market expertise.
Ivy Zelman: That was very helpful, John. And just to sort of continuing on the labor, and I can sneak in another one, there is right now Assembly Bill 199 in California that is a headwind to the construction industry that's really focused on remodel or redevelopment, and I believe the single-family rental industry might be inclusive in that. Sort of wondering, what that could mean an impact to the prevailing wages for you and your labor, what that would mean for your business and how you guys are thinking about it as a risk?
John B. Bartling Jr.: I may be mistaken, Ivy, but I think they've postponed that bill to next year. But you are right, the prevailing wage law is something that California, along with rent control and some other things that are out there, that are headwinds for the industry, multi-family more so than us, but clearly there are some headwinds there. What I would say is California continues to be one of our most desirable markets. It's a great market from a quality-of-life standpoint, it's a great market in terms of limited new supply, even they continue to put more expenses into the system but it just limits the new supply that comes on. And that is really the issue in California, it's a new supply issue, not a wage issue. So, not a very concise answer but I don't – we are watching it, I don't think it's an immediate risk to us, just given the way we operate our business, but there along with other legislative efforts we do think that it will continue to curtail the new supply that comes in the market, continuing to make that an attractive investment market for us.
Ivy Zelman: Okay, we could talk about that more offline. I guess just shifting lastly to thinking about the strength that you are seeing in the West Coast markets and renewal rates, is obviously impressive, and one of the questions I guess becomes affordability, especially as you're seeing the mortgage market becoming more open to consumers, and there's more of a perception as consumers recognize they can afford to lock in at a fixed rate, that's very attractive. Where are you guys in the ability, if we look at rent versus buy for a like asset, is there a level where you are capped out to the very tenant you're now serving that might say, 'you know what, I've had enough, I'm not going to pay another 5%, 6%, 7% increase in my rent and I'm going to see obviously an opportunity to go buy', so how should we think about where there is a runway for further rent inflation and where do you get capped where you still really start to push the tenant to have to re-evaluate their fixed cost versus variable cost risk?
John B. Bartling Jr.: The only problem I have with the question, Ivy, is that it assumes that people don't make a choice about leasing lifestyle. What we are finding today is there's a secular change where millennials in particular and others, and you follow the industry better than anyone, so you can correct me, but the one thing I would say is, we are continuing to see especially in high-barrier markets like California where you might have 50% of residents in California are renters, many by choice not necessity, and they are the walk into and decide where they want to live, when they want to buy, and I think that continues to be a strong part of our business or value proposition. As for where those breakpoints are, I think it's hard for us to sit here and say that there is one breakpoint over another one. We continue to see a lot of opportunity to provide high-quality service in great locations with a fantastic product.
Ivy Zelman: Okay. Thanks guys. Good luck.
Operator: Our next question comes from Buck Horne of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Buck Horne: I just want to get a little bit more color on the resident recovery line and just how sustainable and kind of what's driving the resident recoveries? I think you mentioned it separate from the gains in other income. So just help us understand that and if there's any quarterly seasonality to that line item.
Ernest M. Freedman: This is Ernie. So, year-over-year most of that number is utility reimbursements. We do have some utilities we keep in our name, that's required in local jurisdiction, and that's about $2.4 million of that number, and that's a consistent number year-over-year. In the first quarter of this year, we started tracking very specifically in our general ledger other recoveries we were getting for damages, cleaning, things like that, things that would pop up during the security deposit. That was about $1 million in the first quarter 2017. Last year, Buck, unfortunately we weren't tracking that consistently throughout, and so we weren't comfortable providing a resident recovery number for that. We were getting some of those things last year, and those were in other income like they are in this year, but we do want to break out the reimbursement numbers, and as we think about a core margin versus a regular style margin so we can be more comparable to our peers, I would expect that you'll continue to see improvement in our numbers that we are reporting for the recovery portion for cleaning and damages, other things that our residents have done, throughout the rest of this year and then you'll see a stabilized comparison between 2017 and 2018 going forward.
Buck Horne: Okay, that's helpful. And on repairs and maintenance turn/ CapEx cost for the remainder of the year, do you think they will remain fairly consistent with the recent trends or do you see any opportunities to lower or do you think likewise you need to add more dollars to that line?
Ernest M. Freedman: Sure. I think, Buck, importantly with the first quarter is the seasonally low number. So I certainly wouldn't want folks to take the first quarter number and to annualize that. And that's one of the reasons why we've provided disclosure over the trailing five quarters for that number. Our plan or our expectations for the year was that our cost to maintain a home, from an OpEx and CapEx perspective, would be about $2,500, and we are right on that path with regards to our first quarter results. We also have an expectation, as I said earlier, that the CapEx portion of that would be about $1,000. We do still see some noise from quarter to quarter in terms of the split between OpEx and CapEx, Buck. So I wouldn't want to take the first quarter numbers and assume we'll have a similar split for the rest of the year. Instead, I'd ask folks to kind of focus on the numbers I just provided for the expectations, understanding there might be a little volatility from quarter to quarter, but those are our expectations for the entire year.
Buck Horne: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to John Bartling for any closing remarks.
John B. Bartling Jr.: Thank you, Rocco. Again, thank you everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Invitation Homes. We look forward to seeing you at the upcoming NAREIT Conference and speaking again next quarter on the success of the business. Operator, this concludes our call.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.
