===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MAA First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterward, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, May 1st, 2025. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.
Andrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team participating on the call this morning are Brad Hill, Tim Argo, Clay Holder, and Rob DelPriore. Before we begin with prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 1934 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Brad.
Brad Hill: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As detailed in our release, first quarter performance results were ahead of our expectations as strong demand was evident in multiple areas of our performance, including occupancy, collections and pricing trends. While pricing trends for new resident move-ins continue to reflect the impact from new supply delivering in several of our markets, renewal pricing remains strong and our retention rate increasing, leading to first quarter 2025 blended lease pricing that was ahead of our expectations. We are encouraged by the resilience our portfolio has displayed in the face of the unprecedented levels of new supply that we've experienced over the past year as well as our positioning to capture continued improvement as we enter the summer leasing season. As Tim will discuss in more detail, we are seeing encouraging signs that indicate leasing conditions are poised to support stable occupancy and improvement in blended lease rates that align with the outlook that we provided in our prior guidance, having a compounding impact on revenue performance throughout the year. While macroeconomic uncertainties have increased due to the potential tariffs, our exclusive focus on high-growth markets, lower average price point, broad diversification by market, submarket and price point, our operating efficiencies and scale should position MAA to weather tariff or economic challenges and allow us to take advantage of growth opportunities that may arise. Because of these portfolio characteristics, MAA has not only outperformed in previous downturns and times of uncertainty, but delivered good performance over the past year in the face of a 50-year record high level of supply. In the first quarter, we were able to increase our year-over-year occupancy by 30 basis points and produced average effective rent per unit that was only down $9 per unit from the level we achieved in first quarter of 2024. Our current metrics are indicating no material change in customer behavior. Lease and leasing traffic remains strong. Collections are solid, migration trends are positive and the challenges of single-family home availability and affordability continue to support our strong renewal performance. Our focus on customer service is paying off as reflected in our sector-leading Google scores, contributing to our growing retention rates. Supported by our asset management group, the teams are focused on harvesting the benefits of several leasing and reporting tools introduced over the past few years to maximize our operational effectiveness. We continue to invest in key areas that will support future earnings growth, including various new technology initiatives that enhance efficiencies and support our centralization and specialization efforts. We are ramping up the rollout of property-wide Wi-Fi across our portfolio and investments in our interior renovation and repositioning programs are increasing. On the external growth front, our pipeline of lease-ups and active developments stand at a combined cost of $1.5 billion. Our operating performance at these properties should benefit from a supply environment that is trending below historical levels. We continue to believe investing in new developments will produce strong future earnings growth, especially considering the declining new starts and additional headwinds from decreased equity capital available for new projects. We anticipate starting between three to four new developments this year with a suburban development in the Charleston, South Carolina market on track to start construction during the second quarter. Based on our expected starts and completions for the year, our development pipeline should remain in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion range, a very comfortable level given our scale and balance sheet strength. We are focused on acquiring properties where we can utilize our various platform capabilities to generate attractive long-term returns for capital. But with the transaction market pretty slow, it will likely be the back half of the year before we see more compelling opportunities begin to materialize. As part of our ongoing recycling efforts to improve the earnings quality of our portfolio, during the first quarter of 2025, we exited Columbia, South Carolina with the sale of two properties with an average age of 32 years that went under contract in 2024. We expect continued recycling efforts to occur later this year. With a 30-year performance record focused on high-growth markets and an average executive team member tenure of 16 years, we have operated through prior cycles of high supply and uncertainty. I remain optimistic about the approaching recovery cycle and our market's ability to absorb the new supply. Today, our more diversified and higher-quality portfolio, stronger operating platform and stronger balance sheet position us to compete at an even higher level. Our high-growth markets continue to see stronger job growth, household formation, and investor demand. Through our internal and external investments, we have meaningful future value growth on the horizon as new supply deliveries decline and leasing conditions strengthen. We remain excited about the outlook over the next few years. To all our associates at the properties and our corporate and regional offices, thank you for your hard work and dedication in preparation for the busy leasing season. Your commitment and dedication to our residents and fellow associates are greatly appreciated. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Following up on Brad's comments, we are encouraged by the first quarter operating trends with blended pricing, occupancy and collections all slightly outperforming our expectations. We entered 2025 with occupancy and exposure in a strong position that helped drive a steady increase in pricing, particularly on our new leases. The acceleration in new lease-over-lease pricing growth was greater than what we have seen on average historically, increasing 180 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2024. The resulting new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis for the first quarter was negative 6.3%. Additionally, renewal rates for the quarter showed strength, growing 4.5% on a lease-over-lease basis, which was a 30 basis point increase sequentially over the fourth quarter. The resulting lease-over-lease pricing on a blended basis was negative 0.5%, which represented a 160 basis point improvement sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2024. Average physical occupancy was 95.6%, up 30 basis points as compared to the same period in 2024. Collections continue to outperform expectations with net delinquency representing just 0.3% of billed rents. These factors combined drove the resulting same-store revenue growth of 0.1% for the quarter. Many of the markets that were outperformers in 2024 from a blended lease-over-lease pricing standpoint continued to do well in the first quarter of 2025, including several of our mid-tier markets. Virginia stands out with Richmond, Norfolk, Fredericksburg, and our four Northern Virginia properties, all exceeding the portfolio average. Charleston, Savannah, and Greenville also demonstrated strong pricing power. Of our larger markets, Tampa continued to show pricing recovery. Houston held steady. And encouragingly, we saw significantly improved performance from Atlanta, particularly as compared to market conditions there in the first quarter of 2024. Austin remains the laggard as it continues to face significant supply pressure with Phoenix and Nashville continuing to struggle with lingering supply concerns also. Touching on our lease-up portfolio, we had one property, MAA Optimus Park reached stabilization in the quarter. Our seven remaining lease-up properties are competing well against the record new supply being delivered in our markets and ended the quarter with a combined occupancy of 71.6%. We pushed the expected stabilization date back one quarter for MAA Bogie Creek in Orlando and expect six of the seven lease-up properties to stabilize in 2025. Rents for the group continue to exceed our pro forma expectations and should result in significant value creation for this portfolio. We continue to execute on our various redevelopment and repositioning initiatives in the first quarter, and we expect to accelerate these programs over the course of 2025 and into 2026. For the first quarter of 2025, we completed 1,102 interior unit upgrades, achieving rent increases of $90 above non-upgraded units and a cash-on-cash return of just under 18%. Despite this more competitive supply environment, these units were vacant on average nine days less than nonrenovated units when adjusted for the additional turn time. We expect to renovate even more units in Q2 and Q3 with a goal to renovate approximately 6,000 units in 2025 with an even larger increase expected in 2026. For our repositioning program, we have effectively completed the repricing phase on all the legacy 2023, 2024 projects with NOI yields approaching 10%. We have an additional six projects finishing up construction that will begin the repricing phase between now and July in what we believe will be a strengthening leasing environment. We are also now live on the four property-wide Wi-Fi retrofit projects we began in 2024 and are currently in the planning or construction phase for an additional 23 projects that we targeted for 2025. As we close out April, we continue to see encouraging trends that are aligned with our guidance. New lease and blended pricing in April improved as compared to both March and the full first quarter with average daily occupancy for the month of 95.5%. Our 60-day exposure for April was 8.4%, 20 basis points lower than this time last year. It keeps us in a position for stable occupancy to allow for pricing power, assuming the strong demand we have seen to date remains intact. On the demand side, absorption in our markets in the first quarter was at a record level and represented the third straight quarter units absorbed exceeded units delivered, putting our markets in a good position to achieve a robust recovery as supply continues to decline. Additionally, the percentage of our residents accepting renewal offers exceeds last year's record level with lease-over-lease growth rates on renewals accepted for May and June outpacing our strong year-to-date renewal growth rates. The lower turnover is another mitigating factor against supply pressure with fewer units coming to market. Improving new lease rates should further help support continued strong renewal performance throughout the spring and summer leasing season. That's all the way I have in the prepared comments. Now, I'll turn the call over to Clay.
Clay Holder: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.20 per diluted share, which was $0.04 per share above the midpoint of our first quarter guidance. About $0.025 of the favorability was due to same-store NOI performance with an additional $0.025 due to favorable timing of overhead and interest expenses, partially offset by $0.01 of non-same-store NOI performance. In addition to our same-store revenue performance slightly exceeding our expectations, real estate tax expense was favorable in the quarter due to the timing of tax litigation settlements that were initially projected to be completed in the second quarter. Personnel costs, repair and maintenance expenses, and marketing costs were all generally in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we funded approximately $67 million in development cost of the current $852 million pipeline, leaving an expected $305 million to be funded on our current pipeline over the next two to three years. We also invested approximately $17 million of capital in the first quarter through our redevelopment, repositioning and Wi-Fi retrofit initiatives that Tim spoke of earlier. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and our low net debt-to-EBITDA at 4 times, our balance sheet is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities should they emerge. At quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 94% fixed with an average maturity of seven years at an effective rate of 3.8%. Finally, with much of the leasing season still ahead of us, coupled with the uncertain macroeconomic environment, we are maintaining our core FFO and same-store guidance for the year. As outlined in our release, we expect core FFO for the second quarter of 2025 to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.21 per diluted share or $2.13 per share at the midpoint. This midpoint includes the timing impact of the real estate tax litigation settlement previously discussed, along with the typical seasonality of leasing and maintenance-related operating expenses. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Regina, we will now turn the call back to you for questions.
Operator: We will now open the call up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Eric Wolfe: Hey thanks. So, right now, I guess we're at the beginning of May. I assume most people probably sign a new lease about a month before they move in, but correct me if I'm wrong on that. So, is it just fair to say that you have a pretty good idea of where new lease spreads will be in late May or early June? Or do you still not have visibility into that yet?
Tim Argo: Hey Eric, this is Tim. We do have pretty good visibility. Obviously, on the renewal side, we have really good visibility with 60-day notice required there. And to your point, on the new lease side, I mean, it varies. You do get a lot of people that are looking to move in more immediately in that zero to seven-day range, but we've put a little bit of extra focus on pre-leasing that has pushed that out a little bit. So, we probably have even a little more color or a little more visibility this year than we did this time last year. So, yes, we've got a fair amount of visibility. Certainly, April new leases, we know those. I would say we probably have a good handle on, call it, half of the May new leases and probably 25% or so of the June new leases.
Eric Wolfe: Got it. Yes. And I asked the question mainly because if you kind of look at the first quarter, it's tracking pretty similarly to what you saw last year. And so I think what people are trying to figure out is, are you seeing anything in the recent data, whether that's April, May, June, that gives you more confidence in this inflection in rent growth that companies are predicting because so far, the results have been a bit like last year. So, what kind of gives you the confidence based on recent activity that you're going to see that inflection?
Tim Argo: Yes, I mean we're continuing to see, like I said, particularly when we look at our pre-leasing activity, we're continuing to see those new lease rates accelerate. And so if you look at kind of where we are December through to April, we were almost negative 9% on new leases in December and then up to negative 4.6% in April and saw a continued steady acceleration. I would expect that to continue into Q2. And then typically, Q3 continues to accelerate a little from there, obviously, dependent on how the economic environment plays out. But from what we're seeing right now, we feel pretty good where we are.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Daniel Tricarico: Hey good morning. It's Daniel Tricarico on with Nick. Maybe to follow up on Eric's question on the -- maybe the confidence level of the blends. How should we think about the comp period related to concessions and the burn-off impact as we get into the second and third quarters?
Tim Argo: Well, I mean, certainly, all the -- when you hear us quote lease-over-lease rates that is net of concessions and includes us sort of spreading those concessions out. So there's nothing specifically there. But I would say, whether you want to call it easier comps or however you want to think about that, that is playing a part in this. We saw a struggle with new lease rates for most of 2024 and continued into the lower rates continuing in early 2025. So there's -- you combine the normal seasonality, combined declining supply pressure and frankly, a little bit easier comps, that helps give us confidence in where we're sitting today.
Daniel Tricarico: Great. Thanks. And then a follow-up on development. Is there a potential to extend lease-up expectations at any of your other development properties? And how should we think about the supply impact potentially being stretched out into 2026 in some of these markets that are still working through that pipeline?
Brad Hill: I mean I think in terms -- this is Brad. In terms of development, in particular, I mean, we feel good about the dates that we have in terms of lease-up performance in our packet. I mean, for us, one of the important things is we want to be able to protect the revenue performance of those properties and the rent performance of those properties. And given certainly our focus there, we're able to be a little bit more patient on the lease-up performance. And so in our packet, we have a couple of our lease-ups that have leased up a little bit slower than what we expected. But the good news is the rents that we're getting from those properties continue to outperform our expectations, the yield expectations, again, outperform what our expectations are. So, we continue to believe that the lease-up focus that we have will continue to perform in line with our expectations, and they're outperforming on the rent side. So we feel really good about the lease-ups that we have at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cooper Clark with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Cooper Clark: Hi thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about the cost side of development and how much is more or less locked in when you begin construction? And then also if you could touch on the same thing for the redevelopment pipeline as well?
Brad Hill: Yes, this is Brad. I'll hit on development. Tim can talk about redevelopment. Normally, when we -- it depends on if the development is an in-house development versus a pre-purchased development. In our pre-purchase pipeline, our development partner is giving us a construction cost guarantee. So effectively, the costs are locked in when we go to agreement. So, we shouldn't face any pressure associated with those pre-purchase developments that we have ongoing. For our in-house development, normally, those are, call it, 95% or so locked in. When we go under construction, the buyout from the GCs are normally done pretty quickly from when we start construction on the project. So, those are generally locked in as well. So we're not seeing any impact to construction costs for in-place developments to-date. And for new developments that we're looking at, we're really not seeing any impact to date of potential impacts from tariffs or the immigration changes and the impact that could have on the labor side. In fact, what we're hearing from some of our contractors is given the reduction in the new starts and the supply pipeline that we're getting better pricing at the moment from many of our GCs and development partners. Margins are tightening up a bit and they're getting a little bit hungrier for new starts. So, we're seeing that at the moment on the new development side. Tim?
Tim Argo: Yes. And I'll touch on the redevelopment. And no pressure we're seeing so far, and I don't really expect any this year on that component. For one, appliances make up about 25% of our cost in terms of our overall unit redevelopment, and we have locked in pricing on those through about this time next year. And then we have several sources and availability on countertops and other things. So, we pretty much source -- we know how many units we're going to do, and we have a plan for those units and have a lot of that already here in place, if you will. So, if tariff concerns or others plays on for a while, it could start to impact us late this year into 2026, but not seeing any pressure right now.
Cooper Clark: Great. thanks. And then if you could also just touch on urban versus suburban performance in some of your key markets? And if it's fair to say that there's more upside to urban here over the next few years as supply normalizes just given the higher density?
Tim Argo: Yes, I mean, to answer the second part of your question, I think there's probably a little more upside potential on the more urban assets, primarily because they've tended to get more of the supply over these last couple of years. So, I think as that supply dies down, it probably helps out that group in general a little more. But we've seen -- in our portfolio, we've seen the performance between urban and suburban pretty much converge. There's very minor differences now in what we're seeing with occupancy or pricing. The suburban had been outperforming probably for the last couple of years relatively significantly, and that gap has narrowed as supply pressure has started to wane a little bit. It's obviously market-by-market. Atlanta is one where we're still seeing better performance outside the perimeter, if you will, as compared to inside our Midtown Buckhead areas. But generally, we're seeing that performance start to converge.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jana Galan: Thank you. Good morning. Maybe if you could talk a little bit more about that improvement that you're seeing in Atlanta. From the market data, it's still pretty weak, but that's very encouraging that your portfolio is seeing a turnaround.
Tim Argo: Yes. And I would say, Atlanta, it's certainly on a relative basis. It's not -- I'm not counting it as one of our top markets right now, certainly in terms of performance. But relative to where it was for most of 2024, it is starting to show some improvement. Our new lease pricing in Atlanta is the best it's been since going back to mid- to early 2023. And we've seen a little bit of occupancy recovery as well. We're about 20 basis points or so better in terms of occupancy than we were this time last year. So it's certainly a relative story compared to -- if you look at it compared to the broader portfolio, it still lags our portfolio a little bit, but it's much improved from where it was this time last year.
Jana Galan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Adam Kramer: Hey, thanks for the time guys. Just wondering about the kind of level of concessions in your markets today, maybe just high level. And then how does that compare to whether it's early in the year when seasonally slower period or even a year ago, maybe just again, level of concessions today maybe versus a year ago?
Tim Argo: Yes, we've seen concessions broadly be relatively consistent the last couple of quarters and probably down a little bit from where it was this time last year. I would say the portfolio broadly or markets broadly anywhere from a half month to a month is pretty consistent. There are pockets, obviously, where it's a little bit higher. There's lease-ups probably more in that month and a half, two-month range. But broadly, we're seeing kind of half a month to a month be pretty consistent in most markets. It's a little bit lower from where it was this time last year, pretty consistent with where it was in Q4 of 2024.
Adam Kramer: Great. And then just on kind of capital allocation and cost of capital here. Obviously, the stock has done a little bit better than some of the peers year-to-date. I was wondering how you kind of view your equity cost of capital, your debt cost of capital, I guess, even disposition cost of capital? And when it comes to kind of funding these developments, funding other sources or other uses rather, how do you kind of assess both the cost of capital and the capital allocation priorities here?
Brad Hill: Yes. This is Brad, Adam. And I think given where we are in terms -- as Clay mentioned and given where our current leverage is at 4 times, I mean, we view our kind of incremental dollar at this point, the best place to pull that from is generally through debt. And so really, at this point, given that leverage level, we could grow our debt by $1 billion, $1.5 billion or so and still be okay and within the ranges of kind of where we think our credit metrics need to be. So we think that, that's the best use of our capital at this point. And you'll see us continue to fund through debt anything incremental. And certainly, as we continue to sell properties this year, as we did in the first quarter, we'll continue to sell some properties later this year. That will also be a source of capital for our external growth uses as well. So, that's where it will come from.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks for lot for taking my questions. New lease growth was down in December by 9%. You've seen some sequential improvement in April to down 4.6%. I believe last quarter, you spoke to new lease growth hitting positive at some point this year. So, are you still on track to achieve this based on what you've seen so far this year? Or has the environment changed to the point where maybe that's not as likely this year? Thanks.
Tim Argo: I think we still have an expectation that we could see it go slightly positive, call it, mid-third quarter or so. We don't expect it to get significantly positive. We have just slightly positive and then starting to trend back down as we get into Q4. So, there's probably a little more uncertainty right now just given what's going on in the economy. But generally, the trends we're seeing would support that, and that's what we're expecting as of right now.
Michael Goldsmith: Got it. And then as a follow-up, you sold out of the Columbia, South Carolina market. Are there other markets that you can sell out of where you maybe don't have sufficient scale to kind of really do what you're looking to do? And so are there other markets you could look to sell out of? And how -- if you reallocate those proceeds into markets where you do have scale, how much benefit can that have on expenses over time, closing down markets where you don't have scale and reinvesting it where you can?
Brad Hill: Yes, this is Brad. I mean, certainly, we'll look to continue to drive efficiencies through our portfolio. And I do think one way to do that is for us to continue to sell some of these markets where we may have one or two assets. And we still have a few of those. We've got one in Panama City. We've got one in Gulfport or Gulf Shores. We've got two in Las Vegas. So, in markets where we only have a couple of assets, certainly, by selling those, we can reallocate the time and energies specifically of our regional folks to other properties to drive efficiencies throughout the portfolio. So, we'll continue to evaluate that every fourth quarter, we go through an evaluation process to look at properties that we have in our portfolio and begin to look at those and prioritize what our disposition needs are for the following year. So, that will continue to be a focus of ours, along with looking at properties where perhaps the growth rate is not what we desire from our portfolio or the CapEx needs are growing, and it's just not a fit for our portfolio anymore, but that's a very thorough process that we go through every year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Julien Blouin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Julien Blouin: Thank you for taking my question. Your markets have tended to be relatively resilient during past recessions, but do you worry a recession this time around would potentially be different just given the amount of supply you're still dealing with, vacancy still pretty elevated, pricing power as a starting point is weaker. So, do you think maybe performance this time would be worse than in the past?
Brad Hill: Well, this is Brad. And as we look at certainly the demand fundamentals in our region of the country, no, I mean, we would not think that if there were a slowdown in the economy that we would expect any type of different performance in our region of the country than we have experienced historically. Certainly, as you mentioned, if you go back to the three previous downturns that we've seen, whether it's the 2002 or 2003 tech bubble, the 2009 GFC or 2020 COVID, the performance of our portfolio significantly exceeded what we saw out of our peers, and we have every reason to believe that, that continues. And I would say, certainly, when the economy slows, we have historically seen our high-growth markets hold up better than the national norms as the broad diversification of industries and employers, coupled with more affordable employment costs as compared particularly to other regions of the country have tended to drive that resiliency you just talked about within our markets. And I think for us, specifically, our unique diversification by market and submarket, our product types, our price point and then the diversification between large and mid-tier markets has continued to provide steadier performance for us. And we think that is a component that will certainly continue. And then the other thing that we've seen in the Sunbelt, particularly over the last five years or so is just the Sunbelt job machine continues to outperform. We've seen numerous knowledge-based employment growth come to our region of the country. And then what we also have seen that I think is very important is the local and municipal governments are stronger than they are in other regions of the country. And I think that really supports the pro-business view of this region of the country. It also supports the ability to add subsidies and incentives to really support the job locations and relocations that we've seen. So, no, we think, especially as potential onshoring continues and picks up speed, the Sunbelt is in a pretty good position to take advantage of that. And then the other point I would just make relative to demand, certainly, job growth is a component of that. And as I just laid out, we think that continues to perform quite well in our region of the country going forward. But there are other demand drivers in our region of the country that continue to perform pretty well. Migration trends continue to be positive. The single-family availability and affordability is a challenge in our region of the country. And that's also a challenge that I think is a newer challenge to our region of the country. It's perhaps always existed in some of the coastal markets, but it's newer in our region of the country. But I do think that's a phenomenon that's going to drive retention rates up over the long-term. And today, our turnover is 41.5%. Two years ago, it was 46%. So that 5% reduction is a long-term trend that I think will stay low and that there's significant implications for that. So, long-term, we think that the Sunbelt continues to perform quite well regardless of the economic view that's out there. And then we think that our portfolio, in particular, for the diversification reasons I mentioned, continues to perform well.
Julien Blouin: Great. Thank you. That’s all from me.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Good morning. Based on your second quarter and your full year guidance, you'll need to achieve about a 2.5% to 3% increase in FFO per share compared to what you'll achieve in the first half of the year. I'm wondering how much of that is driven by seasonality in rents? And what are some of the other factors that will contribute to ramp up earnings?
Clay Holder: Yes. John, I think in addition to the seasonality factors that you pointed out, the other piece of that, that should continue to benefit FFO over the course of the remainder of the year is our lease-up properties and as they continue to gain the velocity and go back to the points that Brad and Tim mentioned earlier, the pricing power that those properties have continued to show are ahead of our pro forma. So we think that this both on pricing and also on an NOI yield basis. So, all of that, we think will -- is really what's going to drive that continued acceleration in performance over the course of the year.
John Kim: And you reiterated your outlook to roll out Wi-Fi in 23 projects this year. Can you just remind us what contribution that is to your same-store revenue for this year? And what's the timing of the completion or the rollout of the remainder of your portfolio?
Tim Argo: John, this is Tim. So, it's not a huge component this year. So we have the 4 that we completed late last year and then the 23 that, as I mentioned, are under construction now. We're down in about between $1 million and $1.5 million combined between those 27 projects, I guess, it is for 2025 just based on the rollout and how those roll out over lease expirations and the timing of the construction. Those two -- those 27 in general, we expect would contribute close to $6 million once everything gets fully rolled out. And so we're doing the 23 this year. we'll want to make sure that sort of goes as planned, and we would potentially look to accelerate that even more so in 2026. But it is going to be a multiyear project over the next four or five years would be my guess as we continue to accelerate it and ultimately look to roll it out to most, if not all, of the portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hey. Good morning everyone. Can you talk about maybe your markets that are surprising to the upside and to the downside versus initial expectations?
Tim Argo: Sure, Wes. This is Tim. The good ones, and I mentioned several of them in the prepared comments, not any huge surprises there, the ones that have been pretty strong for the last 12 months or so continue to be strong. Tampa is one that I highlighted, I believe, in the last quarter that we could see some upside, and that has started to play out. So that would be one that I would point to that's on the up cycle. I mentioned Atlanta being an improvement relative to where that one had been. And then Jacksonville is another where it's still a laggard in general, but it's showing some pretty good acceleration and some resilience despite some heavy supply there. So, that's another one that was in one of our bottom three or four markets last year that I would expect to show a little bit more strength there. So that would probably be one that I would put in the little bit of the surprise category. And then I really mentioned the ones that are still laggards, Austin, Phoenix, and Nashville are the three that I would point out there that just continue to work through quite a bit of supply.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then for your insurance renewal that's coming up, any change in thought there?
Clay Holder: Yes. We're still kind of in the process of working through that. Still a little early on. We'll have more to say about it whenever we release second quarter earnings. But just the initial conversations we've had have been positive, and so we'll have more to come.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Mike on with Haendel. My question is, can you just provide a little bit more detail on the cadence you're expecting in both your blended spreads throughout the remaining three quarters of the year and your same-store rent?
Tim Argo: Well, as far as the blended trend, I mean, pretty consistent with what we talked about last quarter and pretty consistent with what I would say is more normal seasonality. So we continue to expect our blended for Q1 was negative 0.5%. We continue to expect to see that push forward in both Q2 and Q3 and then moderate a little bit in Q4. But we talked about the trajectory of new lease pricing and what we're seeing there. Encouragingly, on the renewals, May and June look really strong and sending out July right now, which we expect to be strong as well. So we think the renewals will continue to have a bigger part of that mix. We continue to see the renewal accept rates be stronger than what they were last year. And then obviously, the rates we're getting there. So, I think the mix between new lease and renewal is probably a little heavier weighted towards renewal than what we had in right at the beginning of the year. But generally, the trends and trajectory is about the same as what we started the year with.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. That's helpful. And just one follow-up. Can you give any color on potential impact of immigration policy and demand trends for the Sunbelt markets that are lagging in the second half of this year?
Brad Hill: This is Brad. Certainly, we're keeping an eye on the immigration trends. We're frankly not seeing much of an impact on that at this point from an operating perspective. We're not seeing much of an impact either on the construction side, which is, I think, where perhaps we could see -- we are likely to see some impact there if it manifests itself. But at this point, we're not seeing much of an impact on immigration the immigration policy changes at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning down there. First question is, when do you think that you guys would have a sense of how much of the competitive supply potentially slips into next year? Just curious.
Tim Argo: Well, I mean, nothing that we're seeing right now. There's been a little bit of slowdown in some lease-ups in some part in submarkets. But broadly, the supply picture looks pretty much like it has or like we've thought for the last few quarters where we're continuing to see it slowly moderate. I mean we're still obviously at a higher than normal delivery cadence. So even though 2025 is lower than 2024, it's still what I would call above normal. But 2026, we expect that to drop pretty significantly to where it's below a long-term average. So, as we've said kind of all along, I think where you really start to see that strength is late 2025, which will be offset by some normal seasonality that tends to wane. But 2026 is when we really expect to see that acceleration.
Alexander Goldfarb: And then the second question is on the leasing front, you guys have spoken about good visibility out 60 days. But do you see leasing as a good healthy leading indicator? Or your view is still apartments are lagging because if there's any job disruption or any tightening of the belt, it takes a while before the renter ends up downsizing or doing something different.
Tim Argo: I think leasing is -- one, it's a better leading indicator than it has been. I think we just have more transparency and more data and more information that we look at and different cuts of it to where I talked about pre-leasing earlier. We can see what's out there. And so the new lease rates, in particular, are that nice edge. That's somebody who's out in the market, they're looking for somewhere to live. They can shop all of the comps. So I think it's a leading indicator. And then as much or more so, things like collections and move-outs and reasons for move-outs, those can be pretty good indicators as well. Typically, you're going to start to see along with new lease pricing, you're going to see people having to move out perhaps before their lease term or early terms with job loss or other things or people not able to pay their rents and see delinquency uptick. So, between the three of those, those are relatively good leading indicators, but not seeing any concerns there certainly on any of those right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Brad, are you seeing any meaningful changes in the acquisition volumes in your markets and pricing expectations given this market turmoil rates and the potential that not all the tax cuts get passed in reconciliation?
Brad Hill: Well, we've certainly seen a reduction in terms of the number of deals here in, call it, April. I mean, first quarter is hard to gauge because a lot of the deals that closed in first quarter went under contract in 2024. We did see a slight uptick in the number of deals that we tracked in the first quarter. I'd say the volume of deals on the market here in April has dropped significantly in our market. So I would say the volume definitely has dropped. The pricing that we've seen, I would say, has been still pretty consistent, sub-5% cap rates in general on everything that we've seen trade. So, there's certainly uncertainty out there that's impacting volume. But at this point, it doesn't seem to be impacting price.
Rob Stevenson: All right. That's helpful. And then, Tim, what's the cadence of the comps on a year-over-year basis throughout the year? Do you get consistently easier comps on like a same-store revenue basis as we move throughout the year with the fourth quarter being the easiest? Or are there pockets between now and end of the year where you had particular strength in 2024 and that the comps aren't as easy?
Tim Argo: Well, certainly, as we get late in the year in the fourth quarter, those will be the easiest comps in terms of that's when our new lease pricing troughed. But I will say, even during Q2 and Q3 of last year, while that was our biggest strength on the new lease rates on a relative basis, we saw our best rates, if you will, that part of 2024, we didn't see quite the acceleration in those quarters that we typically do last year. So, it didn't -- in other words, the new lease rates didn't accelerate as much in Q2 and Q3 last year as they typically do. So, while the new lease rates were the absolute highest the middle of last year, I think they still present some decent comps in terms of where they are compared to normal. So, there's a bit of comp benefit the rest of the year, but certainly the most as you get late in the year. And then you factor in, obviously, we expect to continue to see less impact from supply. So, that can help to accelerate some of that in the late in 2025.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ann Chan with Green Street. Please go ahead.
Ann Chan: Hey, good morning. Just jumping back to the topic of lease-ups or more specifically, can you provide some context on what issues are causing occupancy to decline at the MAA Vale lease-up in Raleigh?
Tim Argo: Yes, this is Tim. I can hit on that one. I mean, certainly, we saw some slowdown just seasonally in terms of traffic and leads and the qualified traffic. There were some flooding issues there, frankly, that slowed down the lease-up as well that we have now fixed. And what we've seen over the last 45 days or so is that the leads and leasing both have picked up pretty significantly. So lead volume is up 50% or so in April as compared to March, and we've done 39 net leases over the last 45 days, which is about double where we were trending before. So, we're trending back towards 70% now. So there's a little bit of uniqueness there and then combine that with the time of the year and seasonality, but I feel like it's back on track at this point.
Ann Chan: Okay. Thank you. And just a second question for me. Are there any expense line items that you expect may deviate meaningfully from your initial guidance as the year progresses?
Clay Holder: Ann, this is Clay. No, I would say at this point in the year, we're still pretty lined up with what the expectations we had presented at just a couple of months ago. No real changes across the board on any -- really any of those line items.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Doug Horne: Hey thanks. Good morning. Wonder if you could speak a little bit about the trends you saw in terms of move-outs to buy and -- or purchase a single-family home. I think you mentioned that, that hit a new record low in the quarter. Just wondering like what kind of anecdotal feedback you're hearing from customers that either in that decision process? And really just wondering how sustainable you think those trends are going forward?
Tim Argo: Yes, Doug, this is Tim. We did see a continued significant drop in move-outs to buy a home. It represented about 12% of our move-outs in Q1, which was down 16% or so from where it was this time last year. And I think it's a combination of two things. The biggest one, obviously, is just the affordability issue of single-family home pricing is even as rents have moderated, call it, over the last 12 to 18 months, single-family home prices have continued to go up and then mortgage rates obviously are pretty elevated as well. So even if you were to put a 20% down payment right now to buy a house on average in one of our markets would be about 40% to 50% higher cost before you even consider things like tax and insurance. So I think affordability continues to be the biggest thing. And then I think with some of the increased uncertainty in the economy, people just tend to stay put where they are. I think that's helping to benefit our turnover and people just a little more hesitant to make big life decisions like that. And then thirdly, I think there is a transition over the last few years just in terms of how many people want to buy a house or want the flexibility or the lifestyle that the apartments can provide. So, while I don't think it stays as low forever, I don't think it gets back to the levels that we saw in past times either.
Doug Horne: Got you. But you weren't seeing like a concurrent uptick in move-outs to rent a single-family house necessarily for you?
Tim Argo: No. It was down a little bit as well, frankly.
Doug Horne: Got you. And just one last quick one. Just thinking about Houston and maybe some of the Texas markets, given where energy prices are in this particular cycle, are you watching the energy sector, in particular as it relates to kind of your Texas markets? And how do you think job growth trends might play out in this particular cycle there?
Tim Argo: I mean nothing that we're necessarily watching more than more than we ever do. I mean Houston for one has diversified their economy quite a bit. It's still heavily energy dependent, but has a lot of other industries that have popped up, and it's continued to be a strong market for us. Supply there has been really, really low, about -- between that and D.C., our lowest supply markets and continues to have good household formation, job growth and population growth. So, no concerns there. And I think all the Texas markets will continue to be huge job generators and job machines regardless of what's going on in the energy sector.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kim with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Alex Kim: Hey thanks for taking my question. Just one for me here. The spread between renewals and new move-in rent growth tightened slightly from the end of last year this quarter, and it still remains historically wide. I was just curious how renewal rent growth has remained as resilient despite the gap and what this dynamic means for your higher expectation for renewals as a percentage of signed leases?
Tim Argo: Well, as you said, the gap did narrow a little bit in Q1 and even more so in April. And so even though on a percentage basis, it's a pretty wide gap. On a dollar basis for April, for example, it's about $130 or so gap between the absolute rents on new leases versus renewals. So it's not as huge as you may think. But we've continued -- we've had this larger than normal, if you will, gap now for six, seven quarters and continue to get in that 4.25%, 4.5% range on renewals. And if I look out for what we're achieving for both May and June renewals, we're in the 4.7, 4.8 range on those and continuing to get even higher accept rates than we did last year, which was record level of accept rates. So, I think you got to remember the process we go through and the customer service that's involved and everything that goes into renewal, it's a lot more than just what is that absolute rate maybe compared to street rents. There's a lot of other factors and costs that play into it, and we do a very detailed analysis of what we are going to send out as our renewal rates. And then Brad mentioned in his comments, have the highest Google scores of anybody in the sector, that certainly plays into it. So nothing right now, we can look out even into July and still seeing strong renewal accept rates and rental rates.
Alex Kim: Got it. That's helpful. I guess just a quick follow-up here then. Any markets in particular where that spread is tighter than the average or even just wider than average just to provide some basis?
Tim Argo: It varies a little bit here and there, but not significantly. I mean, with what we've seen in the cadence of supply being pretty consistent across most markets, the seasonality or the gaps and all that have been relatively consistent across most of our markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Yes, thanks. Hi everybody. For new lease spreads, I think you said last quarter that the full year average would be around minus 1.5%. You now have a third of the year locked in. I think the math on that would be like high minus 5s, and that might imply something close to zero for the rest of the year. So I guess, are you still confident in the minus 1.5%? Or is the higher renewal acceptance rate offsetting maybe a lower new lease target?
Tim Argo: Yes, we did -- we tweaked our forecast a little bit in terms of that mix. I mean, generally, we're -- as we said, with our guidance, maintaining the guidance where we were, our overall expectation of blended pricing is pretty much in the same spot it was before. But we did dial in a little bit heavier mix, a little bit more on the renewal side. A little bit -- we tweaked our new lease expectations a little bit, not significantly, but down a little bit just really based on the uncertainty and some of the economics and seeing how that will play out over the next few months, but broadly haven't changed a lot from where we were coming out of Q4.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then on D.C., obviously, a pretty small exposure for you guys, but I'm hoping that leads to maybe an unbiased opinion. Are you seeing anything there from DOGE? And what do you expect to happen as the layoffs and buyouts sort of accumulate?
Tim Argo: Yes. Right now, we're not seeing anything. It's -- if I look at April and some of the more leading indicators in our D.C. market, the move-outs are down in April, even where they were this time last year. We're well over 96% occupancy in that market. And to your point, it's not a huge market for us. We have one property in the district, but it's a JV property that we only own 35%. We have four Northern Virginia, two that are a little more close in Pentagon City and Tysons Corner and then two that are a little further out. And then we have four or five properties in Fredericksburg, which Fredericksburg is our best market across the portfolio right now. And so I think Tysons, for example, any weakness we're seeing in terms of job loss is being offset by return to work and some tech jobs that are in that market that are having to return to work as well. And then we're seeing nothing really changed with some of the ones that are a little further out. So, a long way of saying no impact as of right now and anything we're looking at and continues to be a strong, yet not a super high concentration market for us.
Operator: And we have no further questions. I'll return the call to MAA for closing remarks.
Brad Hill: All right. No other comments for us. If you guys have any questions, feel free to reach out, and we look forward to seeing you guys in about a month.
Operator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MAA Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, February 6, 2025. The I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MMA for opening comments.
Andrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Ian, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team participating on the call this morning are Eric Bolton, Brad Hill, Tim Argo, Clay Holder; and Rob DelPriore. Before we begin with prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. As reported in our earnings release, MAA finished calendar year 2024 in line with our expectations and is in a great position for the recovery cycle for apartment leasing that should be increasingly evident over the course of this year. While we are still working through the impact of record high levels of new supply delivered over the past year, we are encouraged with some of the early recovery trends that we are capturing with lease-over-lease pricing performance. While it would take some time for the recovery momentum to build, it seems clear tide is starting to turn, and we look forward to a productive spring and summer leasing season when the improving trends will have a more obvious compounding impact on overall portfolio results late this year and into 2026. Before turning the call over to Brad, I did want to take just a few minutes this morning and tell you why I'm excited and confident about the prospects for MAA's earnings outlook over the emerging recovery cycle. It starts with my confidence that our leadership team. As we disclosed in December, effective April 1, we plan to execute on the next step in our CEO succession planning program. And Brad, will assume the role of President and CEO. I'll remain active in supporting Brad and our Board as Executive Chairman. Brad and his executive leadership team have an average tenure of 6 years with our company. I know this leadership team well, and I have a lot of confidence in them. Brad and his team have a deep understanding of our strategy and our approach to executing on that strategy, which has delivered sector-leading long-term results for shareholder capital. Beyond my confidence in our leadership team, while our markets have more recently been challenged with a 50-year high record of new supply deliveries, there is increasing evidence that the worst of the pressure from this new supply is poised to materially moderate especially as we get into the summer leasing season. As we have discussed, we historically have seen the actual delivery and leasing pressure from competing new development at roughly 2 years after the start of construction. Based on our analysis, the volume of new construction started in calendar year 2023 or 2 years ago, dropped 39% and from the peak of starts during the extraordinary low interest rate environment in calendar year 2022 and then start to sequentially drop another 50% in calendar year 2024. So this is expected to result in a significant decline in actual unit deliveries starting this year and into 2026 and 2027. Given where we are currently with interest rates and construction loss, we continue to see challenges in the market's ability to meaningfully restart and increase in new projects. Taken together, we believe these conditions will manifest in a sharp drop in new supply delivery starting this year and continuing for several years. In addition to the supply dynamic and the impact of leasing conditions, we believe that our portfolio is uniquely well positioned to capture the benefits from job growth, population growth and high single-family housing costs. This continues to drive a resulting growth in the demand for apartment housing across our markets that will outpace national trends over the long haul. This strong positioning for the demand side of the equation coupled with the material drop in new supply this year and beyond, we believe will have a significant impact on market rent growth across the portfolio for the next few years. Furthermore, I'm excited about the various new tech initiatives we have underway, aimed at driving enhanced services for our residents and more efficiencies within our operating platform. Several new initiatives that we have more recently implemented coupled with new projects that will launch over the coming year, we expect will further increase our margin and accelerate earnings over the next few years. And finally, our external growth pipeline is stronger and larger than any time in our company history. We have several new projects slated to deliver over the emerging recovery cycle with other new sites already lined up. And importantly, the balance sheet is strong and well positioned to continue to support this growth. So in summary, the experience and proven capabilities of our leadership team, our orientation towards the strongest growth in housing demand markets in the country, the strength of our operating platform with growing efficiencies and the more robust external growth pipeline we have in place that is supported by a sector leading a strong balance sheet, all combined to drive much enthusiasm and confidence in my outlook for MAA over the next few years. As this will serve as my last earnings call prior to the transition of the CEO role, I'd like to extend my appreciation and thanks to our shareholders and to the analyst community for your trust and our company and our team. It's truly been an honor to serve the public capital markets over the past thirty years here at Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Our culture at Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. is grounded in a strong belief that our stewardship of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. assets and shareholder capital is at all times focused on creating value for the benefit of our residents, our shareholders, our associates, and the communities where we operate. I am proud of our associates at Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. I appreciate their hard work and support, and I look forward to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. delivering even higher value in the future for those that we serve. Turn it over to Brad now. You, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As expected, during the fourth quarter, our focus on occupancy combined with higher new supply and the typical seasonal slowdown in leasing traffic weighed on new resident lease pricing during the quarter. But the seasonal decline in lease over lease rates was less than we have seen in previous years. Encouragingly, this pressure has continued to moderate in January, with blended pricing improving more from the fourth quarter's performance than in previous years, predominantly due to improvement in our new lease pricing. I share Eric's optimism for our growth prospects and momentum toward delivering strong long-term earnings. As Tim will discuss in more detail, we are seeing encouraging signs that indicate leasing conditions are poised to support improvement in blended lease rates and have a compounding impact on revenue performance throughout the year. Continued strong absorption, occupancy and exposure, improved seasonal performance, and an expected more meaningful reduction in supply pressure all contribute to a favorable outlook for our existing portfolio. Additionally, we are continuing to invest in several key areas that will significantly impact future earnings, including various technology initiatives that will support our centralization efforts and enhance efficiencies. In 2025, we will begin to more aggressively roll out property-wide Wi-Fi across our portfolio, and we will ramp up the rollout over the next couple of years as a number of our properties transition off of our legacy bulk Wi-Fi program. We also plan to increase our investments in the interior renovation and repositioning programs, both of which benefit from the higher-priced new supply that has delivered into the market recently. On the external growth front, we are committed to maintaining an active development pipeline of around $1 billion. In 2024, we invested in a record five projects expected to deliver average NOI yields stabilization of 6.3%. Ending the year with seven projects under construction representing over 2,300 units at a cost of $850 million. We expect to start construction on another three to four projects in 2025. As the transaction market begins to open later this year, we will continue to opportunistically deploy capital into acquisitions that are in their initial lease-up. During the fourth quarter, we closed on a 386-unit property early in its lease-up in the Dallas market. This property was 44% occupied at the end of the fourth quarter and is expected to stabilize in early 2026. This brings our total acquisitions in 2024 to three properties, which were on average 65% occupied at closing and projected to deliver NOI yields of 5.9% upon reaching stabilization in 2025 and 2026. During the fourth quarter, we sold two properties with an average age of 29 years: a 216-unit property in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a 272-unit property in Richmond, Virginia, delivering a combined investment period IRR of approximately 19%. We have two additional properties in Columbia, South Carolina under contract and expect those to close in the first quarter of 2025. We will continue our focus on strengthening our overall earnings quality by recycling capital out of some of our older higher CapEx properties and redeploying that capital into newer with a higher earnings growth profile, particularly on an after CapEx basis. We expect to execute on the balance of our $325 million disposition plan late in the year. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had eight communities in lease-up, four acquisitions, and four developments, with an end-of-the-year occupancy of 69.7%. We expect the acquisitions to average NOI yields at stabilization of 5.9% and the developments to average NOI yields of around 6.4%. Due to the high level of competition in many of our markets, and our intent to hold firm on our rent pricing expectations, we pushed the expected stabilization dates back slightly on a few of our lease-up properties by one quarter. However, rents continue to exceed our pro forma expectations and are significantly above our original expectations. Our existing portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from the improving demand and supply trends with our various growth initiatives providing additional earnings over the recovery cycle. To all of our associates at the properties and our corporate and regional offices, thank you for your commitment, hard work, and dedication that you show every day to our prospects, residents, and fellow associates. Before turning the call over to Tim, I do want to take a moment to say a few words in recognition of Eric ahead of his transition to the executive chairman role. Over his thirty years of service to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc., with twenty-three years as our chief executive officer, Eric has been instrumental in so many ways to this company. His dedication to serving our various stakeholders is second to none. We are grateful for his vision, wisdom, courage, and discipline in leading this company to unmatched performance. His mentorship and counsel over the years to so many in the industry, and especially to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.'s executive leadership team, and to me exemplify the tremendous leader that he is. Eric, for all you have given to our company and to the industry, we thank you. With that, I will turn the call over to Tim.
Tim Argo: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As noted by Brad, in the fourth quarter, we prioritized achieving portfolio-level occupancy that positions us well for the improving supply-demand dynamic in 2025. We particularly focused on the higher exposure markets, which came at the expense of slightly weaker new lease pricing performance but achieved the occupancy goals for which we were striving. The moderation in new lease pricing showed less seasonal deceleration than we saw in 2023 and less than we typically see from the third to fourth quarter. As a result of this strategy, new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis for the fourth quarter was down 8%, a 260 basis point decline from the third quarter but favorably comparable to a 470 basis point decline over the same period in 2023. Renewal rates for the quarter stayed strong, growing 4.2% on a lease-over-lease basis, which was a 10 basis point increase sequentially over the third quarter. The resulting lease-over-lease pricing on a blended basis was down 2%, which represented a 140 basis point improvement in sequential moderation as compared to the same period in 2023. Average physical occupancy was 95.6%, up 10 basis points from the third quarter. And collections continued to outperform expectations with net delinquency representing just 0.3% of billed rents. All these factors drove the resulting same-store revenue down 0.2% for the quarter and up 0.5% for the full year of 2024. As was true for most of 2024, several of our mid-tier markets continued to hold up better than the broader portfolio in the fourth quarter from a blended lease and release pricing standpoint. Richmond, Norfolk, Charleston, Greenville, and our Frederick and other Northern Virginia properties all stood out. Tampa and Orlando are two larger markets that started to show some relative pricing recovery. Also, as was true for most of 2024, Austin, Atlanta, and Jacksonville are markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the absolute level of supply being delivered into those markets, with Austin continuing to be the toughest challenge of all the markets. We continued our various redevelopment and repositioning initiatives in the fourth quarter. And as Brad mentioned earlier, we expect to accelerate these programs over the course of 2025 and into 2026. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we completed 1,130 interior unit upgrades, bringing our year-to-date total to 5,665 units, achieving rent increases of $106 above non-upgraded units. Despite this more competitive supply environment, these units lease about ten days quicker on average than a non-renovated unit when adjusted for the additional turn time. We expect to renovate closer to 6,000 units in 2025 with an even larger increase expected in 2026. For our repositioning program, we have two active projects that are most of the way through the repricing phase with NOI yields approaching 10%. We have an additional six projects underway with a plan to complete construction between April and June and begin repricing in what we believe will be a strengthening leasing environment. We are also now live on the four property-wide Wi-Fi retrofit projects we began in 2024 and expect to begin an additional 23 projects in 2025. January wrapped up, we are seeing encouraging trends that are aligned with our outlooks for 2025. New lease and blended pricing in January improved as compared to both December and the full fourth quarter with stable occupancy of 95.6%. Our 60-day exposure at the end of January was 7%, 70 basis points lower than this time last year. And should serve to keep occupancy stable through the remainder of the quarter that allows for more pricing power as seasonal demand starts to increase. The 95.6% January average daily physical occupancy was 25 basis points higher than January of 2024. As Brad noted, absorption remains strong in our markets with the fourth quarter representing the second consecutive quarter that units absorbed exceeded units delivered. The excess absorption as compared to new supply in the fourth quarter was the largest gap since the third quarter of 2021. With new lease pricing improving, the remaining challenge we are also encouraged by the lease-over-lease rates achieved non-acceptive renewals through April with the average increases in the 4.25% range. Improving new lease rates should help support continued strong renewal performance into the busier spring and summer leasing season. New supply deliveries continue to be a headwind in many of our markets, but the trends support expected improvement throughout 2025, laying the groundwork for an even stronger 2026. Following on Eric's comments with construction start peaking in mid to late 2022 in most of our markets, we believe we have passed the maximum pricing pressure period of ten to come two years or so after the peak of construction. The slowly moderating supply pressure, increasing spring and summer leasing traffic, and our current occupancy exposure portfolio position have us excited about the recovery to come. That is all the way I have in prepared comments. We will now turn the call over to Clay.
Clay Holder: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.23 per share, was in line with our fourth quarter guidance and contributed to core FFO for the full year of $8.88 per share, in line with our original guidance for the year. Our same-store revenue results for the quarter were relatively in line with expectations. As Tim mentioned, same-store revenues benefited from strong. Our same-store expense performance was slightly unfavorable compared to our guidance due to personnel costs and other property expenses. Favorable interest expense and non-operating income offset the increase in same-store expenses. During the quarter, we funded approximately $64 million of development costs of the current $852 million pipeline leaving an expected $374 million to be funded on our current pipeline, over the next two to three years. We also invested approximately $18 billion of capital through our redevelopment and repositioning programs during the quarter, which we expect to continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio and produce solid returns upon completion. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We ended the quarter with over $1 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity, under our revolving credit facility. Providing significant opportunity to fund future investments. Our leverage remains low with net debt to EBITDA at four times, and at quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 95% fixed at an effective rate of 3.8%. During December, we issued $350 million of ten-year public bonds at an effective rate of just over 5% using proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper. These proceeds provide an accretive use of capital given the expected stabilized NOI yield approaching 6% or greater on our recent acquisitions and current developments that Brad previously mentioned. Finally, we provided initial earnings guidance for 2025 with our release, which is detailed in the supplemental information package. FFO for 2025 is projected to be at $8.61 to $8.93, or $8.77 at the midpoint. As has been outlined in the prior comments, expect the momentum in rental pricing to grow over the course of the year and to drive improving year-over-year performance in core FFO over the back half of the year. The proposed 2025 same-store revenue growth midpoint of 0.4% results from a rental pricing earn-in of negative 0.4% combined with a blended rental pricing expectation of 1.7% for the year. We expect blended rental pricing to be comprised of new lease pricing, will continue to be impacted by elevated supply levels and renewal pricing in line with historical levels. We expect the impact of these elevated supply levels to improve over the course of the year. The same-store portfolio, we expect effective rent growth for the year to be approximately 0.2% at the midpoint of our range. Occupancy to average between 95.3% and 95.9% for the year or 95.6% at the midpoint and other revenue items primarily reimbursement and fee income to grow at 2.5%. Same-store operating expenses are projected to grow at a midpoint of 3.2% for the year, personnel and repair and maintenance costs are expected to grow just over 3% we will expect some continued pressure from marketing costs and insurance expense. These expense projections combined with the revenue growth of 0.4% results in a projected decline in same-store NOI of 1.15% at the midpoint. We currently have non-communities actively leasing and an additional community stabilized in late 2024. Given the interest carry and leasing velocity of these recently acquired and completed developments, we anticipate our lease-up pipeline being slightly diluted to core FFO in the first half of the year before turning accretive later in the year as more projects stabilize contributing about $0.03 to core FFO for the year, net of the interest carry. We expect continued external growth in 2025, both through acquisitions and development. We anticipate a range of $350 million to $450 million in acquisitions, all likely to be in lease-up and not yet stabilized. And a range of $250 million to $350 million in development investments for the year. This growth was partially funded by asset sales, we expect dispositions of approximately $325 million with the remainder to be funded by debt financing and internal cash flow. This external growth is expected to be slightly diluted to core FFO in 2025 and then turn accretive to core FFO after stabilization. We project total overhead expenses, a combination of property management expenses, and G&A expenses to be $134.5 million at the midpoint, a 4.5% increase over 2024 results. We also expect to refinance $100 million on bonds maturing in November 2025. These bonds have an effective rate of 4.2% and we are forecasting to refinance at 5%. Anticipated refinancing coupled with our 2024 refinancing activities, will result in $0.03 dilution to core FFO as compared to the prior year. Combined with financing to support our expected growth for 2025, we project interest expense to increase by approximately 13% for the year. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. Eun, we will now turn the call back to you for any questions. Thank you. Once again, we will now open the call up for questions. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your touch-tone phone. If you would like to withdraw your question, you may press the pound key. Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thanks for taking the question.
Tim Argo: I was hoping you could put a finer point on the 1.7% blend outlook for 2025. Can you talk exactly about what you are thinking for new versus renewal? And then is there a point in the year where you think new spreads actually turn positive? Maybe talk a little bit more about the cadence throughout the year of that 1.7%.
Tim Argo: Yeah. This is Tim. I will give a little bit of detail on the guidance, the pricing guidance. So for the year, we are expecting new lease pricing at a lease-over-lease basis somewhere in the negative 1.5% range with that obviously playing out seasonally with the lowest point where we are right now getting slightly positive as we get into Q3 and then start to trend back down seasonally a little bit as we get into Q4. And then renewals, pretty steady in that 4.25% to 4.5% range where we are right now. We do not expect much movement there. That tends to stay pretty consistent. So it is the new lease pricing that drives the variance throughout the quarters.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. I am sorry. Did you do you think you will see any months or quarters with positive new lease?
Tim Argo: Yeah. I would say as you get into you know, typically what we see if you think about normal seasonality is new lease pricing sort of accelerating January through to about July and then starting to moderate as we get into August. So I would expect as we get into late Q2, early Q3, we will we expect to have two or three months where we will be slightly positive on the new lease rate and then trend back down to negative as you get in the late Q3 and then the Q4.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. And then what are you guys thinking on turnover? How does that trend throughout the year?
Tim Argo: Expecting pretty consistent with where we were in 2024. You know, the major reasons people move out obviously buy a home job change, those are the buy home is down. Think, 20% in Q4 compared to where it was last year with interest rates and home prices where they are. We do not expect that to move a lot. And so we in generally, we are dialing into our forecast renewal or turnover consistent with where we were in 2024.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. And, Eric, congratulations again. Thank you.
Eric Wolfe: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Your line is open.
Eric Wolfe: Hey. I just wanted to follow-up there. I mean, I when I look at the contribution to your same-store revenue from the 1.7% blend, it looks like it is sort of on the lower end, which suggests that there is probably a good back half waiting to the blended spread. So I was just curious if that is the case. If you could just maybe provide, like, you know, you expect first half to be in, like, a half percent range, and then it is a step up to over 2.5%. Or if the difference is really just seasonally, like, you just think that seasonally the second quarter and third quarter will be sort of a very normal lift. I am just trying to understand if this is, like, a sort of back half type of prediction for this year.
Tim Argo: Not necessarily a back half prediction. I mean, we expect the normal seasonality as I was talking about and certainly for new lease rates to moderate as you get late Q3 and into Q4. So it is really and, you know, other thing keep in mind, obviously, when you when you think about mid Q2, early Q3, we also have the bulk of our leases expiring during that time. So matching up some of the more positive new lease rates with the maximum number of lease is really what drives that waiting. But as I mentioned, you know, expect to get because slightly positive call to the one to one and a quarter range for a couple months. In the in the middle of the year and then start to trend back down. So it is the combination of the waiting of the lease expiration, then obviously the balance between new lease and renewals. We expect renewals will Yeah. Heavier weighting as they were this year with consistent turnover, so that is really what is driving the full year number. Eric, this is this is Brad. I will just I will I will add one one additional item to that. You know, certainly, if you look at the supply and the new deliveries as we get into this year, I mean, as we look back, the new supply that was started in 2023, clearly, there was a drop off in that new supply in the back half of 2023, which we think you know, really informs the supply pressure as we get into 2025. So, you know, as we mentioned in our comments, you know, we are in still an elevated level of supply. Today, we are off the peak of where we have been in in 2024. And that supply picture will continue to get better as we go throughout this year. So to Tim's point, as you as you start layering on top of diminishing supply pressure environment as we go through the year with, you know, the demand that continues to pick up as we get into spring and summer leasing season. That really, starts to inform the trajectory of what we think the lease rates will look like through the year.
Eric Wolfe: Got it. That is helpful. I am not sure if you have this data, but one you look at your renewals, what percent of those renewals are also tenants that renewed the prior year? Guess I am trying to understand sort of what percentage of tenants are taking two years of this sort of 4% to 5% renewal increases and sort of a flattish market rate environment. And if you have any sort of limit on where renewal rate rents can be relative to market or new lease rents.
Tim Argo: Well, another way to perhaps characterize that is our average stay is somewhere in the 21, 22-month range. That certainly has extended out a little bit over the last couple of years with the lower turnover. So, you know, typically, you have a resident moves in has called a 12-month lease, and then does one renewal, and then on average, they are moving out after that first renewal. So typically do not see renewal on top of renewal on top of renewal, which which tends to be a little bit of a gutter on on that gap getting too too wide. Even with lower turnover, we are still, you know, turning you know, a good chunk of the portfolio every year. And so it tends to balance itself out a little bit. And then to Brad's point about strengthening supply-demand dynamic, we expect new lease rates to accelerate throughout the year, which then should in turn help the renewal rates where it is starting to narrow that gap and it does not does not gap any wider than it has been through thick metal. Provide some stability and strength on the renewal side also.
Eric Wolfe: Got it.
Nick Yulico: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Good morning, everyone. It is Dan Tricarico. I am with Nick. Can you help us understand how concessions in your markets have impacted your new lease rate figures and, you know, if you see the dissipation of concessionary activity and these are comps maybe having a you know, choose your to use your word, compounding effect on the on the reported numbers.
Tim Argo: Yeah. I mean, to to answer the last part of that, I mean, the lease-over-lease rates we quote are net of the impact of concessions, so that is considered in there. But I would say broadly, you know, for us, for our portfolio, concessions were down a little bit in Q4 as compared to Q3 in terms of cash concessions. I would say at a market-wide portfolio level, concessions were pretty consistent. Around a month free is pretty typical in most markets. Now you get into some of the tougher markets with with a lot of lease-up, and it is some of the same submarkets I have talked about before, anything about downtown Austin and then Round Rock, Georgetown area of Austin. You think about Midtown Atlanta. You think about Uptown Charlotte. That is where you can get more into the two, two and a half even up to three in a couple spots with a lot of lease-up. So still pressure there, some of the markets we have talked about, but the concession pressure overall is steady to perhaps slightly declining.
Nick Yulico: Great. Thanks for that. And then I guess as a follow-up, do you have a sense on, I guess, how much competitive supply that you guys track is how much that is declining year over year in 2026 and 2027 and you know, maybe how that compares on a, like, a completions as a percent of stock basis to know, maybe the prior years to 2020.
Tim Argo: Yeah. I mean, for 2025, we think supply is probably down 15% to 20% in terms of just absolute units. Being delivered from from 2024 to 2025. It is we think it is down closer 30% to 40% as you look out into 2026. And then, you know, you start getting pretty far out at that point. But if you look at the starts and Eric hit on this as well, I mean, starts are down. Q4 of 2024 starts in our market were 0.3% of inventory, which is the lowest it has been, you know, for the last several years, well below where it was even during COVID. So it speaks to a pretty pretty long window where we think supply will be moderating.
Nick Yulico: But, like, on a on a completions as a percent of stock, like, in 2026, is that like, lower than a normal Yeah.
Tim Argo: Yeah. I would say, you know, in our markets, 3.5% of inventory is probably about average. You know, if you if you about the long term, 3.5%, we have probably been above that. The last few years, but I think 2025 or 2026 is below that, and I expect 2027 is even further below that.
Nick Yulico: Right. Thanks, and congratulations, our
Brad Heffern: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Yeah. Thanks. Morning, everyone. You have talked a few times about the start of the year being better than normal. I think you said in the prepared remarks blends are improving more than normal in January on a a sequential basis. Those are obviously very influenced by comp. So I am just curious if you are seeing, like, a real market level fundamental influx inflection, market rent trend being better than normal, occupancy rising, You kinda talked about concessions maybe getting a little bit better. Just trying to figure out how much of that is is sort of just comps and the abnormality of where leasing spreads are right now versus like, a a real fundamental change?
Tim Argo: Well, I mean, it is a it is a combination of all of those. Certainly, the lessening supply, I think, is playing a part of that. You know, easier comps, if you will, is playing a part of that. But, you know, when we when we think about the sequential trends we are seeing in January both compared to December and Q4. And not just looking back to the last year or two, but looking back to you know, what we would call more normal periods probably is going back to 2017, 2018, 2019. The deceleration from Q3 and Q4 was sort of less than typical and then the acceleration from from Q4 to January was more so. And so much where, you know, January new lease pricing is better than the than the full Q4, which is pretty atypical. We usually see it. It is usually a little bit lower than Q4. Then we would expect February, March to accelerate even more. So feel like it is a good position to where we are and and showing some, I think, growth strength in the recovery. So I think that piece is probably tied to just an improving overall outlook, the higher than typical acceleration. Okay. Thanks for that.
Brad Heffern: And then can you talk through whether you think changes in immigration policy could have a significant impact on the portfolio either through you know, deportations or just through less immigration.
Brad Hill: Yeah. Hey. This is Brad. You know, I would say, you know, from the same store, perspective, you know, we we do not see a whole lot of impact coming from from a change in the immigration policies. I mean, there is nothing that we tracked that would indicate that we are, you know, really overly sick fix exposed to to any type of of the immigration issues that that we see out there. So, you know, from a labor perspective in our same store portfolio, we we do not see that being a big impact in terms from a resident perspective again, you know, what no matter which metric we are looking at, we do not see that we are exposed to a large degree to that. Now having said that, where I think we could see some impact associated with the the immigration side would be on, you know, perhaps in the new development area, where, you know, a lot of the labor in that area there could be some labor impact associated with that. And you know, clearly, that would have a an impact on the ability of the market really to ramp up new construction, you know, for us. You know, obviously, that that would impact our desire to continue to hold our new developments you know, at the billion-dollar level that we are talking about. But but given the overall size of our existing portfolio, you know, anything that that slows down supply longer term would be a benefit to our existing portfolio. But you know, at this point, it is it is something that we will have to continue to monitor and see how it how it plays out, but we are not seeing a material impact. We do not see that on the horizon at the moment. Okay. Thanks for the thought.
Jeff Spector: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Jeff Spector: Great. Thank you. Just to follow-up to that, I I was gonna ask a similar question, but maybe even just pulling in demographics. When you think about your portfolio positioning, third a, third b plus, third b, and then split between urban, suburban. I guess from a high level, long-term standpoint, five-year view. Does any of this change your thinking on portfolio positioning?
Brad Hill: This is Brad. Tim, you can add some points here too. But, you know, I do not I do not think so. I mean, you know, one of the one of the characteristics of our portfolio long term is is definitely to orient our portfolio toward the highest demand region of the country, you know, that that generally leads to lower volatility in both earnings and dividends performance. And so we think that that continues to be the right focus for us in terms of where we are located, the market we are located in, you know, and also allocating capital mix between, you know, larger markets and mid-tier markets. So you know, that also tends to support kind of a more affordable price point than, you know, other portfolios that are out there. And I think you know, if you look at our return over a long period of time, I think I think that speaks to, you know, us appealing to the broadest segment of the rental market. And I think, ultimately, that is really what we want to do versus skewing the portfolio to one end of the spectrum versus the other. And so I do not see a material change in terms of our strategy, in terms of how we are allocating capital or those other portfolio characteristics that we target.
Jeff Spector: Great. Thank you. And then I apologize if I missed this but can you talk a little bit more, disclose more on on cap rates? Between the acquisitions, dispositions and maybe what the requirement is today between you know, what you are looking for between development and acquisitions. Thank you.
Brad Hill: Hey, Jeff. This is Brad again. Yeah. So the dispositions that we have sold in the fourth quarter, cap rates on those were call it, low sixes. And and those I will tell you on the two that we sold, we had one property in in Charlotte that did have a fire during the marketing process. So, you know, proceeds were certainly impacted a bit by that. So, you know but but all my I will tell you on an after CapEx basis, you know, the those properties that we are selling generally are thirty-year-old assets, so they have higher CapEx needs that we are recycling the capital out of. And then we are redeploying that capital, as I mentioned in my my call comments, into acquisitions, generally in lease-up. So there is some lease-up period associated with them. And then upon reaching stabilization, those yields are close to 6% in terms of what we are achieving. Now we are able to achieve those yields, you know, because we are focused on properties that are in lease-up that are harder for the market to finance. So we are able to get better pricing. Generally, we are 15% to 20% below current replacement costs on those. So we are able to get a a pretty good return on those. The market cap rates in the the fourth quarter that we tracked is not a lot of data points. We we only track six projects that ended up closing in the cap rate was around a 5.51. Our developments, the five that that we invested in and 2024, those were a six called a 6.4 NOI yield. So it is a it is a 140 basis point spread to current market cap rates. And we feel that that is a good place for us to continue to focus our capital, you know, in that six to six and a half range on development.
Jeff Spector: Thank you.
Austin Wurschmidt: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt. KeyBanc Capital Markets. Line is opened.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks, and good morning, everybody. So going back to a question earlier about lease-over-lease pricing expectations and just kind of thinking back to when you started to see pricing pressure the back half of 2023 and and kind of this expectation that absorption of peak deliveries will will continue through the first half of this year. Is it fair to assume that you you do face easier comps in the back half of the year you could see concession pricing begin to abate more quickly, which could lead to kind of the the even better spread and blended rate growth versus the prior year, that will lead to, you know, the acceleration of net year-over-year net effective rent growth. Is that is that the right way to think about it?
Tim Argo: Hey, Austin. This is Sam. And are you talking about as we get to the back part of 2025, primarily? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I definitely think we could see, if you want to call it less season seasonality as you get into late 2025 because we as we talked about, we have got the moderating supply pressure that will continue to So Speak well on the demand side through the remainder of 2025 and into 2026. We did see kind of a peak of that supply pressure late 2024. So, yeah, I think there is a there is an easier comp component that comes with that. Square, I would expect, you know, we are talking about this less seasonal deceleration that we saw this year. I think we could definitely see that in the back part of 2025 as well.
Austin Wurschmidt: And based on the fact that you did negative half a percent year-over-year net effective rent growth in the back half of 2024, and the guidance assumes a 20 basis point positive growth this year. I guess, when do you expect that net effect effective to turn positive on a year-over-year basis? Yeah. I will say it will you know, it will probably be by towards the the middle part of the year by in Q3 mid Q3, and then and then on into Q4 and beyond. That is helpful. And then just last one for me. If you broke out your blended rate growth between the larger markets and your smaller secondary markets, how do those stack up, you know, relative to, you know, this year versus 2024? Just curious where you are seeing the most improvement between those two buckets. And that is all for me. Thank you.
Tim Argo: I mean, I would say we have seen it seeing seeing that gap narrow a little bit. I mean, the secondary markets or mid-tier, however you want to call it, have outperformed certainly the last couple of years with generally lower supply having in those markets. But we we have seen a start to an era, particularly in the last couple of quarters. There is still probably 50 basis points. I would call it a pricing difference, but it it has narrowed a bit.
Michael Goldsmith: Next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith. With UBS. Line is opened.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. The question is on on the return of pricing power. Your your occupancy levels are elevated, but not do you see pricing power returning contingent on occupancy to improve in competing properties and does the slowdown in supplier growth that that you are expecting this year support that?
Tim Argo: Well, certainly, the market level I can see plays into it a little bit. You know, you are somewhat at the mercy of what some of your other immediate comps are doing. But when we look at where our current occupancy is right now, which is 25 to 30 basis points better than it was this time last year and really looking at exposure, which looks out further and we are in a much better position there. You know, we are pretty confident that certainly over the next few months, in a good good spot with occupancy to where, you know, we can particularly get into the spring, you can start to push on that pricing. But given where we are right now with exposure compared to last year, that is a better spot to be. And then you you combine that with declining supply, gives us pretty good confidence that occupancy will stay in the steady range, which is which is about where we want it. We do not really desire to be at 96%. Somewhere in this 95.6% range is about right and where we can start to push on price as we get into the spring and summer.
Michael Goldsmith: Got it. And just as a as a follow-up, as you think about new lease rents and and how they will trend through this year, you are going from you know, down 8% today to positive in the third quarter. So what does that new lease rent look like from the start of the year to week and and how does that maybe compare to historical growth through the year? Thanks.
Tim Argo: So our our January new lease rates were negative 7.1%. So that is kind of where we are starting. And, you know, as we talked about, every year that we have seen sort of normal seasonality, we see that accelerate pretty consistently through to about July. So as I mentioned, as we get to the July, we are thinking slightly positive somewhere in the one one and a half percent range. So you can kind of do the math on the acceleration that that we are assuming. But that is typical with kind of how the seasonality typically works.
Michael Goldsmith: How does that compare to, like, historically? Like, the historical year or the historical curve?
Tim Argo: It is certainly historical. It is a historical curve, so the shape of the curve would look like normal. It is a little bit steeper as you get into the spring and summer based on seasonality combined with declining supply pressure.
Michael Goldsmith: Got it. Thank you very much.
Adam Kramer: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for for taking the question. Congrats, Erica. All the best going forward. Wanted to ask about the kind of job growth and wage growth assumptions and maybe even just kind of higher higher level macro assumptions that you know, you have you have embedded, I guess, either formally or or informally kind of in in the guide here.
Tim Argo: Yeah. I would say from a, you know, macroeconomic standpoint, pretty consistent with what we saw in 2024. So we are expecting, you know, call it 600,000 new jobs at our markets for 2025, which would be consistent with what we saw in 2024, pretty consistent in terms of you know, the in-migration that we continue to see, household formation, population growth, all the various factors that that you have seen, we would expect to stay pretty consistent and and certainly be above what we see at the national level with these markets being a little bit higher gross markets. And then combined with that, continued low turnover, continue to load move outs to to buy a home and and some of the other reasons. So, you know, macroeconomic pretty consistent with last year, but with a better supply dynamic. Great. That is really helpful. And I I think you just mentioned the January new lease number in in the prior question or answer, but do you mind just giving the the kind of renewal and blended number for January as well? Yeah. So January, new lease, negative 7.1%. Renewal was 4.6%. And blend was negative 0.9%.
Adam Kramer: Got it. Appreciate the time, guys. Thank you.
Alexander Goldfarb: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb. With Piper Sandler. Your line is opened. Good morning morning morning down there. And Eric, as I say in in New York, and, Brad, you know that the buck now stops with you. So all the complaining all the complaining and griping now comes to your desk. Two questions. First, as you guys look at know, cap rates, you mentioned 5.51, I think, to Jeff Spector's question. You know, debt costs are certainly above that. How long do you think people because not everyone could be an all-cash buyer. So what is your sense for how long people are tolerating that negative leverage. And is that and do you think it is typical with what we you have seen historically when we have periods of negative leverage or do you think people are willing to wait longer?
Brad Hill: I mean, this is Brad. I think, you know, historically, periods of negative leverage have been temporary. I would say this is probably been one of the longest periods of negative leverage that that has occurred. And so what we are seeing a couple of things. One is you know, buyers are are buying down their interest rates a bit, which helps the negative leverage sum. And then two, I think I think they are underwriting an assumption of a pretty aggressive recovery in 2026 and beyond. And I think that that certainly helps them get more comfortable with what their negative leverage looks like and how quickly they can grow out of that position. So I think it really depends on what your outlook is and how aggressive you are going to be on the on the underwriting. But those are two things that we are we are certainly seeing in the market right now.
Alexander Goldfarb: And then as you guys underwrite project whether they are acquisitions or developments, how much of your how much of the math is coming from other income, meaning WiFi or cell service or waste or other services, meaning, like, years ago it was pure rent. But the industry has evolved. So I am just sort of curious. How much of your yield now comes from things other than rent?
Brad Hill: You know, it is it is not much. I mean, we certainly, the the one piece that I think would be probably a bigger component will be with the WiFi piece, with which, you know, we are just now rolling out across the portfolio. You know, that that is one that that certainly has positive implications from a resident experience perspective. And you know, and from a demand perspective from our residents as well as supporting, you know, what we are doing on self-touring and things of that nature. But you know, we we have gotten away. You know, we have some properties with valet trash and things of that nature. But, generally, you know, those are not you know, major items that we are focusing efforts on. It is really in areas where, you know, we are adding value to our residents. Whether it is our bulk cable that we have or our WiFi. Certainly, those are are some of the larger components of the the fees that we do have.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Richard Anderson: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Anderson with Wedbush. Your line is open. Thanks. Good morning. And yeah. Eric, if this is an April fools joke, it will be the best one ever. But really really really an honor to to follow your career, to this point, and good luck to you. But I I am gonna ask you a question because, you know, I am not letting you get off the hook. As executive chairman, we have heard that, you know, title before, and and sometimes people have difficulty disengaging. I I and then you said you are gonna remain active, which is great, I think, for everybody involved. But how do you think the dynamic will play out? You know, is Brad, like, on day one his fingerprints are gonna be all over? Or is there gonna be sort of a a phase-in process? I am I am just wondering, you know, when you say remain active, is that like a a dimmer switch as time passes? Or a light switch? I am just I just want to know. How things will go from here.
Eric Bolton: Well, like your analogy, Rich, about the the switches. I would I would definitely definitely lean towards the dimmer switch concept. And that is the intent here. I as I have said earlier, I have got tremendous confidence in Brad and tremendous confidence in the team that he has with him. And I think just as a function of me pulling back a little bit that the the the influence that that Brad and the rest of the team have on performance and and how things are playing out is gonna grow. And my influence will diminish. But I think that the the the intent here is for me to continue to be actively available to to Brad to help him think about, you know, whatever may be coming up in terms of challenges or opportunities. And I certainly will remain tied into man you know, the the repairs for finger on the pulse so that I can I can be helpful in that regard as well? But but but it clearly is, you know, an intention here as I have seen it done successfully in other organizations. For my you know, sort of involvement to diminish over time, and that is and that is that is the plan. And and and, you know, certainly remain active at the board level for years to come. I have got you know, I have been here for thirty years, and everything I have personally is tied up in the company. I I I cannot think of a better investment for my net worth and plan to, you know, continue to do all our Kansas support, making it worth more in the future.
Richard Anderson: Awesome. Thanks for that, Eric, and good luck. My second question real quick is, you know, when we have seen extraordinary conditions play out, it is often followed by extraordinary snapbacks. Like, for example, the twenty plus percent type growth we were seeing in rents when people moved back to the old you know, office and so on in 2022, I guess it was. So we have had extraordinary supply in the Sunbelt. You are talking about a path of improvement as the year progresses. How excited are you really for 2026? And and is there a chance where like, significantly outsized growth starting in 2026 just because of the nature of the events that took place that seated at I am just curious if that is a possibility in your eyes.
Eric Bolton: I mean, I definitely think it is a possibility, Rich, because as you say, you and I both have been around a long time and and the severity of the cycle tends to define the the the extent of the recovery. And we are coming off a fifty-year high level of supply in our markets. I mean, this is this is unprecedented. We have not seen this level of supply since we have been a public company. And I what is what is so encouraging about that fact is the is the fact that, you know, you know, our our NOI and our overall performance moderated certainly from where we were during the COVID years, but it did not collapse by any means. And, it is held up actually pretty darn well. In in in in the grand scheme of things. And, and I think that speaks to just the appeal of this product, the appeal of our markets, the appeal of our portfolio. And all those factors that drive the appeal, that drive demand are still there and I think are growing. I think the the new incoming administration is more likely to have a positive impact ultimately on the economy than the negative. At least, I certainly hope that. So I am very enthused about what I continue to believe is gonna be, you know, great demand side dynamics. I against a backdrop of what we know is gonna be incredibly dramatic falloff in the level of supply coming into the market. And so that does set up a very interesting, you know, set of demand supply dynamics going into late this year into 2026 and 2027. That we think is going to have a hugely positive impact on on our performance.
Richard Anderson: Okay. Great. Thanks very much, and Thank you again, Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thank you, Rich. Appreciate it.
Steve Sakwa: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is opened.
Steve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked. I just wanted to maybe ask Clay one on just the refinancing of of the bonds. You know, I think you threw out a 5% rate I guess I am really curious. Where do you think your spreads are today? I realized ten year is pretty volatile. So trying to peg it to an exact way today might be hard. But, you know, where do you think ten year issue would be for you today with tenure sitting around a little over four forty.
Clay Holder: Yeah. Save, you know, back in in December, we actually issued some bonds and and actually got a a record record lows spread of of seventy-eight basis points with that transaction. Given where where the treasury has has trended since that point in time, you know, I suspect that spread has probably ticked up, you know, several base points, but I would still say it is somewhere between eighty and eighty-five bps.
Steve Sakwa: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Michael Gorman: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Gorman with BTIG. Line is opened.
Michael Gorman: Yeah. Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. Going back to the transaction side of things, just trying to understand how we should think about the potential timing of investments over the course of the year. If I kind of marry it up to your discussions of the fundamental strengths kind of improving in the markets, your focus on lease-up properties should we expect acquisition opportunities maybe to be front-end loaded before maybe some of that lease-up opportunity hits and maybe more competition comes into the space? Or or how should we think about that?
Brad Hill: Yeah. I mean, you know, just based on, you know, what we are seeing in the market right now and, you know, what we heard last week at NME. You know, my sense is that the market is probably gonna be slower the first half of the year and will likely tick up, you know, maybe midyear and then into the third quarter. And, you know, obviously, you know, as those those properties come out, and hit the market, you know, it takes, you know, ninety to a hundred and twenty days, you know, for some of these to close. So you know, my sense is it is gonna be third quarter before we really start to see the volume pick up on the transaction side.
Michael Gorman: Okay. Great. That is helpful. And then maybe just one last one. I apologize if I missed it, but you mentioned outperforming on the collections front. What what do you have baked into the 2025 guidance in terms of delinquencies?
Tim Argo: Yeah. We it is pretty consistent with what we have seen, this this past year. So I think we have got about thirty basis points, thirty-five basis points are showing for for delinquencies and and and the 2025 guide.
Michael Gorman: Great. Thanks so much.
Haendel St. Juste: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Haendel St. Juste: Yes. Good morning, and, Erica, GolfClap. It has been a pleasure I had a couple quick questions I wanted to first, a follow-up. I think it was Michael question earlier. I am curious how much actual rents would need to change over the course of this year for new lease rates to be positive. Not just how much new lease spreads we need to improve, but the actual dollar per unit change from now until third quarter and then maybe some context on what that would perhaps look like in a more normal year. Thanks.
Tim Argo: Yeah. And that was Tim. If you think about if I look at January, for example, the all of the new lease absolute rents that we put in place compared to January of last year, it is about a negative one and a half percent spread. And that that gap has continued to narrow throughout 2024. So you will call it twenty-five dollar gap in that year-over-year look. So that can give you a little bit of little bit of perspective on on what that gap looks like. I mean, we we typically would see if you think about market rents as you know, whatever December was and then how it trends on new leases throughout the year. We would see you know, July probably four or five percent above what December rates are and then trend back down. So, you know, something less than that is really what we have dialed in, but that gives you a little bit of perspective.
Haendel St. Juste: Appreciate that. My second question is on the outlook for for turnover this year. I think you guys mentioned flat relative to last year. Last year, I think you had close to I think, almost sixty percent, risk pension, one of the highest levels. I can remember. But I am curious if demand and market great. Start to show some improvement as as we expect and start pushing a bit more for for pricing power. Would not that cause some upward pressure on turnover? So just on how you are thinking about your your expectations for turnover this year.
Tim Argo: Yeah. I mean, certainly, that it does. But, you know, I I would argue right now with all of the options that are out there in the market and all the supply that is out there, I mean, people have more options certainly than they ever have. So, you know, that is there is more incentive, frankly, to to move right now given the concession environment. Environment and all the spot that is out there. And yet we we have not seen that turnover pickup. So I think it is more macro driven. It is, you know, biggest reason to move out is has always been to buy a house, and that is extremely difficult, not only with interest rates, but with where single-family home prices are. Continue to grow even as our our rents have moderated over the last year. So I think it is more of a macro picture in terms of of price style changes and and life events is driving it more so less so than you know, the the current pricing position.
Haendel St. Juste: Appreciate the task. Thanks, guys.
Rich Hightower: Next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Barclays. Your line is open.
Rich Hightower: Hey. Good morning, guys. And again, congrats to both Eric and and Brad. Just one from me. I guess if we are, you know, if you are keeping a steady development pipeline, it sounds like right around a billion, give or take. But if we see this air pocket of sorts in in in new supply going forward where maybe you could lean into development a little more. You know, as as as sort of current projects trail off. What is the appetite, the capacity? Obviously, you have got a great balance sheet. And I assume you could flex that up anytime you like. So just tell us about the thoughts around maybe increasing development from here. Thanks.
Brad Hill: Yeah. I mean, I think, certainly, development is one of the best uses of capital that we have today, and especially given, you know, what we will be a diminished supply pipeline going forward. And you know, it it takes time to really build that pipeline. And and, you know, two years ago that we had that pipeline was at about $450 million and today, it is close to $900 million where we want to keep it. So the team has done a tremendous job of really building it to that point and and I I do think said in his comments and I have mentioned, you know, the starts that we had in 2024 is a record level for us. And so we have really good momentum in terms of building that and and would like to really keep it elevated. You know, today, you know, we expect another three to four projects to start this year, which will keep us at that level where where I think you could potentially see additional opportunities could be in our JV prepurchase platform where we partner with other developers because we are seeing continued instances where equity capital, you know, is backing out of deals and we are able to to step into potential deals that are pretty close to show already. We we have a couple of opportunities we are looking at like that for this year, which could allow us to to quickly add additional projects to that pipeline. So, you know, that is an area we will continue to focus on. You know, we would like to keep, our exposure there no more than about 5% of our enterprise value, which keeps us kind of in that well, we call it $1.2 billion range, something in that area. So we will be to the extent that we are able to lean into that a bit more, we we will.
Rich Hightower: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks.
Rob DelPriore: Our next question comes from the line of Rob DelPriore with Janney. Your line is open.
Rob DelPriore: Rob, you appear to be muted.
Wes Golladay: Okay. We are gonna go ahead and move on. Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Line is opened.
Wes Golladay: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations to both Eric and Brad. Quick question for you on migration to the Sunbelt. Has there been any change in volume or they are coming from?
Tim Argo: Hey, Wes. It is Sam. Not really. I mean, it is it is it is sort of hovered in that ten to twelve to thirteen percent of our move-ins coming from outside of the Sunbelt into the Sunbelt, and that is that is continues to be in that range. And, generally, it is it is obviously the the larger states is where they tend to come from. It is California, New York, and Chicago, and some of those. So broadly, the the the trends are the same as they have been for the last year or so.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then you are doing a lot of asset recycling this year. Is there any appetite to lever up a little early in the cycle?
Tim Argo: Yeah. So we will you will spear price a little bit of that as as we as we, you know, look to acquire. You know, Brad mentioned some of those acquisitions will probably be in the the latter part of the year. What we are the way we are thinking about the case of that, though, is to your point, Wes, is that those dispositions will probably fall off in the in the back part of the year, and so you might see a little bit of lever up to to fund some of the the development pipeline that we talked about and as well as some of the acquisitions that that we have that we have got it towards as well. It would not be anything outside of what we stated as far as where our leverage would go, though.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thank you.
Linda Tsai: Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai.
Linda Tsai: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Eric, congratulations again. You are really paradigm for leadership. You are earning a fifteen negative fifteen to negative fifty. It is based on pricing through October, maybe some more color on that. And how does that compare to a year ago?
Clay Holder: Yeah. So last year, our our earn-in was was a positive fifty basis points. And so as as I mentioned in my my comments, the the earnings we have going into 2025 is is negative forty basis points. If you are alluding to our our NAREIT presentation that we had provided back in November. You know, the difference the midpoint of that was obviously thirty-five basis points, negative thirty-five basis points. So we did see a little bit of pressure in November and December in in in pricing, that that bar from that midpoint down to to the negative forty basis points.
Linda Tsai: And then the steep drop in supply pressure in markets know, over down twenty percent like Houston, Atlanta, Orlando, is that supply coming down at the same time collectively? Or is it sort of bumpy?
Tim Argo: It is it is relatively consistent when you think about it across markets. It is huge. If you go back to the starts that we talked about, the kind of peaks and second quarter, third quarter of 2022, there is a couple markets where that peak was a quarter earlier or a quarter later, but for the most part, it was riding that range. So I would expect a relatively steady decline. It is it is pretty consistent across most markets. I mean, certainly, there is a few that are still seeing increasing supply, but on on balance, it is pretty consistent trend.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Ann Chan: Our next question comes from the line of Ann Chan with Green Street. Your line is open.
Ann Chan: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So first question, going to the topic of portfolio allocation, over the next few years, do you expect to exit any markets or enter any new markets? And if so, which markets are on your shortlist?
Brad Hill: Diane, this is Brad. I mean, we we definitely have some markets where we have one or two assets that over time will continue to cycle out of and drive efficiencies. I mean, broadly speaking, we we like our overall portfolio allocation where we are located in the split between, you know, kind of our larger markets and our mid-tier markets. So you know, certainly not looking to do any type of a large repositioning of the portfolio, but some of those markets where we have one or two assets will certainly look to to call out of overtime. And, you know, in terms of other markets, I mean, we do have newer markets for us that we need to continue to grow in. You know, Denver, we have got a a pretty big development pipeline there where we continue to add assets and grow to that market, which is a newer market for us, Salt Lake City. Is another one where we need to continue to grow and fill out in. And and we are looking at newer markets that, you know, that have some of the same characteristics of our our high growth markets and you know, Columbus, Ohio is is certainly a mark market that that we have studied and are looking at, and and so we will see. It has a lot of the similar characteristics as our other markets. In terms of job growth and things of that nature.
Ann Chan: Thanks. And for second question, shifting over to developments and construction costs. Have you observed any changing trends in construction costs components, like, labor or material costs that are over the last few months? And, you know, to the extent that it drives the bottom decisions, where where would you need to see construction cost be at for development yields to be a more attractive pursuit than lease-up acquisitions.
Brad Hill: Yeah. I mean, we have seen construction cost come down, I mean, really over the the better part of 2024. It it, you know, was not as broad-based in 2024. I mean, selectively, we saw, you know, four to five percent reduction in certain markets. I would say at this point, we were seeing it in additional markets probably in that, you know, five percent or so range. And, generally, that is more in the you know, we have seen some labor reduction. We have really seen reduction seen seen some improvement there. And I think for us to to continue to increase our development, you know, we we need to see cost a combination of cost and and rent improvement to the tune of, you know, call it five percent to seven percent additionally. And, you know, we have a a pipeline of sites that we own with with projects that are approved. And to the extent we continue to see some improvement in the in the underwriting of those with construction costs and rents. More of those will begin to pencil as we progress throughout this year.
Ann Chan: Great. Thanks so much.
Omotayo Okusanya: Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning. Again, let me add my my congratulations as well with, you know, with the transition. Eric, maybe this gives you a little bit more time to get that next PR in a marathon. Yes. My my question has to do with again, you guys have been very offensive-minded, in the past year or so. I am looking for opportunities for kind of distress opportunities to kind of take advantage of some of the oversupply and what did you do to developers. But it sounds like, again, cap rate tracking, this is a still pretty tight. It does not sound like a that much distress out there. So when we kind of think about again, this opportunity that you have described for the better part of the past one year, just you know, how real could it actually be and, you know, how do you kind of start thinking about maybe, again, opportunities to kind of buy things? Well, you know, replacement cost or, you know, those kind of opportunities that are really kind of value-added that creates shareholder value typically in environment of of distress.
Brad Hill: Yes. Hi. It is Brad. You know, definitely, we we have not seen a lot of this frankly. And and we will continue to focus where where we have, and that is that is generally in, you know, these projects that are in lease-up. I mean, we do think that you know, those will continue to face a bit of pressure just given the amount of supply that is out there and given the strength of our operating platform, I mean, we we are tooled to to really take advantage of those. And there are some some sellers out there that are interested in some of those properties earlier before they are stabilized, and it still generates a very similar return for their capital but if they waited till it stabilized and they sold at a higher price. So based on our experience in our markets, our relationships, you know, we are still able to find opportunities like that. We were able to get, you know, some of these assets at some of these high yields close to 6%. Basis at replacement well below replacement cost. So we will continue to focus in that area. You know, you could see some distress perhaps in some of the older assets that that, you know, sold in 2020, 2021 with refinancing that has to come due. But for the most part, some of that you know, most of that would not be something that we are interested generally.
Omotayo Okusanya: It is helpful. And if I could ask one other quick one. Again, thanks for the update about bad debt and delinquencies. Curious again about some of the fraud-related issues that were kind of going on in some of your market. What you are seeing in terms of that, whether it is kind of gotten worse or gotten better, both in terms of just overall activity, also in terms of some of your preventive measures as well against these issues.
Tim Argo: Hi. This is Tim. I think you were asking about fraud and that. Is that correct? You kind of cut out there for a second. Yes. Correct. We have seen continued, you know, lowering pressure out with say, Atlanta has been the market that has been talked about a lot, then our delinquency there is is just about consistent with where we are at the broader portfolio level. Mean, we have a a lot of tools in place, both in terms of you know, sort of Yeah. Machine learning type of stuff plus, you know, training that we do both on-site and and some resources we have that at the corporate level as well to where if there is anything that looks a little bit off in terms of, you know, income documentation or ID or whatever, we have got people that are trained to really help spot that and and take a look at those. So get it being very preventative. It has been helpful. You know, it probably hurt occupancy for a while there in Atlanta, but it is it is gonna be better long term, and we started to see that play out with continued lower bad debt. So, honestly, not not much of an issue at all. Us.
Omotayo Okusanya: Thank you.
John Kim: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
John Kim: Thank you. And, Eric, congratulations on transforming Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. from good to great. Brad, I had a question. I had a question on in the press release, you talked about some markets seeing positive lease-over-lease rates versus last year. And I am wondering what comp what markets are. Where you feel most bullish about which markets will be driving the improvement in blended lease growth this year?
Tim Argo: Hey, John. This is Tim. I will I will answer some of the detail there. So we did see, you know, thirteen markets where we had positive blended in January. Which was encouraging. And it was it was pretty widespread among some some mid-tier and smaller and and some larger markets as well. I would point to Tampa as one that you know, we are we have really seen some good traction in the last two quarters or so and has has trended above portfolio. I think that is one where we could see some improving performance in 2025. You know, when you think about good markets, if you will, there is there is the ones that have been good or gonna drive good revenue now, then there is the ones where the pricing is improving and it is more tip of the the spirit. It will not show up in revenue till later. So the the first bucket is gonna be some of the ones we have talked about. It is DC. It is Houston. It is it is Charleston. Those are we expect to continue to be strong. Then there is markets like Tampa, and I would put Orlando in that bucket as well that are starting to show some some improvement. And we think you know, as you get in a minute later this year, those are a couple that we expect to see some some better performance from. And then we will you know, Austin is still one that we expect to continue to to be a a laggard with the continuing supply pressure there. But Tampa, Orlando would be two that I would point out as as trending markets for us.
John Kim: And then to get to your negative one and a half percent new lease rate for the year, what kind of market rent growth are you assuming? And if you can comment on your current gain to lease and how much of a headwind that will be in order to get that the new lease growth rate.
Tim Argo: Having gain only is about one percent right now. Which it it always tends to gap out this time of the year when when pricing is weakest. So, you know, I would expect we saw January market rents were a little bit higher, about half percent higher than what December were. So I think that will that will trend up through the summer and then trend back down. But, you know, probably the the best way to think about is just just we talked about our newly lease lease-over rates you know, for the full year, expect to be kind of in that negative one and a half percent range. So, you know, over the full year, it should that should correlate pretty well with with market rent growth.
John Kim: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: We have no further questions. I will return the call to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.
Eric Bolton: Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. for closing remarks. Okay. No further comments from the company. So we appreciate everyone joining us, and we will see many of you at the conference in February or March. See.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect at this time.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Mid-America Apartment Communities or MAA's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. During management's prepared comments, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded today Thursday, October 31, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening remarks.
Andrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Julianne, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team participating on the call this morning are Eric Bolton, Brad Hill, Tim Argo, Clay Holder, and Rob DelPriore. Before being with prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe Risk Factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial debt. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. Third quarter results for core FFO were ahead of our expectations as same-store NOI came in better than our forecast. Based on our analysis, we believe that peak deliveries of new supply that is impacting our sub-markets and properties occurred this past third quarter. Despite this record-high supply pressure in Q3, we were able to capture solid performance in occupancy, record low resident turnover, strong collections and better than expected performance with operating expenses, which all contributed to the third quarter NOI results. In addition, as Tim will detail in his comments, we are beginning to see early trends with new lease pricing that support our position that the worst of the pressures on pricing from new supply are likely behind us. As we have been discussing for the past year or so, we are now poised to see moderating trends in the amount of new supply deliveries that are impacting our portfolio as we head into 2025. We expect to see normal seasonal leasing patterns for the next couple of quarters and remain convinced that the spring leasing season will usher in the start of a recovery cycle with more favorable leasing conditions as demand and absorption trends across our markets remain strong and the volume of new supply deliveries steadily declines. With strengthening leasing conditions, significant redevelopment opportunity in our existing portfolio and meaningful efficiency gains from various new technology initiatives, we are excited about the upside outlook from our asset base. This momentum coupled with the significant expansion of our external growth pipeline from our in house new development projects, our prepurchase joint venture program and our recent new property acquisitions all combined for what we believe is a positive outlook for meaningful value growth. Before turning the call over to Brad, I'd like to send my appreciation out to our MAA associates for their tremendous work and great results over this very busy third quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Brad.
Brad Hill: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. MAA's long-term strategy of focusing on high-growth markets and diversifying within those markets uniquely positions our portfolio to benefit from the continued strong demand in our footprint. As an attractive, more-affordable alternative to much of the higher priced new multifamily supply being delivered as well as the available single-family housing options, our residents are choosing to stay with us longer, with only 11.5% of our move-outs occurring due to residents buying a home. Our customer service is reflected in our Google Scores, which continues to lead the sector, supports our strong renewals and record low turnover rate. With our 60 day exposure, which represents all current vacancies and notices over the next 60 days, 30 basis points better than last year and new deliveries poised to decline, our communities are well positioned for the seasonally slower months and for what we believe will be a stronger leasing environment in the spring summer of 2025. Throughout this year, we've continued to make progress using our balance sheet capacity to support future earnings growth. In the third quarter, we added two new projects to our under construction development pipeline, bringing our total under construction developments to eight projects, representing 2,762 units at a cost of approximately $978 million a record level of development for MAA. In addition to the previously disclosed 239 unit Charlotte project, where we provided financing to take out the equity partner on an under construction community, we also closed and started construction on a 360, excuse me, 306 unit community in Richmond and Virginia in the third quarter. The Richmond project was a fully entitled, shovel ready development that we took over from a developer who was unable to obtain financing. The Charlotte project should deliver first units in the third quarter of 2025 and we expect the Richmond project to deliver first units in first quarter of 2027. We expect to start construction on one more project during the fourth quarter, bringing our total development starts for the year to five at a cost of $508 million, exceeding our original guidance for the year. We expect these projects to deliver an average expected stabilized NOI yield of 6.3%. With our development pipeline approaching $1 billion, our focus turns to maintaining our pipeline at this level going forward. Pre-development work continues on a number of projects in our pipeline, which now includes 10 projects, representing future growth of over 2,800 units at an expected cost of $1.1 billion. We have seen some construction cost declines in a few markets and remain hopeful that as the total under construction pipeline in our markets continues its steep decline, we could see further improvement in construction cost and schedules as well as we get into 2025, supporting our ability to start construction on additional opportunities at compelling yields. In the transaction market, volume remains relatively low with cap rates trending down into the high 4% range. Our team continues to find select but compelling acquisition opportunities at pricing the market cap rates, generally in lease up and often on an off market basis. In the third quarter, we closed on a 310 unit suburban property in Orlando for approximately $84 million approximately 10% below replacement costs. This newly constructed property is nearly stabilized at just under 90% occupancy. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on a closed on a 386 unit mid-rise property in the Knox Henderson area of Dallas at pricing 15% below current replacement costs. This property just wrapped up construction and is in its initial lease up. This brings our total acquisition volume for the year to just over $270 million at an average stabilized NOI yield of 5.9%. Our team is actively evaluating other acquisition opportunities and we are hopeful, we'll close another compelling acquisition before year end. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold a 216 unit property in Charlotte, North Carolina for $39 million and we have an additional property in Richmond, Virginia under contract to sell with an expected closing during the fourth quarter. We have two more properties in Columbia, South Carolina on the market with a likely closing in early 2025. Before I turn the call over to Tim, I want to echo Eric's comments to our associates. Thank you for your hard work and dedication during this busy third quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Tim.
Tim Argo: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As noted by both Eric and Brad, various demand metrics we track remain strong, partially mitigating the impact of new supply deliveries that we believe peaked in the third quarter. 60 day exposure is better than at any point over the last five years. The seasonal deceleration of Middle East pricing is less than the prior year and pre-COVID periods and absorption remains strong. However, pricing growth particularly on new leases continues to be impacted by elevated new supply deliveries, but as noted showed less seasonal deceleration than we typically see this time of the year. For the third quarter, new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis was minus 5.4%, just a 30 basis point decline from the second quarter compared to a 270 basis point decline over the same period last year. In fact, 10 of our top 15 highest concentration markets showed new lease-over-lease growth acceleration from the second to third quarter. Renewal rates for the quarter stayed strong growing [Technical Difficulty] lease-over-lease basis. These two components resulted in lease-over-lease pricing on a blended basis of minus 0.2%, also a 30 basis point decline from the second quarter and compared to a 220 basis point decline over the same period last year. Average physical occupancy was 95.7%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter, demonstrating the strong absorption in our markets. Collections continue to outperform expectations with net delinquency representing just 0.4% of billed rents. All these factors drove the resulting same store revenue that was in line with the third quarter of 2023. Along with the demand metrics noted, our unique market diversification strategy that Brad mentioned continues to benefit overall portfolio results. As we have mentioned previously, several of our mid-tier markets are holding up better in this higher supply environment. Savannah, Richmond, Charleston, Greenville and our Fredericksburg and our other Northern Virginia properties are all outperforming the broader portfolio from a blended lease-over-lease pricing standpoint. Particularly in a down cycle, our portfolio balance between large and mid-tier markets helped strengthen overall portfolio performance. Also as has been the case all year, Austin, Atlanta and Jacksonville are markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the absolute level of supply being delivered into those markets with Austin being the toughest challenge of all the markets. We continue to execute on our various redevelopment and repositioning initiatives, where it makes sense in this elevated supply environment with the expectation of starting to reaccelerate next year. For the third quarter of 2024, we completed over 1,700 interior unit upgrades, achieving rate increases of $108 above non-upgraded units. We are encouraged by the strength of this program in this competitive environment demonstrated by the fact that these units lease quicker on average than a non-renovated unit when adjusted for the additional turn time. For our repositioning program, we have two active projects that are in the repricing phase with NOI yields approaching 10%. We have an additional six projects underway with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in the spring of 2025, in what we believe will be an improving leasing environment. As we wrap up, October, we are seeing normal seasonal moderation but are encouraged by demand that should continue to keep the sequential seasonal pricing deceleration better than historical trends. Our 60 day exposure of 6.3% should serve to keep occupancy stable and allow for more pricing power than last year, as we also start to lap new lease pricing that weakened significantly during the fourth quarter of last year. Absorption remains strong in our markets with the third quarter representing the first time since the first quarter of 2022 that units absorbed exceeded units delivered. Therefore, there is not a significant backlog of inventory needing to be absorbed. Accordingly, October new lease pricing is within 10 basis points of September new lease pricing, demonstrating this demand and our expectation of less seasonal moderation in the fourth quarter than we normally experience. Furthermore, lease-over-lease rates on accepted renewals for November and December in the 4.25 range. We will only reprice approximately 16% of our leases in the fourth quarter, which minimizes the impact of this moderation on the portfolio. As we have discussed over the last few quarters, new supply deliveries continue to be a headwind in many of our markets. However, we still believe the near-term outlook is in line with what we have discussed last few quarters. That is we expect this new supply will begin to moderate and that we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease-over-lease pricing growth and that the supply-demand balance continues to improve from here subject to normal seasonality. At a portfolio level, construction starts in our footprint peaked in mid-2022 and we have seen historically that the maximum pressure on leasing is typically about two years after construction start. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Clay.
Clay Holder: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.21 per share, which was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our third quarter guidance. Just under $0.03 of the favorability was related to favorable same-store expenses, with an additional $0.02 driven by a combination of favorable overhead cost, interest expense and non-operating income. Our same-store revenue results for the quarter were relatively in line with expectations. As Tim mentioned, same-store revenues benefited from strong occupancy during the quarter. Our same-store expense performance, particularly real estate taxes was favorable compared to our guidance for the quarter. We've received property valuations for our Florida portfolio, which were lower than our expectations. Repairs and maintenance costs continue to show moderation, growing at 2% compared to third quarter last year. During the quarter, we funded nearly $167 million of development cost of the current $978 million pipeline, leaving an expected $368 million to be funded on this pipeline over the next two to three years. We also invested approximately $13 million of capital through our redevelopment and repositioning programs during the quarter, which we expect to produce solid returns and continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio. Our balance sheet remains solid. We ended the quarter with just over $800 million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund future investments. Our leverage remains low with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.9x. At quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 90% fixed with an average maturity of seven years at an effective rate of 3.8%. Finally, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our same-store NOI and core FFO guidance for the year, while revising other areas of our detailed guidance that we've previously provided. Given our operating results achieved through the third quarter, we are slightly adjusting the midpoint of effective rent growth guidance by 15 basis points to 0.35% and revising total same-store revenue guidance for the year to 0.5% at the midpoint. With property valuations for our Florida portfolio now known, we have more insight into our overall real estate tax expense for 2024, and are lowering the midpoint of our guidance to 2%. This results in the lowering of our property operating expense growth projections for the year to 3.75% at the midpoint. The changes to our property operating expense projections, combined with our updated same-store revenue expectations, results in reaffirming our original midpoint expectation for same-store NOI at minus 1.3%. In addition to updating our same-store operating projections, we are revising our 2024 guidance to reflect favorable trends in G&A and interest expense. These adjustments combined with the $0.02 to $0.03 of estimated impact of clean-up cost related to storms in the fourth quarter resulted in us to maintain the midpoint of our full year core FFO guidance at $8.88 per share, while narrowing the range to $8.80 to $8.96 per share. Including the fourth quarter, we estimate our 2024 results will include approximately $0.08 to $0.09 of total storm clean-up costs compared to $0.01 of cost included in our initial 2024 guidance. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Julianne, we will now turn the call back to you for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jamie Feldman: I guess just to start, can you talk about your 4Q expectations for blended rent growth and occupancy? You may have run through them, but I think it went kind of quickly. I don't know that I got it all. But I guess just trying to figure out, if you think about year-end occupancy, you sounded pretty positive on demand and on renewals. So just what do you think in the year end and how 4Q looks for occupancy and blends?
Tim Argo : Jamie, this is Tim. Yes, I think, in terms of occupancy pretty consistent with where we are right now. We're at 95.4% currently. I think 95.4% to 95.5% for Q4 is a range we're comfortable with, particularly with where we see exposure right now. As I mentioned in my comments, the renewal rates that we're getting for November and December in the 4.25% range, so call it 4% to 4.5% for the fourth quarter in terms of renewals. And then, on new lease pricing, we mentioned the new lease pricing for October moderated only about 10 basis points from September. It was 6.9% in September, 7% in October. I think you see a little bit of moderation from here but not much and see less deceleration than we typically do as we commented in the call.
Jamie Feldman: And then, I mean, guidance -- full year guidance now seemed conservative when you first gave it. As we think about '25, I mean, is there still a lot of juice to get on the expense side that could help you with efficiencies or anything else, or do you think you get back to more of a normalized growth rate?
Tim Argo : Yes. I think just kind of thinking through the expense structure, I mean, starting with real estate tax expenses and insurance. The growth that we've seen in real estate tax expenses of about 2%. Yes, I believe that will be a little tough to repeat that level at next year. I would think that, that would get some more of a normalized growth rate, call it, somewhere between 3% and 4%. But I believe that, that would be appropriate for real estate taxes insurance. We had the slight decrease in our premium renewal this past July. And so, we'll get that for the first half of next year and then we'll have to reprice in July of next year. It's hard to say at this point where that's going to ultimately end up. I don't think it gets back to the levels of increases that we saw over the past couple of years, but also don't think it's going to be flat either. So somewhere in the 5% to 10% range, keeping in mind that insurance is just a small piece of our overall expense debt. And then, regards to personnel costs, I think that continues to moderate a little bit. And as we get some of these inflationary impacts behind us, some more things for repair and maintenance. We've talked about some of the moderation we've seen this past year in repair and maintenance. I don't know that we'll be back at that level, in 2025, but I think it will also be more of a reasonable growth rate, something around 3% to 3.5%. Marketing expenses, I think would be the other one to call out that continue may run a little high at the first half of the year, but I would expect that to come back down, as we comp some of these increases that we've seen this past year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Josh Dennerlein: I'm just kind of curious, is there any way to kind of quantify like the impact of, like, the deliveries on that new lease rate growth? Are there any good examples of markets where you didn't really have supply pressure and maybe just how the new lease rate growth trended in those markets versus more supply heavy markets?
Clay Holder: Yes. There are a couple of markets. Austin, as we've talked about all year, continues to be our most-challenging market and we saw new lease rates in Austin pick up in a negative way quite a bit from Q2 to Q3. We saw a little bit in Raleigh. But I think the point as far as Q3 is concerned, it was pretty targeted to a couple of markets. I made a comment in the prepared comments that out of our 15 highest concentration markets, we actually saw 10 of those 15 new lease rates accelerate. And so, actually if you pull out -- if you focus on just Austin and pull that -- pull the new lease rates in Austin out of both the Q2 and Q3 numbers, we actually would have seen new lease rate from Q2 to Q3 accelerate about 10 basis points, as opposed to a 30 basis point decline. Certainly, Austin was a big driver. Atlanta continues to be a struggle, but obviously, we feel really good about Austin long-term and it's just working through a lot of supply but it did have an outsized impact on what we saw with new lease rates.
Josh Dennerlein: And then, in those higher-supply markets, were those also skewing renewal rates down as well? Because do you have like a similar status for renewal if you like strip out Austin for the high supply markets?
Clay Holder: Yes. I mean, it impacts renewals to some extent. If you think about for the third quarter, renewals were what somewhere in the 4% range, 4.1%. Austin was 1.5% to give you some perspective on that. It does tend to impact renewal rates a little bit but we certainly see much stronger renewal spreads than we do even for some of those more challenging markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Daniel Tricarico: Hi, good morning, guys. It's Daniel Tricarico on with Nick. I want to clarify how you're thinking about this peaking of supply ultimately impacting market rent growth next year. I'm obviously not talking guidance, but there's obviously still a lot of units to absorb. So just curious how you'd see that relative change in supply impacting the seasonal curve in market rents in those higher supply markets?
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean, as we've talked about supply definitely peaked sort of the mid to second, third quarter of 2022 and that's pretty consistent across all our markets. Some of them lagged or were ahead of that maybe a quarter or so, but pretty consistent. And as we talked about we think about two years from start is when we see the maximum amount of pressure, which is kind of about right now and what we saw in Q3. I think we'll see a little bit of moderating pressure in Q4 won't necessarily show up with seasonal moderation and just less traffic, less leases expiring. So I think as we get into the spring and summer, I would expect, we'll see normal seasonality just like we would any other period, but start to see some strength particularly on the new lease side, as demand picks up seasonally and as the impact of the moderating supply, which we think in general supply is probably down 20% or so in 2025 as compared to 2024. So should start to see that strength, as we get into the spring.
Daniel Tricarico: And then can you just quantify what your -- what you'd expect the loss to lease and revenue earning to be at the end of the year?
Tim Argo : Yes. I think in terms of earn-in, if you think about our blended lease-over-lease expectations for full year of 2024, it's somewhere in that negative 3% range and half of that if not a little more carries over into 2025 which kind of drives the earn-in. So, slightly negative call it 20 basis points, 30 basis points somewhere in that range where we sit right now in terms of earn-in.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Goldsmith: Absorption was clearly a positive in the quarter. Do you assume that elevated absorption levels continue through the remainder of the year, level of demand is baked into guidance? And have you seen traffic or conversion levels move or change as we've moved into the slower leasing season?
Tim Argo : I'm not sure I caught all of that but I know you were asking about absorption initially. I mean, yes, we don't see any reason for absorption to go backwards. I mean, if you look at absorption so far this year, Q1 was a record high for any first quarter since we've been tracking it. Q2 was the highest absorption since early 2021. And Q3 as I mentioned saw us actually absorb more units than we delivered for the first time since Q1 in 2022. We don't see anything on the demand side that's moderating. I mean, you think about job growth, household formation, population growth, move-outs to buy a home, we expect turnover to continue to stay low. So I think demand will hold up strong and as supply starts to moderate, which we think it will, I would expect absorption to be as good if not better as we look into 2025.
Michael Goldsmith: And as a follow-up and I'll try to streamline the guidance better, but just how are concession levels trending for merchant developer lease up properties? Are you offering any concession at stabilized properties? And maybe just can you frame the price differential if there is any between the typical MAA property and the new developments?
Tim Argo : Yes. I mean, broadly concessions in Q3 were pretty consistent with Q2. I mean, it's pretty standard in a lot of markets that you're seeing on in a stabilized submarket half a month to a month, something like that. Now we are seeing in lease-up areas a little more than that, and it's the markets I mentioned, particularly Austin and Atlanta. In Austin, you're seeing up to three months when you think about Central Austin and Georgetown area and then particularly in Midtown Atlanta seeing up to three months. So I'll call out those two kind of submarket markets as the highest concessionary environment but pretty consistent with what it's been in most of our other markets. But we are still seeing, if we look at the new supply being delivered on aggregate, it's about anywhere from $250 to $300 higher price point than our average portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern : Obviously, leverage is still well below the long-term target and it seems like you're seeing a lot of opportunities, both on the acquisition and development fronts. Does it make sense to grow at this point using mainly leverage to get metrics back into the target range? Or do you want to save that capacity for something bigger?
Clay Holder : Yes. Right now, that's kind of where we're leaning into. I mean, when we look at our cost of equity versus our cost of debt, right now, we're actually trading at probably a slight discount. So we're going to probably lean more into the debt side versus the equity for the time being. But as things begin to change and we expect to get a little bit more benefit there on the equity side at some point, and we'd probably lean a little bit more in that direction when the time is right.
Brad Heffern : And then I think I heard you say 3% gain to lease earlier on the call, correct me if I'm wrong, but I would think that, that will weigh on new lease spreads in '25. I'm just curious, big picture, when you think we might see those actually turn positive.
Tim Argo : We didn't say 3%. I think our gain to lease right now, looking at -- if you look at where October rents or October leases compared to in-place rents, it's about 0.7% gain to lease, which is not too unusual this time of year with seasonal pricing starts to decelerate some seasonally, so it's not a big number for us right now. I think what we did talk about was just kind of the earn-in being slightly negative headed into 2025. And then I would expect we see better new lease pricing in 2025 as compared to what we saw in 2024.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb : Two questions here. First, just based on your responses to a lot of the other analysts, it sounds like, one, Atlanta and Austin are the only two markets of supply concern. And then two, it sounds like your comments around strengthening '25 and being in a better leasing position is predicated on the current run rate of absorption, meaning like even though you expect absorption rates to improve, your comments around expectations of leasing for '25 aren't predicated on improving absorptions based on the current trend.
Tim Argo : Yes. I would say your second point is right. I mean, we're -- we would expect to see consistent demand, certainly consistent, if not a little bit better absorption but where we think and we'd like to see that play out is more on rates and more new lease rates as opposed to trying to get occupancy to 96% or 96.5%, something like that we would prefer to focus on rates. To your first point, I mean, I wouldn't say that we're the only ones feeling supply pressure. Those are certainly feeling more supply pressure. I mean, most of our markets are getting more supply than what we would call a typical market but holding up a little better, given where the supply is occurring relative to our markets and demand and all that. So we're certainly in a more elevated supply picture, but also in Atlanta are ones that stand out a little bit. But I think those start to get better next year as do most of our other markets.
Eric Bolton : I think it's -- Alex, this is Eric. I think it's important to just recap what Tim said earlier is that of our 15 largest markets, 10 of those actually saw new lease-over-lease pricing improve in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. And if you take just Austin out of the mix and just exclude Austin from our Q2 and Q3 performance trends on new lease pricing, our new lease pricing in Q3 would have been up 10 basis points from where it was in Q2. So Austin clearly is having an outsized impact on the portfolio right now. We feel great about that market long-term. But certainly in 2024, it's weighing on the performance of the portfolio as a whole, given just the absolute level of supply that came into that one market.
Alexander Goldfarb : The second question just revolves around the hurricane. Obviously some big storms. As you guys assess your portfolio because it's incredible, the REITs never really seem to have any major damage, is it a matter of either, one, you guys really only buy properties or invest in properties that are away from rivers, are away from shore lines are elevated? Or is it some of the steps you're taking? Or why is it that we see some devastation but then when the REITs report like you guys, the damage is minimum? Just trying to understand if that's active management on your part as far as how you select the properties and where geographically you're keeping or if there's something else that worked?
Robert DelPriore : It's Rob. I think it's really a combination of factors. I think part of it is the selection of the sites and what we're building. But ultimately, it's the ongoing repair and maintenance that we're spending on the properties, making sure that the roofs are relatively new, they're intact and the preparation we do before the storms come in really assist with minimizing our damage. So it really is only cleanup that we're stuck with and kind of some landscaping and other smaller things.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste : Can you talk a bit about the transaction market and the opportunities coming across your desk? It seems like more sellers willing to engage with cap rates down to 5% and even sub-5% as you noted. So as you guys look at the opportunities coming across your desk, what are the key items or non-negotiables you're seeking? Is it newer assets with operational upside as you talked about previously? And then maybe some color on the compelling, I think was the word used, opportunities that you're looking at here potentially closing by year-end? Is that a comment on the size, value creation, IRR potential? What's so compelling? Some color would be appreciated.
Brad Hill: Haendel, this is Brad. I mean, generally, relative to the compelling comment that really is similar to what we're investing in today. And if you look at the stabilized NOI yields of the three acquisitions we've had this year at 5.9% relative to where current market cap rates are, those are pretty compelling returns, I would say. Really, what we're focused on and where we're finding our opportunities are on properties that are generally brand new. Most times they are just finishing up their initial lease-up -- or excuse me, just finishing up construction and just entering in their initial lease-up. It's assets that are tougher for other folks to get financed. But given our ability to close all cash, we have some competitive advantage versus others in the market. There's also opportunities for us to put our operating platform on these assets to drive additional returns that many other folks can't do. Oftentimes, we're looking for properties that are in proximity to current assets that we have, where we're able to plot those properties and really generate additional returns. So those are kind of the competitive angles that we're looking for where we're able to generate additional returns. And then the last point I would just make is generally, a lot of what we're doing is off-market. We have extensive relationships in this region of the country exclusively operating for 30 years. About 80% of the $2 billion that we purchased over the last 10 years have been with merchant developers. So we have extensive relationships that we're able to lean on that allow us to -- the opportunity to execute at returns that often exceed what the market rates are.
Haendel St. Juste : And just going back to development pipeline for a moment now up to over $1 billion, I think you mentioned, and with a sizable opportunity beyond that with the shadow pipeline, I guess I'm curious how large could that development pipeline included near-term, how aggressive could you be given the [inaudible] that you see into '26? And then maybe some color on [inaudible] likely to be started next? And how you're thinking about underwriting the rent growth in those markets in the next couple of years?
Brad Hill: Yes. If I forget something in that question, please let me know. But yes, I mean, in terms of the size of the development pipeline, we've commented for a couple of years now really a desire to build that pipeline to $1 billion, $1.2 billion total size. Today, we're just under $1 billion so we've got a little bit of room to grow that a little bit. That would equate to about three to four starts a year in over a three year period, which is really the time line it takes for most of these projects that gets us to our $1 billion, $1.2 billion. So that's really -- we're very comfortable, given the size of our balance sheet of really maintaining our pipeline at that level. And clearly, given what we think are going to be strong operating fundamentals in '26, '27, this is a great time for us to be ramping up that development pipeline to that $1 billion, $1.2 billion level. In terms of how we're underwriting these projects very conservatively, the developments that we have delivering today on average, even in this high supply environment, we're exceeding our underwriting on average by about 50 basis points. So we underwrite very conservatively. Very little trending in rents for the first few years. And typically, you get to year three, year four, you start trending a little bit more. We're trending our expenses the entire hold period. So that's generally how we underwrite our deals but on a very conservative basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from Buck Horne from Raymond James.
Buck Horne : I just wanted to follow-up on that. Just thinking about the Richmond asset in terms of the start there, as you're rebuilding the development pipeline, thinking about new -- or your large markets versus mid-tier markets, would you expect to kind of restock and maybe look at more development opportunities in those mid-tier markets? And I'm kind of wondering what the differential in yields might be to do a development in a larger market versus a mid-tier market right now.
Brad Hill: Buck, this is Brad. Yes, I mean, we definitely believe in our strategy of allocating capital between both large markets and these mid-tier markets. So we are very much committed to continuing to growing our presence and allocating capital both through acquisitions and development in some of these mid-tier markets. And really, it's been a function of just where the opportunities have come. So we haven't seen as many opportunities, given the lower level of supply in some of these mid-tier markets but we are seeing some of those opportunities. Now, we acquired the Raleigh project earlier this year, the development here in Richmond. So you'll see us continue to have a focus in those mid-tier markets. I would say from a stabilized yield perspective, there's maybe 10 basis points, 20 basis points difference in today's rate. So Richmond's close to 6.5% and some of the other projects are maybe 6.25%, 6.3%. So there's not a big swing in terms of some of the yields for these projects. But really, that is going to manifest itself maybe a little bit on IRRs where we're getting higher IRRs on the projects in the secondary markets as the exit cap rates may be a little bit different. But that's really the only difference in terms of the underwriting projects.
Buck Horne : Second question, with some of these new mandates coming out for return to office, I know it's maybe not as big in Sunbelt markets, but have you seen any changes or shifts recently in terms of traffic re-leasing patterns in urban locations versus suburban locations that might be affected by certain return to office policies?
Tim Argo : Mike, this is Tim. Nothing that we've seen at a material level. I mean, we did see -- we talked about performance between A and B assets in urban, suburban. We did see that narrow a little bit with our urban properties performing a little bit better. I'm not sure that's necessarily related to anything return to office but we did see a little bit of performance there. But broadly speaking, not seeing a lot of shift in any of the metrics that we track.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Wolfe from Citi.
Eric Wolfe: As you get ready to give guidance next year, I guess what will you be looking at over the next couple of months to determine your view on market rent growth or blended spreads for next year? I think you said new leases might be down like 7% or 8% in November and December. Does that even weigh into your view? Does it not really matter? Just wondering what we should be looking at to kind of understand what market rent growth should be like next year.
Tim Argo : Yes, this is Tim. I mean, I think new lease pricing is the key metric that we're looking at in terms of -- it's not going to -- what happens in the rest of this quarter is not going to be impactful necessarily to 2024, but it does have some impact to some extent on earn-in and where we start the year. Occupancy, we think will be relatively stable and so it's going to [inaudible] and we think renewals will continue to be stable. They've been in that 4% to 5% range all throughout this year so we don't expect to see that change necessarily. So it will come down to the new lease rates and sort of where those -- how those play out and then we'll have more to say as we get into Q4 earnings release. But certainly, sitting here today compared to where we were 12 months ago, I feel a lot better both in just macroeconomic variables. Recession risk is down. There's a little more certainty there. We know supply is starting to moderate and so feel pretty good that sets up for a little bit better year. I mean, it's still going to be elevated supply. And even in a normal environment, new lease rates in Q1 and Q4 are typically negative so we don't expect that necessarily to change. But we do expect to see a little more positive momentum in terms of new lease pricing when we get into Q2 and Q3.
Eric Bolton : Yes, the other thing that I'll add to that quickly on top of Tim's comment is that don't forget what Tim mentioned in that we intentionally only have about 16% of our leases expiring in the fourth quarter. And then you consider that roughly a good percentage of those are going to renew as a renewal transaction versus a new lease transaction. So the overall impact on earn-in from new lease performance between now and the end of the year is not as significant as you might think it is, given the low percentage of leases set to expire and the split between renewal and new lease pricing that will take place.
Eric Wolfe: And then I guess, are there any other items that we should be thinking about when it comes to your revenue growth potential next year? I know I sometimes ask about this other income, but I think you've been studying the Wi-Fi cable program. So I was curious if that might pick up next year, if that's maybe an opportunity more for like 2026 and 2027.
Tim Argo : Yes. I mean, you called out one that can start to have an impact. I mean, we're testing or retrofitting four properties this year that are just now starting to go live that have that property-wide ubiquitous Wi-Fi, if you will. And so if you think about those four properties by themselves is once it's fully rolled out and kind of flows through the portfolio is close to $1 million. So you can start to extrapolate the opportunities that we have there. We expect to expand that pretty significantly next year, initially looking at maybe 20 to 25 properties that we do in 2025. So on the revenue side that would be one that I'd call out. We're wrapping up the smart installations at the last few properties now. There'll be a little bit of tailwind from that in 2025, but other than rent growth and stable occupancy, I think the Wi-Fi starts to slowly have a bit of an impact.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim : As far as hurricane and storm-related costs, you don't exclude or add back those costs to get to your core FFO, which I think is a really standout policy versus maybe some of your peers. But going forward, will you be including a larger assumed expense in your guidance as you look to 2025? And how do you think about exposure in some of these markets like Tampa?
Clay Holder : Yes, John, this is Clay. So I think whenever you kind of look at what the cost that we had -- that we were projecting for the full year this year, it's going to be somewhere around $10 million, $9 million, $10 million call it. When you look back at over the, call it, past seven years, six, seven years, we haven't had anything of this magnitude that we've had to deal with. And it's been spread across each quarter this year. It hasn't been just one quarter or one storm. It's been multiple storms impacting us throughout the year. So I think as we look towards next year, that's not something we've traditionally done in the past as far as including some storm cost in our guidance, but we did include $0.01 in our guidance this past year [inaudible] earnings back in February and then released our 2024 guidance in February. So we reflected that but that's the only cost that we reflected in our guidance. But as we look forward to next year, I think that you expect to see something in there. It will not be at the levels that we experienced this year just because history has shown that that's the norm. But I would expect it will include something in our guidance to account for that.
John Kim : And then does it make you think differently about some of your Florida exposure? I know you just purchased something in Orlando. But as far as Tampa and maybe some other markets where insurance cost could be pretty significant?
Clay Holder : Well the one that's -- the insurance cost in Florida gets a lot of publicity. Of course, one thing you have to consider is just our overall portfolio and that we're able to defer a little bit of that risk across all of our markets, not just in the Florida market. So we're still committed to Florida. Yes, there's some higher costs related to insurance there but just given our size and portfolio of our platform that we have across the portfolio, we can still take advantage of some opportunities there.
John Kim : And just to clarify, you do exclude these costs from same-store expense but do you keep those effective properties in the same-store pool?
Clay Holder : Yes. We -- you got to think over these -- the damage that we've seen has been extremely moderate, so damage is probably a strong word. It's more of a cleanup that we see whenever we -- these properties are typically impacted. If you do have a property that was significantly damaged, lost a number of units that had to -- that would not be able to be occupied, we would probably remove that property from same-store while it was being repaired and put back into service. So we'll treat that particular property as appropriate based on our general policy of how we include stores and same-store versus non-same store. But to your point, these cleanup costs, we've reflected those as non-same store costs in our earnings calls, we don't want it to impact the comparability of the same-store portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Blouin from Goldman Sachs.
Julien Blouin : I just want to make sure I heard a couple of numbers correctly. So the earn-in going into next year about negative 30 basis points and then gain to lease currently around negative 70 basis points. And then with -- my real sort of question here is with new lease spreads down 7% in October, do you still think we can get to sort of positive new lease spreads by spring, early summer? It just seems like quite the ramp to get there.
Tim Argo : Yes. To answer your first question, you have those numbers correct. That is what we stated. As far as new lease rates, we'll talk more about this, obviously, in our next quarter earnings. Difficult to say right now exactly where it will get to. We're kind of going through our budgeting planning process now. I think one point to make is through this year, our best new lease pricing was about negative 4%, negative 4.2%, something like that in July. We certainly expect to exceed that. And to reiterate a point I made earlier, in normal supply demand environments, Q1, Q4, typically negative new lease pricing anyway. So it's really Q2 and Q3 where you start to see it go positive. So more to come on that but we certainly believe all of the factors, supply and demand point to much better new lease performance in '25 than '24.
Robert DelPriore : And of course, the prior year comparisons factor into this as well.
Tim Argo : That's right.
Julien Blouin : Yes. On those sorts of comparisons, it does feel like the comparisons get a lot easier year-over-year in November and December, given just the new lease deceleration in concessions we saw last year. So if the worst of supply pressure is behind us and October held steady versus September, why wouldn't that sort of new lease spread begin to improve sequentially into November and December?
Tim Argo : Well, we'll see and it might. We certainly don't expect it to get much worse for all the reasons we've laid out, including those easier comps. It's always new lease is certainly the tip of the spear and can change on a dime. But we feel comfortable it's going to stay in this range, if not start to improve a little bit. But the other point is just there's not much leases as we mentioned, 16% and frankly not a lot of traffic, particularly when you get into mid-November on through December just with holidays, just not a lot of people searching. So it's not going to have a material impact one way or the other but it could -- we could see us sort of hanging in where it is right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley.
Adam Kramer : I just wanted to ask about kind of the portfolio opportunity out there. I think you've talked a little bit about kind of the one-off acquisition opportunities and clearly seeing you guys be a little bit more acquisitive there. But are you seeing any change in terms of kind of sellers of portfolios out there? We've seen some large portfolios trade recently. Is that something that maybe you guys can take advantage of? Or is the pricing there not kind of what you're looking for?
Brad Hill: Adam, this is Brad. I mean, generally, what we see on portfolios is a lot of times, the quality of the assets are not what we're looking for. There's some type of bad with the good, so to speak. In some of the portfolios that we've seen recently, I mean, frankly, part of that has been pricing. Some of the pricing on those assets were more aggressive than what we believed was appropriate or where we want to invest our capital. I mean, if you look at the three one-off acquisitions that we transacted on, close to 6% on an NOI yield basis for brand-new assets. So from an after-CapEx basis, it's pretty appealing, especially considered to where some of these portfolios are trading. And then if you take into account the age and after-CapEx nature of those, we just feel like what we've been able to do so far has been a very good strategy for us. Now if there's a portfolio out there that we think has some type of strategic nature to it, that makes us stronger in some way, we would absolutely take a look at that. And if it's accretive to earnings, we would be interested in looking at something like that.
Adam Kramer : And then just as a quick follow-up here. Just remind us where kind of the pre-COVID bad debt level or rule of thumb is and then kind of where you are today relative to that. And your view as to kind of getting back to that pre-COVID number, is that something that can happen in 2025 or is that still multiple years away?
Tim Argo : I mean, we're -- honestly, we're just about there. I mean, I think pre-COVID, it was anywhere from 30 basis points to 40 basis points of net delinquency. Right now, we're at about 40 basis points. So there's -- at most, there's 5 basis points to 10 basis points of difference in terms of where we were pre-COVID. We didn't -- they certainly didn't deteriorate near as much as some other markets and we've just now gotten back to where we were pre-COVID.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lewis from Truist Securities.
Michael Lewis : So Eric, in the press release last night and in your remarks, you said we're confident we will enter a new multi-year cycle with demand outpacing supply. One of the points of pushback I sometimes get is with cost pressures easing, the short-term interest rates coming down and developers who have capital like you are already starting projects that maybe this cycle will be short, right? That maybe what ends up happening is your same-store growth in '25 is similar or a little bit better than '24 and maybe '26 is a good year. And then by the time you get to '27, you have -- your next wave of deliveries. So maybe there's historical precedent or kind of what do you think about the reason why Sunbelt supply won't just rise up to meet the demand kind of more quickly than in the past?
Eric Bolton : Well, I think to put it in context, what's important to recall or remember is that the deliveries this year, this is not a normal supply cycle. The deliveries this year is a 50-year high, a 50-year high. And so do I think that by '27, 2028, and '29, that we could see supply levels pick up from where they will likely be in '25 and '26? It is certainly possible. You have to start to think about financing costs and construction costs and when things pencil out by that point in a way that is super compelling for developers. But I think that the idea that we are going to any time in the next 10 years repeat this 50-year high cycle, I think, is not reasonable, in my opinion. So I think that -- and of course, we've long believed that ultimately, what really drives performance and ability to drive value for shareholder capital over a long period of time is really the demand side of the business. We go through these periodic cycles where supply picks up, but because of some of the things Brad mentioned in terms of how we've diversified across both mid-tier and large tier markets, we think we can weather these supply cycles okay. And if you had told me two years ago, three years ago we were headed to a 50-year high delivery of new supply and that our NOI was only going to go down by 1.3%, I'd take that all day long. That's -- if that's as bad as it gets in a 50-year period, that's okay. And next year will be better. '26 will be even better. I think '27 and '28 will be even better. Now is it possible that again, supply picks up in '28, '29? Probably so. But I don't see us going back to another 50-year high.
Brad Hill: Yes, Michael, this is Brad. The only point I would add is if you look at the starts that occurred in first, second, third quarter of 2022, there's a very high correlation with that associated with where interest rates were, historic low interest rates. I think interest rates could come down a little bit from where they are today, but they certainly, we don't think, go back to that level that really spurred this kind of excessive 50-year high supply levels that Eric was talking about.
Michael Lewis : And I'm going to structure my second question kind of the same way, right? I'm going to read a brief excerpt from Cushman & Wakefield's 3Q National Apartment Report and then ask you a question. So they said, demand for apartment units is booming again. Resurgent international migration trends in recent years alongside a stout labor market continue to power some of the best multifamily demand on record. So maybe this is opening a can of worms or maybe it's a better question after maybe for NAREIT when hopefully we know who the next President is going to be. But since they singled out migration, it's not a topic that I hear a lot about as a primary demand driver. Is it -- now that maybe we'll have mass deportations, I don't know. But to the extent the migration picture changes, is this a major key variable? Like in 2025, is this going to be a key demand variable potentially where me and the rest of the analysts on the call are writing research reports about this? Or do you think is that wildly overstating the importance of how that trends?
Eric Bolton : I think the influence immigration has on our property performance is a function of two things. It's a function of the markets, obviously. And I would argue that a number of the coastal gateway markets are going to be more influenced by immigration trends than a lot of our Sunbelt markets. Secondly, I would tell you that the price point of your product is going to also be impacted somewhat or is a variable that can be influenced by immigration trends. And we think that a lower price point portfolio is more likely than not to be more at risk from fluctuation with growing or declining levels of immigration. We think that we are not exposed in that way. Over 80% of our portfolio is single. Majority are female. We're serving a resident profile with average incomes of over $80,000, $85,000 a year. I mean, this is not a demographic that we're serving largely in our portfolio that's going to be influenced or impacted one way or the other by changing immigration trends.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Kim from Zelman.
Alex Kim : I wanted to ask about occupancy trends. Same-store occupancy rose 20 basis points sequentially this quarter and I know it stands at 95.4% in October. But can you talk through some of the drivers of the 3Q increase? And with blended rent growth inflecting negatively during the quarter, I mean, when does incremental occupancy become less valuable than rent growth to your revenue strategy?
Tim Argo : I mean, I think as far as the increase in occupancy from Q2 to Q3 is a function of the absorption we talked about and getting more units absorbed than were delivered. And we certainly saw that play out in our portfolio and the majority of our markets saw that sequential gain. We balance pricing and occupancy at a market, submarket property level. I think we're comfortable where we are right now with occupancy at 95.4% primarily because of what we see with exposure that we talked about. We're at a record low exposure, something we haven't seen ever at [ 6.3 ] which what that does is kind of stabilizes where we think occupancy will be over the next 60 days or so and allow this where we can to push on pricing. So exposure is what we look at a little more than occupancy. And it sits in that range. We're certainly comfortable in this 95.4%, 95.5% range and being able to push a little bit on pricing where we can.
Alex Kim : And then just a quick follow-up here. This is now the second quarter [inaudible] that was already in lease-up. Can you talk through just kind of what you're seeing, what you like about that strategy? And it is something that you'll continue employing moving forward?
Brad Hill: You kind of broke up on your question. Can you repeat that last question?
Alex Kim : Yes, sorry. Just asking about your recent activity in buying properties and lease-up. Just curious about that strategy and if it's something you'll continue.
Brad Hill: Yes, absolutely. Our acquisition strategy has been focused on brand new properties in their initial lease-up for the last few years. Again, we just think that there's an opportunity for us to execute in that area, given that it's harder to get to line up financing when a property is not stabilized and our ability to execute all cash is a benefit for us that we're able to really execute driving higher returns, higher NOI yields than what we could get on a fully marketed project that's stabilized. So yes, we'll continue to focus in that area.
Operator: Our last question today will come from Ann Chan from Green Street.
Ann Chan : Just one question for me and keeping on the topic of demand earlier. Amongst your larger markets, particularly where supply continues to pressure pricing, which markets are you underwriting weaker or stronger job growth or in migration on a relative basis?
Tim Argo : Well, certainly, a market that we talked a lot about that on right now, Austin is one that as we think about longer term is one that we're really high on. I mean, we -- in terms of broader trends, we look at migration, we look at household formation. We look at population growth and obviously look at job growth, and Austin is near the top of the list in all of those. So that would be one. Raleigh is another one that we feel strong about. Orlando is one that has had some struggle with supply, but it's got some really strong demand metrics. So most of our footprint, we would be happy to continue to acquire in. But those are two, three markets that I would point out is having some really strong forward-looking demand trends.
Operator: We have no further questions. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks.
Eric Bolton : Okay. No further comments from the company. I appreciate you joining us this morning, and we look forward to seeing many of you out at NAREIT.
Operator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Mid-America Apartment Communities or MAA's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. During management's prepared remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This conference call is being recorded today Thursday, August 1, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening remarks.
Andrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Julianne, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team participating on the call this morning with prepared comments are Eric Bolton, Brad Hill, Tim Argo and Clay Holder. Rob DelPriore and Joe Fracchia are also participating and available for questions as well. Before we begin with prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe Risk Factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial debt. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. Core FFO results for the second quarter were ahead of expectations as the strong demand for apartment housing across our markets is steadily absorbing the new supply being delivered. This strong demand continues to support steady occupancy performance from our portfolio as well as blended lease-over-lease pricing that has consistently increased since Q4 of last year. These positive trends are continuing into July. MAA's strategy has long focused on positioning our portfolio to capture higher full cycle demand to drive superior long-term value growth. To best mitigate the occasional periods of supply pressure, we have a unique portfolio diversification strategy involving both large and mid-tier markets. Further by appealing to a broad segment of the rental market with a more affordable price point, as evidenced by our strong rent income ratios and sector leading low delinquency performance, we believe, we are able to drive higher demand and absorption across our portfolio. We continue to believe that new supply deliveries across our markets are currently peaking and we expect to see the volume of new deliveries decline over the back half of this year with 2025 ushering in a multi-year period where the growing demand for apartment housing will exceed the level of new competing supply. As detailed in yesterday's earnings release, we continue to find compelling opportunities to deploy capital in new acquisitions and development that will, we believe, deliver meaningful earnings accretion over the next few years. Our balance sheet remains strong and well-positioned to deliver on this future value pipeline that we are building. We believe that with the combination of the evolving market conditions poised to decline with the level of new supply delivering across our markets, the redevelopment and repositioning opportunities available to harvest within our existing portfolio, and the new growth pipeline that we're building through in-house development, our pre-purchase program with third-party developers, and the acquisition of newly constructed properties, MAA is positioned for meaningful growth and value over the next few years. Before turning the call over to Brad, Tim, and Clay for more details, I'd like to send my thanks and appreciation to our MAA associates for their dedication and tremendous service to our residents. MAA is capturing record levels of resident retention, high resident satisfaction ratings, and strong lease renewal performance, thanks in large part to your hard work. I'll now turn the call over to Brad.
Brad Hill: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We continue to see solid demand in our markets supported by strong household formation and positive wage and job growth, leading to continued blended pricing momentum in July with stable occupancy. MAA's long-term strategy positions our portfolio as an attractive lower cost alternative to the higher priced new multi-family supply being delivered, as well as the available single-family housing options within our markets. Our renewal accept rates are at a record high and our Google scores continue to lead the sector, evidence of the value our residents find in living with MAA. With the backdoor controlled, we're very focused on the front door and encouraged by the improving traffic trends. Our property tours are higher than this time last year and our conversion of leads into leases is also up. With increased traffic, strong conversion, stable occupancy and lower exposure, our properties are well-positioned as we enter the back half of the year. As indicated in our release, we have made progress using our balance sheet capacity to support future earnings growth. In addition to the two second quarter construction starts that bring our under construction pipeline at the end of the second quarter to 2,617 units at a cost of $866 million. In July, we provided financing to take out the equity partner on a 239 unit under construction development in the SouthPark area of Charlotte. The project suffered an early delay that put the project's investment horizon outside of the equities fund horizon. Our previous relationship with the developer and the equity partner provided us the unique opportunity to invest in an under construction project with no entitlement risk and a materially shortened construction schedule with first units scheduled to deliver in second quarter of 2025. The second quarter development starts -- the two second quarter development starts were expected to deliver first units in mid-2026 and all three projects are expected to deliver average initial stabilized NOI yields around 6.4%, similar to what we are achieving on our current developments that are leasing. While new lease rates are facing slightly more pressure at the moment, rents achieved at our developments are well above our original expectations, driving higher than originally projected NOIs that should deliver stabilized NOI yields that exceed our original expectations by approximately 70 basis points. Pre-development work continues on a number of projects in our pipeline, which has increased to 11 projects, representing additional growth of over 3,100 units. We maintain optionality on when we start these projects, but we expect to start construction on one to two more projects later this year, bringing our development starts for the year to four to five at or slightly above our original guidance for the year and leading to a slight increase in our development spend for the year at $350 million. Construction costs have yet to decline broadly. But we are hopeful that as the current under construction pipeline winds down, we could see more improvement in construction costs and schedules as we progress through the year, supporting our ability to start construction on additional opportunities at compelling yields. In the transaction market, volume remains low with cap rates generally in the low 5% range, with a number of transactions occurring well below 5%. Our team continues to find select but compelling acquisition opportunities generally in lease-up and on an aftermarket base -- on an off-market basis. In the second quarter, we closed on a 306 unit suburban property in Raleigh for approximately $81 million, which is 15% to 20% below replacement costs. This newly constructed property is currently in its initial lease-up and finished the quarter at 62% occupied. We have two additional acquisition opportunities in due diligence and upon successfully concluding our inspections we expect the closings to occur over the next few months. The three acquisitions are expected to deliver stabilized NOI yields on average just under 6%. Based on the activity our team is seeing in the market, we believe, our forecasted acquisition volume of $400 million is achievable. We have two dispositions in the market, one in Charlotte and one in Richmond that we hope to execute on by the end of the year, but we are early in the process. Before I turn the call over to Tim, to all of our associates at the properties in our corporate and regional offices, I want to say thank you for your hard work and dedication that you show on a daily basis to our prospects, residents, and fellow associates. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.
Tim Argo: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As previously referenced, demand in our markets continue to be strong as evidenced by steadily improving lease-over-lease rates on new move-in residents and stable lease-over-lease rates on renewal residents. Pricing growth does continue to be impacted by elevated new supply deliveries, but showed improvement over the first quarter as traffic patterns increased. These factors contributed to new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis of minus 5.1%, with renewal rates for the quarter staying strong, growing 4.6% on a lease-over-lease basis. These two components resulted in lease-over-lease pricing on a blended basis that was an improvement of 70 basis points from the first quarter. Average physical occupancy was 95.5%, up 20 basis points from the first quarter and collections continue to outperform expectations with net delinquency representing just 0.3% of billed rents. All these factors drove the resulting same-store revenue growth of 0.7%. Our unique market diversification strategy that Eric mentioned continues to benefit overall portfolio results. While some of our larger markets are being more heavily impacted by new supply deliveries, many of our mid-tier metros remain steady. Similar to last quarter, Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville are all outperforming the broader portfolio from a blended lease-over-lease pricing standpoint. Our portfolio balance between large and mid-tier markets and diversification of submarkets within the market help strengthen performance through the cycle. Austin, Atlanta and Jacksonville are markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the absolute level of supply being delivered into those markets. While we have slowed some of our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives, in this elevated supply environment, we do continue to execute where it makes sense with the expectation of reaccelerating next year. For the second quarter of 2024, we completed nearly 1,700 interior unit upgrades; achieving rent increases more than 8% above non-upgraded units. For our repositioning program, we have three active projects that are in the repricing phase. We will begin construction on an additional six projects in the third quarter with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025 in what we believe will be an improving leasing environment. With July now wrapped up, we're encouraged by the early third quarter trends. Average physical occupancy for the month of July of 95.5% is in line with second quarter and current occupancy is 95.8%. This stability in occupancy combined with the lower 60-day exposure that Brad noted sets us up for more pricing power for the remainder of the summer as we also start to lap weaker new lease pricing that became evident beginning in August of last year. Accordingly, July, blended pricing of positive 0.3% is up from the first and second quarters and the month of June. And new lease pricing has improved each month since March. Furthermore, the year-over-year change in asking rents for August is expected to be positive for the first time since February of 2023, 18 months ago. As we have discussed over the last few quarters, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets, and it is resulting in prospects shopping longer and being more selective. However, we still believe the long-term outlook is similar to what we discussed last quarter. That is, we expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, but we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease-over-lease pricing growth and that the supply/demand balance continues to improve from here subject to normal seasonality. It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in mid-2022 and we have seen historically that the maximum pressure on leasing is typically about two years after construction start. While supply remains elevated, the strength of demand is evident as well. Absorption in the second quarter in our markets was the highest of any quarter since the third quarter of 2021. Wage growth remained strong with our rent to income ratio in the second quarter dropping a bit to 21%, the lowest level in three years. Additionally, we saw resident turnover continued to decline in the second quarter, and we expect it to remain low with fewer residents moving out to buy a home. The 12.4% of move-outs in the second quarter that were due to resident buying a home was the lowest ever for MAA, slightly lower than what we saw in the first quarter. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Clay.
Clay Holder: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.22 per share, which was $0.03 per share above the mid-point of our second quarter guidance. Just under $0.02 of the favorability was related to favorable same-store expenses and $0.015 was driven by a combination of favorable overhead cost, interest expense, and non-operating income partially offset by about $0.01 in storm cost. Our same-store revenue results for the quarter were essentially in line with expectations. As Tim mentioned, we saw sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement in both blended pricing and occupancy while same-store revenues again benefited from strong rent collections. Our same-store expense performance, particularly in repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and personnel costs was favorable compared to our expectations for the quarter. Repair and maintenance costs continue to show moderation growing at 1.8% compared to second quarter last year. At this point in the year, we have better visibility into our real estate tax expense for 2024, which we will discuss more with our revised guidance in a moment. During the quarter, we funded nearly $80 million of development cost of the current expected $866 million pipeline, leaving an expected $328 million to be funded on this pipeline over the next two years. Considering the Charlotte opportunity and the additional development starts that Brad mentioned and adjusting for those properties we will complete over the remainder of 2024, we expect our development pipeline to grow to just under $1 billion, which our balance sheet is well-positioned to support. During the quarter, we invested approximately $12 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning, and smart rent installation programs, which we expect to produce solid returns and continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We ended the quarter with nearly $1 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund future investments. Our leverage remains low with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.7x. And at quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 93% fixed with an average maturity of 7.4 years at an effective rate of 3.8%. During May, we issued $400 million of seven-year public bonds at an effective rate just below 5.4%, using the proceeds to effectively pay off a $400 million bond maturity in June that had an effective rate of 4%. While our next scheduled bond maturity isn't until the fourth quarter of 2025, we expect to be in the market prior to that date to support ongoing investment opportunities. Finally, we are reaffirming the mid-point of our same-store NOI and core FFO guidance for the year while revising other areas of our detailed guidance that we've previously provided. Given our operating results achieved through the second quarter, we are making slight adjustments to our guidance associated with rent growth and occupancy. We are lowering the mid-point of effective rent growth guidance by 35 basis points to 0.5% and average physical occupancy guidance by 20 basis points to 95.5% for the year. Total same-store revenue guidance for the year was revised to 0.65%, which also reflects stronger expected rent collection performance over the back half of the year. We are lowering our property operating expense growth projections for the year to 4.25% at the mid-point. As previously mentioned we have better insight into our real estate tax expense for 2024 and have lowered the mid-point of our guidance to 4%. The lower guidance is primarily due to favorable Texas property valuations as compared to our original expectations. Also, we renewed our property and casualty insurance program on July 1 and have achieved a combined premium decrease of around 1%. The changes to our property operating expense projections, combined with our updated same-store revenue expectations, results and reaffirming our original expectation for same-store NOI at negative 1.3%. In addition to updating our same-store operating projections, we were revising our 2024 guidance to reflect favorable trends in G&A and interest expense. As Brad previously mentioned, we also increased the mid-point of our development spend to $350 million. The impact of these adjustments, combined with the $0.03 of expected storm costs associated with Hurricane Beryl in the third quarter, resulted in us maintaining the mid-point of our full year core FFO guidance at $8.88 per share on narrowing the range of $8.74 to $9.02 per share. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Julianne, we will now turn the call back to you for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Eric Wolfe from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Eric Wolfe: Hey, thanks. I was hoping you could discuss your seasonality assumptions and what you're expecting for the fourth quarter this year versus what you saw last year.
Tim Argo: Eric, can you repeat that a little -- I lost you a little bit there at the beginning.
Eric Wolfe: Sure. I was hoping you could discuss your seasonality assumptions and what you expect for the fourth quarter this year.
Tim Argo: Okay. Got you. Yes, I mean, I think from a seasonality standpoint, we've seen it play out kind of like we thought so far where we continue to see some acceleration through about this time of the year. And then I think as we get later into the fall and winter, we'll see that normal seasonality. Now having said that, and I alluded to it a little bit in my opening comments. We're in a really good spot right now with our current occupancy. We're in a good spot with exposure lower than what it was this time last year. And so we feel like with what we're seeing particularly, I mentioned to the asking rents for August are a little bit higher than what they were this time 12 months ago. It's the first time we've seen that 18 months. So I'd see that all to say, I think the normal seasonality, could extend out a little bit longer. July is typically when it peaks in a normal seasonality. We think that could extend for a month or six weeks or two months and then start to moderate as we get into the back half of the year. But the adjustments we made to the pricing guidance was really just on new lease pricing, and most of that was -- would occurred in the second quarter. We made a couple of minor tweaks to Q3 and Q4, but essentially held our expectations for what we saw for that. So net-net, it was really about a 100 basis point decrease in our new lease pricing assumption renewals holding steady, and that seasonality is standing out a little bit more than it typically would.
Eric Wolfe: Thanks. That's helpful. And then it looks like your guidance includes some uplift from other revenues. Could you just talk about what the opportunity looks like there and whether that contribution could potentially increase as we go into 2025.
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean I think it's not a huge piece. I mean, it's growing a little bit more than rents currently with where our occupancy is there's fee income, application fee, that sort of thing. So it's providing a little bit, nothing out of the ordinary, I think, in a normal environment, it would be somewhat in line with rents. I mean, we do have some opportunities over the long-term with Wi-Fi -- ubiquitous Wi-Fi that we're testing this year. And I think over the next several years that will be a big opportunity for us, but nothing material necessarily in the short-term.
Eric Wolfe: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Nick Yulico: Thank you. I just wanted to see, I think, I don't know if you gave this, apologies. But is there a way to get just sort of the blended lease pricing that is assumed to the back half of the year? I know you said you adjusted in the full year; I just want to make sure we're clear on that.
Tim Argo: Yes. So for blended for the back half of the year, we're on average were I would say this, for full year new lease we're somewhere in the 4.25% range, which is about 100 basis points lower than what it was in our original guidance. And we're still in that mid-4 to 5 range on renewals. And so somewhere in the 0.5% to 1% blended in the back half of the year is how that plays out.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just second question is, you talked about some of the markets where you're seeing more impact from supply, Austin, Atlanta, Jacksonville. As you look at some of the supply deliveries or what's happening with competitive concessions in those markets. I mean do you have any sort of visibility right now when you think some of those markets would be not as much of a drag on overall new lease pricing? Thanks.
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean, I think all those markets are in somewhat of a similar timeline, saw similar peak and starts and deliveries that frankly, pretty consistent across the portfolio where we saw start peak in mid-2022 and kind of seeing the peak of it right now. So market like Austin still going to be elevated next year, not going to be quite as much supply as we had this year. Job growth is really strong. So I mean, I think for all three of those, in particular, I would expect 2025 to look better than what it does in 2024. It's not going to flip to be in our lead markets, but I think it will be more in line with the portfolio and be less of a drag in 2025 for sure.
Nick Yulico: And just a quick follow-up on that. I mean, is there anything you're seeing just on the ground right now that would point to some of that concessionary impact already easing? Or is it still a wait and see?
Tim Argo: Well, we haven't seen it get worse. We saw concessions pick up quite a bit in the back part of 2023 and then come back down, I would say, at early 2024 and then pretty steady throughout 2024. Somewhere -- broadly somewhere between half a month and a month is pretty consistent across markets. There are some pockets with more lease-ups, Downtown Austin probably closer to two months. Midtown Atlanta probably our worst concessionary environment right now, sometimes pushing three months where there's lease-ups, but not really any heavier than it was the last couple of quarters. And I think we're in a much more stable environment, both in terms of interest rates and when the supply picture is going to start to look better. So I don't see that necessarily getting any worse from here.
Eric Bolton: And Nick, this is Eric. Just to follow on what Tim is saying, last -- late last year in the fourth quarter, there was a lot of uncertainty out there surrounding the demand side of the business and the overall economy and the job market and the supply delivery is really starting to make an impact. And I think that, that's what prompted a lot of pretty aggressive concessionary practices in the marketplace late last year. But as the year has continued to unfold, I think we've all been pleasantly surprised with the very strong demand that we continue to see taking place. Stability is more evident than I think people initially feared it was possible, and as a consequence of the strong demand that we're seeing and clear visibility that new supply deliveries are poised to start declining. I think the market is starting to feel a little bit more comfortable with the practices I have and the lease-up programs I have in place.
Nick Yulico: Thanks, Eric, Tim. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Josh Dennerlein: Yes. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to touch based on the insurance renewal looked pretty favorable versus maybe what you were forecasting before. Just kind of any changes to maybe what you're covering or just any kind of color on how you got that pretty decent renewal.
Rob DelPriore: Yes, hi, Josh, this is Rob. I guess kind of framing it up, if you look at the last three years of insurance renewals in the aggregate, our costs have gone up about 50%. And we've had some good positive claims here. We've got long relationships -- positive relationships with our insurers. So I think given the claims history and where this wound up, we wound up with the same coverage levels that we had last year. And we just -- we caught a break with a kind of stabilizing insurance market and favorable claims history.
Josh Dennerlein: Okay. All right. Great. And then on the real estate taxes, are there -- is there any more variability across the rest of the year? Or you kind of locked in at this point for the back half on real estate taxes? And then just how should we think about like maybe the cadence from here? I think some of the states have like different assessment times. So just trying to think through like maybe some kind of lag on a go-forward basis?
Clay Holder: Hey Josh, this is Clay. Yes, I think we have pretty good visibility across the portfolio at this point with the exception of Florida. And that's the one -- that's the one state that typically lags the rest. I think keep in mind now that Florida has a cap on their valuations. And so we have a pretty good idea of where they'll ultimately end up. We just don't have the final valuation onto at this point. The other missing piece is around the millage rates. And that's fairly across the Board. But we, again, kind of same story with Florida property valuations. We have pretty good visibility as to what we think that those will be as we wrap up the rest of this year.
Josh Dennerlein: All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It sounds like the adjustments to the guidance reflects the pressure in the first half and the original assumptions for the second half remain relatively unchanged. So what gives you confidence in that just given seasonal slowing trends and also elevated supply? Thanks.
Tim Argo: Yes, this is Tim. And I mentioned a couple on that. I think, one, we're at a really good spot from an occupancy exposure standpoint. As we said here this time last year, we were a little bit more of a hole in terms of occupancy and exposure. We're in a better spot this year. And I think, frankly, a couple of things that I didn't mention in the prior question is about mid-July of last year is when new lease rates really started to drop off, they hit sort of a cliff there in mid-July and continue that way through December. So that frankly creates an easier comp scenario for us as well. So now as we sit here at the beginning of August, we're starting to lap some of those comparisons. And then I think as we've said, too, we do expect the impact from supply to start to moderate a little bit in the back part of the year. I mean it won't manifest itself too much with seasonality. But we were in a period of increasing supply this time last year, while we think we're in a little bit of a period of decreasing price from supply this year. So I think where we are with occupancy exposure the comps, the supply situation, and the continued demand turnover being low, more of our mixes and renewals, which continues to be our strongest point for pricing. Rent to income continuing to be solid. So don't see any change on the demand scenario either other than some of the normal seasonality that we'll see later this year.
Michael Goldsmith: Thanks for that. And my follow-up question is on the renewals. How are they trending at an ask versus take rate basis? Thanks.
Tim Argo: Yes. So we were at 4% in June. We're actually 4% -- or in July, sorry, the next couple of months, August, September, where we expect to be in the 4% to 4.5% range with actually September being more towards the higher end of that range. So we're seeing -- and on top of that, our renewal accept rates are higher than they were last year, really higher than they've been in the last few years. So continue to see strength there and expect that to hold up pretty well through the rest of the year.
Michael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in the back half.
Tim Argo: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. I just want to talk some more about the development opportunities. I appreciate your comments of ramping up to $1 billion of potential spend. I think a lot of people are excited about all the major pullback in starts and what 2026, 2027 could look like in your markets. Can you talk more about how much more you think you could ramp up? Is the land already on your balance sheet? Would you need to go out and buy it? And just kind of how large and how would you fund as you throttle up the development pipeline?
Brad Hill: Yes. Jamie, this is Brad. As we've said in the past, we would feel comfortable given our balance sheet strength and size really ramping up our development pipeline to about 4% to 5% of our enterprise value, which would take our pipeline to call it, $1 billion to $1.2 billion, and that's really what we've been working with over the last few years. We -- this time in 2022, our pipeline was about $450 million. And today, we've almost doubled that. So we feel really good about the trajectory that we're on. We do have -- as I mentioned in my comments, we've got a sufficient pipeline of owned and controlled sites on our balance sheet. We've got about 11 projects now that that we currently control. A number of those would be ready to start very quickly if construction costs come down or rents improve sufficiently enough to drive the returns up to where we think they need to be. So we've got a good pipeline ahead of us. We're in a really good spot. And Clay, I'll let you handle the other part of that question.
Clay Holder: Yes. Jamie, I'll add on to that as far as where we think that, that funding would come from, I mean, where we would look to first is to fund that through additional debt, given our leverage at the 3.7x. And so we would look to move that up at least to the 4.5x or maybe 5x. And that's a significant number. That's almost over $1 billion. So we've got plenty of opportunity there of how we would go about funding that. Especially in an environment where rates will -- we expect would continue to decline over the next year or so.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on that. So you mentioned if construction costs decline, I mean where do you -- what line items are you watching the most to see if they pull back, where would that be the most helpful.
Brad Hill: Certainly, we don't need a lot of decrease in construction cost because the other piece of the puzzle, I think, that we're likely to see a little bit of improvement on is on the schedules side of things, which has extended a bit over the last few years just given the amount of product that's in the pipeline. So we don't need construction costs to come down a whole lot to make some of these projects feasible or to get the economics more in line. But -- and we have seen that. The project that we started in Charlotte in the second quarter, we saw construction costs come down a few million dollars. So we don't need it to come down a lot. I think where you're likely to see that is some of the margins for some of the contractors out there. We've seen those margins -- profit margins increased substantially over the last couple of years. I think framing and lumber and things of that nature are down right now. So I'm not sure you'll get a whole lot of that, but I think it's going to come from some of the margins.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. And then also, as we think about your historically low turnover, do you expect to maintain that kind of retention and renewal pricing power in a potentially lower interest rate environment despite some of the pent-up demand for homeownership. We're just trying to understand some of the key drivers that could pull that number back. And I don't know if it's in your surveys that you get when people move out or just your own tens of cycles. Is it -- is there a certain mortgage rate, we think will make a difference? Or just how are you guys thinking about it over the next year or so, if rates continue to decline or do decline?
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean, we certainly track the reason for move out as part -- when somebody does move out and track those reasons where they're trending. And certainly, the decrease and move out to my home has been helpful to overall turnover decreasing. So I mean, I do think it will tick back up if and when rates start to drop. I mean, it's still it probably needs to be a fairly material drop. If you think about single-family home prices even ignoring the level of interest rates. Those have continued to go up even as rents have started to moderate. And so with current interest rates, somebody buying a house is going to be -- their average payment is going to be about 40% to 50% higher than our average rent. So to fill that gap, it would take quite a decrease in interest rates. So I do expect at some point, turnover pick up a little bit, but usually when that happens, if interest rates are dropping, people buy in homes that typically speaks to a pretty strong economy as well. So we typically see that hold up okay as rents start to move as a part of that. So I don't think it would be as big of a -- I don't think it would be a one-for-one trade-off. It would have some benefits on the revenue side as well.
Eric Bolton: And Jamie, this is Eric. I'll add to what Tim said. Right now, the median house principal interest payment in our markets is about 40% higher on average than our average rent. So there is a pretty significant modification or moderation in the purchase of single-family housing that's going to have to take place before I think we get back to the level of turnover that we saw going back four or five years ago, I think that we've been in a steady decline of resident turnover for quite a few years. And I think it will likewise take a few years to get back to perhaps where we were some years ago.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. Great. Thanks for your thoughts.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Anderson from Wedbush. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Richard Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. So if you can help me sort of marry a few things here. It sounded very optimistic looking out beyond the near-term supply maximum impact to new lease is behind you, as you said, and August is looking good, yet you lowered your new lease rate guidance. I'm just curious, is this kind of like final hurdle to clear type of thing or the beatable situation in the back half of this year? I'm just curious if you can sort of bring those two pieces together for me?
Tim Argo: Yes. I'll comment just on the new lease rate piece. I mean, it was -- the biggest modification, if you will was the Q2 new lease rates being a little bit lower than what we had initially dialed in. And as I commented just people shopping a little longer, being a little more selective in this elevated environment, we tweaked new lease rate -- the cadence of new lease rates a little bit in the back half of the year, but I do think, as I said, that seasonality extends out a little more. So really, the impact to our -- to the revenue guidance and the new lease pricing was primarily what occurred in Q2, then you obviously had that carried over in the back half of the year, whereas as good or better new lease rates in the back half don't impact quite as much as the current year but certainly play into 2025.
Richard Anderson: Okay. Great. And then the second question is, when you think about kind of looking into 2025, just in your experience and history in dealing with pockets of supply that have happened in your careers many times you're accustomed to this. How does the cadence of 2025 kind of look when you think about what you know is coming to be delivered and then the tail of that as it leases up does 2025 sort of hit the ground running? Or is it sort of a slow evolution and you don't really get back to a real growth story of significance until a year into the year, if that makes sense.
Tim Argo: Yes, it does. I mean, I think the seasonality will be pretty typical and there will still be supply pressure next year. It's going to be less in, but it's not nothing. It's still going to be there. So I think what you'll see play out as -- particularly as we get into the spring and summer, that we'll start to see the new lease rates accelerate. We'll see that blended lease-over-lease improve, but that's going to obviously take 12 months kind of feed through all the leases. So what I would expect is to start to see some pricing power on blended lease-over-lease in spring, summer 2025 and then really not hugely play out in terms of revenue growth until you get late 2025 into 2026. And I think it really sets up for a good earn-in into 2026 and then even less supply pressure there where you really start to see that revenue growth pick up late 2025 and into 2026.
Richard Anderson: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes. Thanks, everybody. And piggyback a little bit off the last question there, Tim, and circling back to Tim's comments on asking rents turning positive in August. I guess with comps easing from here, what's sort of your expectation for the trend in asking rents through this year and into 2025 and maybe seasonality aside later this year, when do you expect positive asking rents to translate into positive new lease rate growth?
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean I think similar probably gets into early mid next year. I mean, we have seen if you want to use kind of our new lease rates as a proxy for market rents. We have seen with where July new lease rents were about 4% or so higher than we were at the beginning of the year. So it's certainly closing that gap. And I don't -- it will moderate some in the winter time with the seasonality. But I would think probably it's going to be kind of spring, early summer that we start to see that manifest itself into positive new lease rates would be my guess.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then I guess with this move in asking rents, where does that put the portfolio today from a loss or gain to lease perspective?
Tim Argo: If you look -- so if you look, be clear on how I'm defining this, if you look at all the leases we did in July, it's about 2% higher, so 2% loss to lease compared to our in-place rents. Certainly, we're sitting at kind of the peak demand, if you will, or the peak pricing and a typical seasonality. So I think that edges back down a little bit later in the year, but it's about 2% right now.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. Thanks for the time.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Kim: Thank you. Tim, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned absorption is the highest it's been since the third quarter of 2021. And I'm wondering what's driving this. A few years ago, we did have the strong net migration trends to your markets, but that seems to have softened a bit. So I just wanted to know what do you think is driving demand right now?
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean I think it's a little bit a lot of factors. I mean we have -- job growth has been a little bit stronger. We still have certainly stronger job growth in our markets than the broader nationally. And even within migration, we saw it tick back up a little bit at 12% of our move-ins were from out of our footprint in Q2 into MAA, which is ticked up a little bit and back to where it was about 12 months ago, continue to see wage growth and population growth, household formation and then just the turnover being quite a bit lower, obviously, as well helps in that absorption as there's less existing units, if you will, to be absorbed that that spreads out into those new units coming online. So the absorption has been strong now for several quarters. It's keeping up, if you will, with the new supply, which is why we don't think it gets worse. But I think all those factors that I mentioned are combining to help drive that demand.
John Kim: Okay. And I wanted to clarify your views on renewal rates. So you had 4.5% to 5% in the first half of the year. That's what you're expecting in the second half of the year. I think that's the answer you gave to Nick Yulico. But July opined to 4%. So I'm wondering why this month was relatively lower than what you're expecting. And are you basically expecting this to ramp up in the fourth quarter?
Tim Argo: Well, I mean, we have 4% to 5% is kind of our full year expectation. We are on the higher end of that in the first half of the year. I think, probably a little bit lower end of that in the back half of the year. But we are seeing, I think, August probably is a little better than July and September is trending a little bit better than August. So I do think as we get into the back part of the year, I mean, our renewals have always held up pretty strong. And with new lease rates increasing that that gap between the two has started to narrow a bit. So I think, again, with the easier comps, I think that will tend to help renewals as well. But -- so I think you start to trend a little bit more towards that 4.5% as you get right at the back quarter in late Q4.
John Kim: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. So first one, I guess, is on the transaction market cap rates. Seemed like early this year, cap rates were closer to 6%. Now we're getting into the low 5%. Interest rates coming down a bit more I wouldn't necessarily call it confidence or clarity, but a better feeling of how fundamentals could be trending in the Sunbelt over the next 6, 12 months. I'm curious. Are sellers now more willing to engage in not only conversations about selling assets? Do you expect the cap rate to be lower from here? And then some color on how you're underwriting IRRs for the assets you bought in the second quarter. Thanks.
Brad Hill: Yes, Haendel, this is Brad. I think, certainly, the cap rates that we're seeing in the market are kind of in that 5% range, which, frankly, has been consistent for the last couple of quarters. I think we saw cap rates tick up a little bit in the fourth quarter of last year, and that's since come down around that 5% mark. So given where the expectations are with interest rates and some of the market not being quite as uncertain as it was last year. I mean I would expect cap rates to kind of stay in that range going forward. There is a lot of optimism as we've talked about in 2026/2027 fundamentals. And so that's certainly being reflected a bit in the transaction market. Interest rates today are, call it, in that 5.5%, 5.75% range. So there is a little bit of negative leverage that folks are willing to accept when there's growth on the horizon. So that's kind of where we're seeing cap rates today. In terms of where we're underwriting deals and the IRRs that we're looking at. So based on our kind of long-term cost of capital, our levered IRR hurdles, call it, 8%. Most of our acquisitions are delivering substantially more than that. North of that, just to remind you, we're not buying at 5 caps. The acquisitions that we've executed on and the ones that we have under contract today or in the NOI yields high 5%, close to 6% range. So we're not active at a 5 cap at the moment. But given where our cost of capital is we're achieving yields and IRRs substantially above our current cost of capital.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Very helpful. You mentioned in your comments earlier that the rent to income in the portfolios around, I think you said 21%, the lowest in three years. I was curious if you're sensing any rent fatigue, any change in the move-outs due to rents you're seeing in the portfolio? And then can you add some color on concessions usage in the portfolio today, how that compares to last quarter or last year? Thanks.
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean we did see rent income drop in Q2, and that's based on all the residents that moved in, in Q2. And we track move-in -- our move-ins or move-outs due to rent increase is certainly down significantly. So I think that and the move-outs to buy a house are the two components that are driving the lower turnover as rental started to moderate. But on the concession question, pretty consistent for us as a portfolio, it's very minimal; somewhere in the 0.5% to 1% of overall rent is our concession practice. But as I alluded to a little bit earlier, I'd say, broadly, kind of half a month to month is pretty typical in most markets. There are a few pockets where you might see two where there's some lease-up scenarios, and I mentioned Midtown Atlanta is probably our worst we might see two to three kind of uptown South and Charlotte, kind of in that two-month range in downtown Austin in that two-month range. Those are the three pockets I would say; we're seeing a little bit higher concession usage. But overall, pretty consistent with what we've seen in the last -- all throughout 2024 I would say.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. And one last one, I appreciate the commentary on the insurance costs coming in the commentary in the marketplace. So I'm curious if there's anything that perhaps you're doing any differently in your approach if you're perhaps self-insuring a bit more? Thanks.
Rob DelPriore: Hey Haendel, it's Rob again. Yes, our retentions are all the same as they were last year, one exception. We did have to increase our retention by $250,000 on our general liability to kind of our slip and fall protection there, just kind of got some pressure from the insurance companies to do that. But the rest of everything stayed the same in terms of what we're doing on retentions.
Haendel St. Juste: Great. Thanks, guys, and best of luck.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning, down there. Two questions. The first is bad debt. Can you just talk a bit about your resident credit profile now versus pre-pandemic? Are you back to where you were pre-pandemic? And if there are any markets in particular that are still elevated and thoughts on why any elevated markets are remain as such?
Tim Argo: Yes. We're mostly back to pre-pandemic level. I mean I think we're probably on average over the long-term, 10 to 15 bps higher in terms of delinquency than where we consistently were pre-COVID but you're talking about 0.3 to 0.4 maybe up to 0.5% of rent. So it's still very low for us and not much of an issue. Atlanta is the market has been talked about a lot that has had more pressure. We actually saw that drop to about 0.5% of rents in Q2 down from about 1.3% where it was a year ago. So I think the practices we've put in place to try to sort of catch that fraud before they come in the front door, and it's starting to play out and help us there. So outside of that, not a lot of pressure across portfolio, and it continues to be mostly a non-issue for us.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And just confirming what you said. You said normal bad debt is 30 to 40 bps and currently, you're 15 above that. I just want to make sure I heard that right.
Tim Argo: Well, I would say, our delinquency in Q2, I think was around 0.3% or 0.4%. There's a little bit of seasonality too. I would say pre-COVID, longer-term, delinquency was somewhere in the 0.3 range. I would guess, long-term in this new environment is probably between 0.4, 0.5 roughly.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then second question is a lot of discussion on the call about the changes in your same-store assumptions changes in rent profile and occupancy. And yet big picture is your FFO mid-point stayed the same and that's despite $0.03 hurricane charge in the third quarter. So I mean it sounds like there's a lot of focus on same-store, but ultimately to earnings, it's almost a non-issue. So what's the best way you gave a lot of stats on rents, on revenue, occupancy, et cetera? But ultimately, it matters what you guys deliver on the bottom line. So what's really the key focus or the key driver of the FFO versus all these puts and takes?
Clay Holder: Yes. Alex, just a couple of points that I would make. I mean, obviously, the revenue plays into that. And so as we kind of dial those in and adjusted for that first half performance and what it's going to look like in the back half of the year, and then achieving what we were looking forward for the back half of the year. Those will all play into that from a revenue standpoint. We feel good about all that. That feels very achievable and for all the reasons that Tim previously mentioned, we feel like that's in a good spot. And you kind of get down into the operating expense section, we talked about the real estate taxes and the insurance renewal. Those are really kind of -- those two things are really offsetting the changes that we have adjusted for and the revenue guidance. And so if you look back at kind of where we've been running and trending in personal costs, repair and maintenance costs started with the first half of the year, there is potential upside there. We've -- but we'll see how that plays out. But those two things can really talking to each other and offsetting one another, then it just gets down into below the line there. And then there's been some favorable G&A costs, interest expense, and some other items that's really offsetting that $0.03 that we noted for the hurricane during the third quarter.
Alexander Goldfarb: Yes. And overall --
Eric Bolton: Alex, this is Eric. Just to add to what Clay is saying. I mean, what really drives FFO performance long-term is NOI. And as you point out, I mean, a lot of gives and takes and lot of details that we dig into and the market most part trying to understand sort of what's driving that NOI. But for me, sort of the key takeaway is that in the midst of clearly what sort of record levels of new supply coming into our market. And we kind of feel like we're in the worst of the storm right now. We think that we're seeing sort of bottoming out occurring as it relates to sort of what's happening with new lease pricing. And we think that, particularly as you get into next year, we think that new lease price is going to hang in there. Next year, we think it starts to really take off. It will take a while for it to really build into revenues and ultimately into NOI just because of seasonal factors. But when you look at what's happening with new lease pricing and recognizing we're kind of the worst of the storm now, renewal pricing is hanging in there, and we do think that we are likely going to see continued relief on the overall operating expense side of the business as a function of some of the new technology we continue to introduce as well as inflationary pressures beginning to moderate. So ultimately, what really drives FFO is NOI, same-store NOI. And we think that when you look at the variables that make up that NOI performance, we think that it's poised to really show some recovery over the next few years.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Adam Kramer: Great. Thanks. I want to ask about the delta between the commenced and the signed leases in July?
Tim Argo: Say that again, the delta between what?
Adam Kramer: Yes. Just between the leases that were signed in July and the leases that were commenced or effective in July, what you reported?
Tim Argo: There's about a 50 basis point delta. So I mean, obviously, with sign, you've got some that will go in effect into that month and some that will go effect later, could be ones that end up getting canceled. So we don't -- we frankly don't pay a ton of attention to sign, but that's what the delta is.
Adam Kramer: That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about some of capital allocation from a high level, maybe a little bit of focus on this call on development and maybe the possibility of leaning a little bit more into that. So I guess, just kind of given kind of where acquisitions and cap rates are today and maybe that market showing some green shoots given the development opportunity that you talked about, how would you kind of stack rank those two and any other kind of capital allocation opportunities and priorities.
Brad Hill: Yes, Adam, this is Brad. Well, I think our plan from a capital allocation perspective is to certainly continue to allocate both to acquisition and development. We would like to lean a little bit more into the acquisition area given just the immediacy of earnings associated with that. But honestly, given the returns that we've been able to achieve, where our yields are 6% and the market was substantially less than that, we've been a little bit slower in the acquisition market, I still feel good about our guidance for the year at $400 million development. Again, we've seen opportunities there that have really come up. We've got additional opportunities that we're looking at where developers -- third-party developers are not able to get their financing lined up. And so we're seeing additional opportunities come to us through that area. So I wouldn't be surprised if in the short-term we do find additional development opportunities versus acquisition. But from a long-term perspective, we like both of those avenues. And I think generally, they'll be pretty evenly split in terms of the acquisition in development on our spend on a yearly basis.
Adam Kramer: Great. Thanks for the time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning. My question is more from a regulatory perspective. Again, you have President Biden up there kind of talking about implementing further rent control. We're going into an election cycle. Just curious what you think about that? And specifically, if you're also kind of hearing anything in any of your key states where you have exposure about potential rent control laws and kind of going into this current election cycle.
Rob DelPriore: Hi Omotayo, it's Rob. I'll start off, I guess, with President Biden's 5% rent control proposal. And we do think that there's some election year politicking going on there. It does require an active Congress that in this year with the divided Congress. We don’t really see that -- that, that particular effort will gain a lot of traction at the federal level and then following-up on your state-level question. 13 of the states where we operate that represents about 90% of our NOI as a state-level prohibition on local rent control. So we're really not seeing any movement at the state level. And in most of the instances, it's blocked at the local level. So in terms of rent control, we're not that concerned about the impact of rent control on our markets.
Omotayo Okusanya: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ann Chan from Green Street. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ann Chan: Hey, good morning. Quick question for me. Do you expect a reacceleration in growth of any expense line items heading into next year?
Clay Holder: This is Clay. We kind of look at it next year, we think that, that property taxes, I'll start there since it's the biggest line item. But the property taxes will continue to run in this 3% to 4% range as we've adjusted our guidance is at 4% today. We think it can run probably in there for a period of time, especially given what we've seen and just for the property performance over these past couple of years given the high supply and seeing some of those income levels come down from those properties. Insurance, we saw -- we had our renewal this year, so we'll enjoy a little bit of that going into the first half of next year as well. And then it will be another negotiation at that point. And look, I wouldn't expect it to be necessarily another decrease by any stretch, but I also don't know that we would expect to see levels of what we saw in the couple of -- past couple of years of 15%, 20%. So I think it would be a much more reasonable growth with that level, assuming claims experience stays pretty effective with what they've been for us in the past. And then looking at personnel costs, repair and maintenance, marketing costs and those types of items, we think that those will continue to run at a pretty normal rate. We've seen some moderation in all those mix categories over the past year. And so we would think that those -- we would definitely would expect those to jump to a level of what they were going around 2021, 2022. So big more of the 3% to 4% growth range there.
Ann Chan: Thanks. And second question, Tim, can you share what your expectations are for new lease growth in Atlanta for this year? And when you believe the markets will start seeing a stronger rate and occupancy trends?
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean, Atlanta has been pretty -- new lease rates has been pretty consistently high-single-digits in the negative -- high negative single-digits in the negative 8% to 9% range. We've seen it improve a little bit the last couple of months, and we've seen a little bit of traction in occupancy in July for Atlanta. So I think it will follow a similar trend in terms of the slowly getting better and starting to show some signs as we get into 2025, but probably take a little while for that one to get back to positive, a little bit longer than some of the other markets we're looking at.
Ann Chan: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our last question will come from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Linda Tsai: Yes. Hi, where are you sending out renewals for August? And what are you getting for those? And how does that compare to last year and historically?
Tim Argo: So for both August, September, we're getting in the 4% to 4.5% range. We sent out around 4% and depending on who accepts and what lease term. That's how you can get a variance there. But -- so I think this time last year, it was somewhere around 4.5% to 5%, so we're a little bit shy of that, but expect to be in that 4% to 4.5% range for a period of time.
Linda Tsai: And then with rent to income dropping to 21%, do you track how much average incomes of your residents have increased over the past few years?
Tim Argo: Yes, we do. It is -- so right now, in Q2, we're about $91,000 or so is the average income that was -- if I go back to beginning of -- kind of right at the beginning of COVID, beginning of 2020, it was about $75,000. So it has trended up quite a bit and generally followed rent growth pretty well because as we said, that rent income ratio has been between, call it, 20% and 23% for the last four or five years. So it's pretty consistent across the market. I think our highest is 24% our lowest is 19%. So it's pretty consistent across markets as well.
Linda Tsai: Thanks.
Operator: We have no further questions. I will turn the call to MAA for closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: Okay. No further comments and we appreciate everyone joining us reach out if you have any other questions you'd like to ask. Thanks very much.
Operator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Mid-America Apartment Communities or MAA's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session.
 [Operator Instructions]
 This conference call is being recorded today. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments. 
Andrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team participating on the call this morning with prepared comments are Eric Bolton, Brad Hill, Tim Argo and Clay Holder. DelPriore and Joe Fracchia are also participating and available for questions as well.
 Before we begin with prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results.
 During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial debt.
 Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions.
 I will now turn the call over to Eric. 
H. Bolton: Thanks, Andrew, and performance trends in the first quarter were in line with our expectations, and we enter the summer leasing season well positioned. Pricing trends for new resident move-ins continue to reflect the impact from new supply delivering in several of our markets.
 Our renewal pricing remained strong. Encouragingly, blended lease-over-lease pricing in the first quarter captured 100 basis points improvement as compared to the prior quarter, followed by April pricing that was ahead of the first quarter performance. While the bulk of the leasing year is still in front of us, we do like our early positioning as we head into the summer leasing season.
 We continue to believe that our high-growth markets are producing solid demand sufficient to absorb the new supply in a steady manner that will enable continued stable occupancy, strong renewal pricing, strong collections and overall revenue results that are aligned with the outlook that we provided in our prior guidance.
 Our leasing traffic remains strong and record low resident turnover, favorable net migration trends and stable employment conditions across our diversified portfolio and markets continue to drive solid demand. While we expect leasing conditions will remain pressured by new supply deliveries through the year, our on-site teams actively supported by our asset management group are doing a terrific job.
 Superior Resident Services as reflected by our sector-leading Google ratings and record-high resident retention rates, along with several new technology capabilities introduced over the past couple of years are making a meaningful difference in this competitive environment. With new supply deliveries poised to begin tapering later this year, demand trends remaining stable and occupancy remaining strong, we remain optimistic that leasing conditions should recover quickly and begin improving in early 2025.
 While the transaction market remains slow, we are seeing more acquisition opportunities for new lease-up projects, which Brad will touch on in his comments, and we remain comfortable with our transaction expectation for the year.
 I continue to be optimistic about our ability to work through the current supply cycle with in our high-growth markets ability to absorb new supply. With a 30-year performance record focused on these high-growth markets, we've operated through prior supply cycles.
 Today, we believe our diversified and higher-quality portfolio, our stronger operating platform our stronger balance sheet have us positioned to compete at an even higher level. We're excited about the outlook over the next few years.
 Our high-growth markets continue to offer attractive long-term appeal for employers, households and real estate investors. We have a meaningful future growth on the horizon as new supply deliveries decline and leasing conditions strengthen. Several new technology initiatives will drive further efficiencies and higher operating margins from our existing portfolio and a pipeline of redevelopment opportunities will also drive higher rent growth from our existing properties.
 And finally, our external growth pipeline continues to expand, setting the stage for a meaningful additional NOI growth. I'd like to send my appreciation to our MAA team for a solid start to 2024.
 And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad. 
Brad Hill: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. In preparation for what we believe will be a stronger leasing environment in 2025 through at least 2028, we continue to make progress in putting our balance sheet capacity to work to deliver future earnings growth.
 Subsequent to quarter end, we started construction on a 302-unit prepurchase development in Charlotte, North Carolina, and we expect to start construction this quarter on a 345-unit project under our prepurchase development platform in the Phoenix, Arizona MSA.
 Both projects are expected to deliver first units by mid-2026, and deliver stabilized NOI yields in the mid-6% range consistent with what we are achieving on our current developments that are leasing.
 With the addition of these two projects, our active development pipeline represents 2,617 units at a total cost of approximately $866 million. With continued interest rate volatility and tight credit conditions, transaction volume remains low. But we have seen cap rates firm up a bit from fourth quarter with market cap rates on deals we track that closed in the first quarter, averaging approximately 5.1%, 30 basis points lower than the previous quarter.
 Despite the low transaction volume, our team continues to find compelling select acquisition opportunities. We currently have an off-market 306-unit suburban property in Raleigh under contract to acquire for approximately $81 million that we expect to close this month. This newly constructed property is currently in its initial lease up at 49% occupancy and is expected to stabilize in mid- to late 2025.
 At this point, we believe our forecasted acquisition volume of $400 million is achievable. Despite the increased pressure from new supply, our 4 developments that are actively leasing 3 of which are under construction and 1 that has completed and is in lease-up continue to deliver good performance.
 While new lease rates are facing slightly more pressure at the moment with concessions on select units, up from 4 weeks to 6 weeks, we continue to achieve rents on average approximately 18% above our original expectations, driving higher than originally projected NOI and earnings and creating additional long-term shareholder value.
 For these 4 projects, we expect to achieve an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.5%, exceeding our original expectations by 70 basis points. We continue to make progress on the predevelopment work for a number of projects. In addition to the two 2nd quarter development starts I mentioned a moment ago, we expect to start construction on one to two more projects later this year.
 While we have not seen a broad reduction in construction costs, encouragingly, we have achieved some level of reduction on our recent pricing supporting our ability to start construction on these projects. We have seen better subcontractor bid participation, which we expect to lead to better execution with stronger subs throughout the construction process for our new starts.
 We are hopeful that the significant drop in construction starts that we've seen in our region will lead to more substantial construction cost declines. As we progress through the year, allowing us to start construction on additional opportunities in our development pipeline, which today consists of 10 well-located sites that we either own or control, representing additional growth of nearly 2,800 units.
 We maintain optionality on when we start these projects, allowing us to remain patient and disciplined in our execution timing. Any project we start this year will deliver first units in 2026 and 2027 aligning with what is likely to be a strong leasing environment, supported by significantly lower supply.
 Our development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this liquidity-constrained environment, it's possible we could add additional in-house and prepurchase development opportunities to our current and future pipeline.
 While we continue to pursue numerous external growth opportunities, our existing portfolio remains in a good position heading into the busier leasing season. Our broad diversification provides support during times of higher supply with a number of our mid-tier markets currently outperforming.
 As Tim will outline further, despite the high level of new supply, we continue to see solid demand and absorption, leading to improved current occupancy with future exposure better than this time last year.
 Our collections are strong and near pre-COVID levels at 99.6% of billed rents. Our resident base is stable with more residents choosing to live with us longer, supported by our focus on customer service, coupled with high single-family housing costs.
 Before I turn the call over to Tim to all of our associates at the properties in our corporate and regional offices. I want to say thank you for all you do to improve our business and serve our residents and those around you while exceeding expectations of those that depend on us.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim. 
Tim Argo: Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As Eric mentioned, new lease pricing in the first quarter continued to be impacted by elevated new supply deliveries in several of our markets. This, combined with typically slower traffic patterns that are evident this time of the year attributed to new lease pricing on a lease-over-lease basis of negative 6.2%.
 Renewal rates for the quarter stayed strong, growing 5%. Because traffic tends to be relatively low as compared to the second and third quarters, we intentionally repriced less than 20% of our leases in the first quarter. The new lease to renewal pricing resulted in blended lease-over-lease pricing of negative 0.6% for the quarter, an improvement of 100 basis points from the fourth quarter.
 Average physical occupancy was 95.3%, and collections outperformed expectations with net delinquency representing less than 0.4% of build rents. All these factors drove the resulting revenue growth of 1.4%. From a market perspective, in the first quarter, larger markets such as the Washington, D.C. metro area and Houston continue to hold up well and Nashville showed improvement.
 Many of our mid-tier metros also continue to be steady with Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville, all outperforming the broader portfolio from a blended lease-over-lease pricing standpoint.
 Our diversification between larger and mid-tier markets helps balance performance through the cycle. The improving performance of a market like Nashville, which is getting a lot of new supply, demonstrates the benefit of submarket diversification along with the market diversification. Austin and Jacksonville are two markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the absolute level of supply being delivered into those markets.
 Touching on some other highlights during the quarter. We continued our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives. For the first quarter of 2024, we completed nearly 1,100 interior unit upgrades. Given the number of units and lease up across our portfolio currently, we expect to renovate fewer units in 2024 than we would in a typical year, but would expect to reaccelerate the program in 2025.
 We have now completed over 94,000 smart home upgrades since the inception of the program, and we expect to complete the remaining few properties this year. For our repositioning program, we have 4 active projects that are in the repricing phase, and we have targeted an additional 6 projects to begin later in 2024 with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025.
 Regarding April metrics, we are encouraged by the accelerating trends from both the first quarter and March in both pricing and occupancy. April blended pricing is negative 0.4%, a 20 basis point improvement from the first quarter and a 70 basis point improvement from March. This is comprised of new lease pricing of negative 6.1%, a 10 basis point improvement from the first quarter and notably a 70 basis point improvement from March. And renewal pricing of 5.1%, slightly ahead of the first quarter and an improvement of 50 basis points from March.
 Average physical occupancy for April was 95.5%, also up from both the first quarter and March. And as Brad noted, 60-day exposure also remained lower than this time last year at 8.5% versus the prior year of 8.8%. As we've discussed, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets, but we still believe the outlook is similar to what we discussed last quarter.
 While we do expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, with demand and leasing traffic expected to increase in the spring and summer, we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease pricing and that the outlook is better for late 2024 and into 2025. It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in early to mid-2022. And we've seen historically that the maximum pressure on leasing is typically about 2 years after construction store.
 While supply remains elevated, the strength of demand is evident as well. Absorption in the first quarter in our markets was the highest for any first quarter in the last 2 decades and the highest of any quarter since the third quarter of 2021. Job growth is still expected to moderate some in 2024 as compared to 2023, but has recently been revised upwards and growth still expected to be strongest in the Sun Belt region in the country.
 Job growth combined with continued in-migration accelerate the key demand factor of household formation. Additionally, we saw a resident turnover continued to decline in the first quarter, and we expect it to remain low with fewer residents moving out to buy a home. In fact, the 12.9% of move-outs in the first quarter that were due to a resident buying a home with the lowest ever for MAA.
 That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn the call over to Clay. 
Clay Holder: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.22 per share, which was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our first quarter guidance. About half of the favorability was related to the timing of real estate taxes, while the remaining outperformance is related to the collective timing of overhead cost, interest expense and nonoperating income.
 Our same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter, driven by strong rent collections. Excluding the favorable timing of real estate tax expenses, same-store operating expenses were slightly higher than our first quarter guidance, primarily due to onetime property costs.
 During the quarter, we funded approximately $44 million of development cost of the current expected $647 million pipeline, leaving nearly $202 million to be funded on this pipeline over the next 2 years. Although we expect to complete three projects in the second half of 2024 with the additional starts that Brad mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to grow our development pipeline over the remainder of the year, which our balance sheet is well positioned to support.
 During the quarter, we invested a total of $9.4 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart rent installation programs, which we expect to produce solid returns and continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio.
 Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We ended the quarter with nearly $1.1 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund future investments.
 Our leverage remains low with net debt-to-EBITDA at 3.6x. And at quarter end, our outstanding debt was approximately 95% fixed with an average maturity of 7.2 years at an effective rate of 3.6%. During January, we issued $350 million of 10-year public bonds at an effective rate of 5.1%, using the proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper.
 We have an upcoming $400 million maturity in June that has an effective rate of 4%. Following this maturity, the next scheduled bond maturity is in the fourth quarter of 2025. Finally, with the bulk of leasing season ahead of us, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our core FFO guidance for the year while slightly tightening the full year range to $8.70 to $9.06 per share. We are also maintaining our same store as well as other key guidance ranges for the year.
 That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Regina, we will now turn the call back to you for questions. 
Operator: We will now open the call up for questions.
 [Operator Instructions]
 Our first question will come from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Just want to hit a little bit on the operating side of the business. And I was hoping you could provide some detail on sort of the operating playbook in the next couple of months and how you're thinking about pushing on lease rate growth and occupancy. And has the breakdown between new and renewal lease rate growth that you embedded in guidance changed at all at this point? 
Tim Argo: Austin this is Tim. Yes, I'll give you a little bit of an overview. I mean I think we're -- as I mentioned in my comments, with where we are in exposure, where we are with occupancy we feel like we're in a good place there. So we'll continue as we get into that, certainly, busier part of the season now, the push on new lease rent growth where we can and balance a little bit depending on property by property.
 It's not necessarily a portfolio-wide decision. We look at everything based on occupancy and exposure by property, but we're comfortable with where occupancy is. We'll continue to push on pricing where we can. As far as the mix between new lease renewal, first quarter was about where we expected it to be with renewals, probably 51% to 49% in terms of the total leases that we did in Q1. I would expect it to blend a little more towards renewals over the next couple of quarters.
 So that's a key thing to keep in mind as you think about pricing trajectory for the rest of the year is that we do expect turnover to remain low, and that the renewals have a little bit heavier weight than the new leases. 
Austin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. And then the March data implies there was a pocket of softness, which I think you alluded to a little bit in your prepared remarks, comparing the March versus April. I mean anything from a comp issue or a 60-day exposure perspective that caused you to pull back in March to just position the portfolio better heading into April and May? Just looking for some additional detail there. 
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean there was a little bit more of a push towards occupancy, I would say, in late February and early March is based again looking at it on a targeted basis where exposure was. And that's late February or early March time frame is always the time of the year where you start to see lease expirations pick up and you're kind of waiting on that demand to pick up as it as it has and it starts to do in March.
 So there was a little bit of a lean towards occupancy during that period. And as you saw, as we got into April, we saw acceleration both in pricing and in occupancy from where we're in March. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. 
Brad Heffern: Just sticking with the leasing spreads. Typically, you see a decent sized uptick in April. Obviously, I know March was weak and so there was an uptick, but it seems like it's not tremendously different than what you saw in January and February. So I guess has traffic picked up a lot in April? And are you surprised that the leasing spreads didn't increase more sequentially? 
Tim Argo: To the first question, yes, we have seen traffic pick up leads, lead volume, and we look at it kind of going back to the exposure factor. We look at leads for exposed unit, and that's as good as what it was. We've kind of talked about we haven't seen a normal year since probably 2018, 2019. So we're sort of exceeding those levels when you think about traffic volume and leads for exposed and all the things that we look at internally for demand.
 I mean, with the March new lease pricing, I mean, it's -- when you get into individual months, it can be volatility, and there's not a ton of leases getting done in the first quarter. So it's going to ebb and flow from month-to-month. What we're looking to see is kind of quarter-to-quarter, see that general trajectory moving up, and we're seeing that and it will play out over the next 3 or 4 months.
 I mean we will reprice about 50% of our leases for the year between May, June, July and August. Obviously, that will be  the biggest part of the impact of what it has on the year, and that's also when we start to see the traffic really pick up. So that's where it will really play out as over these next 3 or 4 months. 
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then in the prepared remarks, you said a stronger leasing environment through at least 2028 when the supply drops off, I think a lot of people would agree on 2026. But I'm curious why you would project strength that far out is the expectation that a low level of starts is just maintained indefinitely and that's what's driving it? Or if you could give your thinking there? 
Brad Hill: Brad, this is Brad. Yes, I think relative to that comment, it's a realization that the high level of supply that we are seeing today is partly a result of cheap financing that's been available over the last couple of years and just realizing that in general, those times are behind us. And so getting back to a more normal supply environment going forward into the future.
 I do think over the next couple of years, the supply environment will be below long-term averages, but perhaps we get back closer to long-term averages as we get out a few years. But then when you layer on top of that, just the demand strength that we are seeing in our region of the country leads us to believe that the fundamentals could be very, very good for a number of years. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. 
Stephen Chen: This is Stephen Chen on for Josh. Just a quick question on the concession usage. Wondering whether you can kind of comment on that, like across your markets. Where you see the biggest concession and where you see maybe the improvements? 
Tim Argo: Yes. This is Tim. I mean at a high level, concession usage is pretty similar to what we saw in Q4. We haven't seen it get materially worse or better. For us as a portfolio was about 0.5% of rents last quarter. It's about 0.4% of rents this quarter. At a market level, it obviously varies a little bit. I would say, again, not a lot of movement from last quarter.
 One market where we've seen it probably get a little bit heavier concession usage is in Charlotte, where we're seeing 1.5 to 2 months there. Austin continues to be, obviously, a heavy concession market, but no worse than really than what we were seeing before, where you've got 1 to 5 months and most of the submarkets in Austin with probably closer to 2, if you think about Central Austin.
 And then the other one we're keeping an eye on, I would say, is Atlanta, we're certainly in the Midtown area, we've seen concession uses pick up a little bit. But broadly, as I said, kind of stable and not seeing quite the usage from developers that we saw late last year. 
Stephen Chen: And then on a different subject on the development yield, sorry if I missed that, but can you comment on like what's the yield you're underwriting for the new starts? And maybe also some comments on the construction costs you're seeing right now? 
Brad Hill: This is Brad. Yes, I would comment that the yields that we're expecting on our new starts for this year are in the mid-6% range, which is consistent with what we're delivering today on our existing development portfolio. So that is a pretty good spread from where current cap rates are, call it, low 5s as I mentioned in my comments. So we're still in that call it, 150 basis points spread or so range with current cap rates, which feels really good to us.
 And in terms of construction costs, I mentioned in my comments, we haven't seen a broad reduction in construction costs. It's really market specific. There are some markets where the supply pipeline is really dropped faster and quicker and earlier than other markets, we're seeing some cost reduction in those markets.
 There are others, for example, the two projects that we are starting, we have seen our partners have been able to get construction cost reductions without scope reductions in those projects, which I think is a positive for both of those, but we're not seeing across the board construction cost reduction in our markets in general. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. 
Michael Goldsmith: It seems like the quarter was generally in line with expectations just above the midpoint, yet demand was unseasonably strong. So does that mean that demand needs to stay at unseasonably strong levels to kind of hit the high point of the guidance going forward? 
Tim Argo: I mean I don't think it needs to necessarily stay at higher levels than what we expected. I think it needs to be at levels that we've seen pretty consistently now for a while. I mean the demand has been there in our markets for a while. Job growth in migration continues. The number of move-outs that we're seeing outside of our -- to outside of our footprint has declined. So that net in migration is pretty consistent with where it's been.
 So it's really just continuing to see the demand at a steady level. And then now as we get into a heavier traffic period, we would expect that to obviously benefit, which is what you didn't see in Q4, Q1 is obviously the lower traffic patterns. But demand is there, and now we're getting into the heavier traffic season and heavier lease expirations, which will have a greater benefit.
 So I think mainly just seeing that demand at a high level, it would take some sort of economic shock, I think, to move it to where it's something that is not attainable in terms of thinking about our guidance. 
Michael Goldsmith: And my follow-up is, what is your expectations of leasing spreads during the peak leasing season? And how much momentum can be picked up on the new lease side? And along with that, can you hold renewals at 5% when new leases are down 6%? Does that lead to increased negotiation on renewals? 
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean we're -- this time of the year, there's always a fairly wide spread when you're looking at new leases first renewals. It's gapped out a little bit from where it typically is, but not hugely different, and I expect those spreads to narrow a little bit as we get into the spring and summer.
 Our expectation for renewals, and I think we've talked about a little bit last quarter, it's kind of in that 4.5% to 5% range. We've been closer to 5% right now. We think somewhere in that 4.5%, 4.75% range is reasonable for the rest of the year. And keeping in mind, too, when you think about the lower turnover, those renewals are going to have an outsized impact on the blended leasing spreads more so the new lease pricing.
 And our expectation for new lease pricing, while it is for it to accelerate from here over the next few months and then moderate back down as we get into Q4, still, but it's going to be negative for the full year. We don't expect to see new lease pricing get to 0 or get positive. I think it's probably well into the spring season, spring and summer 2025 before we see that. But that's a high level how we're thinking about it. 
H. Bolton: And Michael, this is Eric. Just to add on to what Tim is saying. I think another thing to keep in mind is when you look at that negative 6% on new lease pricing versus 5% of renewal in terms of a lease-over-lease comparison, that implies, I think, in some people's mind a bigger dollar difference than what's at play really. 
 If you look at the actual rent amount that we're achieving on new leases and the actual rent amount that we're achieving on renewals is only -- the spread is only about $150, and that, of course, as Tim mentioned, is kind of the biggest spread we see from a seasonal perspective. And then it tends to narrow a bit over the course of the spring and the summer.
 So the friction cost of moving and some of the other issues you run into moving suggest to us that spread is -- and again, recognizing it's going -- we think, narrow a bit over the spring and summer. We think yields an opportunity for us to continue to achieve the renewal pricing performance along the lines of what we've outlined, and we don't see any particular concerns about the spread in terms of what you're referring to. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citigroup. 
Eric Wolfe: Maybe just a follow-up on Michael's question there a second ago. Based on your guidance, it looks like you need around 1.7%, 1.8% sort of blended growth that to hit your blended spread guidance for the year. I mean, is that the right way to think about it? And I guess when do you think we'll hit that level? 
Tim Argo: When you say, are you talking about blended spreads or new lease, you talking about blended? 
Eric Wolfe: Blended spread. I mean blended spread, I mean, I think your guidance before is 1%. So if you're based on what you've done thus far, we were calculating like 1.7%, 1.8% for the rest of the year? And then I guess, on the new lease side, right, if you assume 5% renewal for the rest of the year, you probably need like negative 2% on new lease. But I was just trying to understand sort of what's embedded for the rest of the year and when you think we'll see those levels. 
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean I don't think it's quite to the level you said on new leases. I mean, a couple of things to keep in mind that we sort of alluded to is one, the Q2 and Q3 will represent about 60%, 65% of all the leases. So -- which is also the strongest period. So that will weigh heavier into the full year blended. And then along with that, we tend to see the renewal portion of that mix tick up even more in Q2 and Q3 as well.
 So you have to -- when you're thinking about a dialed in a heavier weighting on the renewals and dialed in a heavier weighting on the lease spread throughout the year. So yes, I mean, I think we talked about kind of 4.5% to 5% in the renewal range and new leases staying negative, but certainly accelerating from where they are now.
 And then as you get into kind of September and beyond, would expect it to drop back down, not quite to the level we saw in Q4 of last year, but certainly a little bit further negative. But I think the main thing to keep in mind is just the weighting both in terms of leases per quarter and then the weighting between new leases renewals. 
Eric Wolfe: Got it. That's helpful. And then there was a comment in the release and you alluded to it in your remarks about a quick turnaround in rental performance later this year, next year. Sort of what markets do you think we'll see that turnaround the fastest. So based on your supply projections, where do you think we'll see that quicker turnaround? 
Tim Argo: Yes. I would say that at a high level, the markets that have been strong, continue to be strong, and I would expect to remain strong. And then I'm thinking about D.C. and Houston and then some of the mid-tier markets like Charleston and Richmond and Savannah and Greenville to some extent.
 The ones I would keep an eye on that I think can start really helping some of the Florida markets, both Orlando and Tampa are starting to show some improvement, and we're, I think, a little bit further along in that supply absorption, if you will, than some other markets.
 So those are a couple. And then I remarked about Nashville in the prepared comments as well. That's another one that I think continue to see some benefit from. It's getting a lot of supply and working through it, but where we are in that market is pretty well positioned. So I would say those three beyond the ones that have been pretty steady for us right now. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. 
Daniel Tricarico: It's Daniel Tricarico for Nick. Maybe for Brad, can you expand on the confidence in the acquisition opportunity that you highlighted in your prepared remarks? And also, what is the initial and stabilized yield on the Raleigh lease-up deal? 
Brad Hill: Yes. So the Raleigh lease-up deal is a 6% NOI yield is what we're expecting out of that. And I'm sorry, I missed the very first part of your question. 
Daniel Tricarico: Just a general commentary you had in the prepared remarks on the confidence in the acquisition opportunity set. 
Brad Hill: Yes. I mean I think if you look at where we sit today, as we've said over the last few quarters, the transaction market has been quiet for a couple of years, but the supply is up. So we just feel like the need to transact continues to build while we're not seeing transactions I think the difficulty has been the volatility on interest rates has really slowed the market down from transactions occurring.
 But I'll tell you, just looking at our underwriting deals that we've reviewed, the volume is up. There's more coming out. There's more in the market right now. I think we -- first quarter, what we underwrote was double what it was in fourth quarter. It's still not to where it was a couple of years ago. So we do believe that, that volume just continues to grow from where we sit today. And I would say the other thing that gives us confidence really is just our history in the Sun Belt.
 Eric mentioned we've been focused exclusively on this region for 30 years, and we have a reputation of performance in our region of the country, whether it's on the operating side or transaction side. So we get a lot of looks and opportunities that perhaps others do not get. The Raleigh opportunity specifically was an off-market opportunity that we got, and I think we'll have other opportunities like that.
 Our relationships are pretty strong and deep in this region of the country, especially with the merchant developers who are the largest builders in this region. If you look at what we purchased over the last 10 years, almost $2 billion, over 80% of that was from merchant developers. So we have a very good relationship with all of those folks. And we think that will lead to additional opportunities as we go through the year. 
Daniel Tricarico: And then just going back to the revenue outlook, the job growth numbers you talked about an initial guidance obviously seem pretty conservative now 4 months into the year, but no change to the revenue components in guidance. How should we be interpreting that? 
Tim Argo: I think really just interpreting to the fact that we have the heavier leasing season ahead of us. Like I said, the first quarter leasing is about 19% of our leases. So we'll do 50% over the next 4 months. That's really when driving -- it's just seeing how it plays out over the next few months, but certainly encourage where the demand side is. 
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. 
Haendel St. Juste: So I'm encouraged to hear that your development pipeline is leasing up better than expected and concessions are stabilizing. But my question is, one, I guess, more so on the private market. Are you tracking how the private market to supply is getting leased up their absorption? I'm thinking back to last summer when the private guys blink and they dropped pricing late in the summer to achieve some target goals and end up obviously impacting demand and pricing on your end.
 So I guess I'm curious if you're seeing anything on the data or behavior that can give you any insight into how their progress is coming along or if we could be facing the same risk later this summer? 
Brad Hill: This is Brad, and I'll start, Tim can add to it. We do have a little bit of insight in that just via a couple of avenues. One, the comp properties all of our properties. We monitor specifically how our comps are performing. And then also, as I mentioned earlier, we just have relationships with all the developers in the market.
 And I would say just in general, from the information that we have, we're seeing a more measured approach to concession usage this time this year than we did in the third, fourth quarter of last year. And we're not seeing as much pressure from the developers at this point in terms of pushing to get ahead of the supply wave. We're in the supply wave now.
 So now they're starting to look at potentially monetizing and transacting their properties and leaning too heavily into concessions at this point is going to severely impact their valuation. So they're being a bit more measured at this time of the year than they were last year from what we can see at this point. 
Tim Argo: Yes. And I'll add to that. I mean, we do track properties in our markets that are in lease-up and how quickly they're leasing up and that sort of thing. And right now that would suggest any concerns from that point. I mean, certainly, as we get later in this year and you get to the fourth quarter, things can change quickly based on what they're doing, but we're not seeing it right now, but that is part of why we certainly dial in, particularly on the new lease side that we think it will moderate back down as you get into the fourth quarter.
 And even though we think supply will be less than it is today, it probably doesn't manifest itself in terms of seeing that in the numbers probably until you get into 2025. 
Haendel St. Juste: And can you remind us, you mentioned the number of good markets that are hitting peak supply this quarter. Which markets are still left to hit peak supply amongst your larger markets? 
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean it's pretty consistent, to be honest, where again, we kind of look back to when construction starts and do a lot of looks at different markets of how long it takes to that peak pressure to hit. But -- and most of them are in sort of that Q2 time frame. I would say Atlanta is probably one, that's maybe a little bit behind that curve. Charlotte is one that's probably a little bit behind that curve. And then I would think of a market like Phoenix and we're landing in Tampa probably a little bit ahead of that curve. But at a high level, most are within that range and certainly within a quarter, give or take, of that same range. 
Haendel St. Juste: My second question is just -- I'm sorry if you provided this, but what's the indicative pricing today for your June debt maturity? Curious what kind of rates you're seeing in the market right now, what we should assume? 
Clay Holder: Haendel, this is Clay. Right now, we're seeing anywhere between 5.6% and 5.7% as we look to that maturity. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. 
Adam Kramer: Just wondering where you've gone out for May, June and maybe even July at this point for your renewals? 
Tim Argo: Yes, for the next couple of months, and we're just wrapping up July now, but for the next couple of months, we're in the 4.6%, 4.7%, 4.8% range. 
Adam Kramer: Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the development starts, Look, I really appreciate the disclosure and color on kind of the couple of starts that you had in the last quarter and beginning of second quarter. And look, I think given where your balance sheet is and given I think what you've described as a really compelling opportunity to deliver into much less supply in '26, '27, '28, what would prevent you or what would encourage you kind of drive you to do more developments today, again, given where the balance sheet is, I would think you have the capacity to start a bunch more?
 So maybe just walk us kind of the puts and the takes? And maybe just at a higher conceptual level, the thought process around whether to do more development, start more now to deliver into that kind of undersupply period in '26, '27 and '28. 
Brad Hill: Adam, this is Brad. Certainly, we have been building development as a capability and a tool for us to lean into over the last couple of years. And as I mentioned in my comments, we have a pipeline of projects that we could start and really deliver value over the next couple of years. Really what's preventing us from doing that more broadly, has just been hitting the returns that we need on our developments.
 As I mentioned, the two that we're starting in the second quarter we're able to get some construction cost reductions out of those to get the yields to where we think, call it that 100 to 150 basis point spread to cap rates puts us in that 6% to 6.5% range. And the two that we're starting are in that 6.5% range.
 So we feel really good about those developments where they're located. The markets, the ability to layer our platform onto those when they deliver and drive additional efficiencies long term. But we expect, as I mentioned, we've started -- we'll start two here in the second quarter, another one to two by the end of this year. And then we have another three that we have approvals in place and ready to go, if we're able to get construction costs down far enough to make the numbers work at those hurdles that I mentioned.
 But aside from those, again, we are continuing to evaluate the land market. We're continuing to evaluate our prepurchase opportunities. There could be opportunities that emerge in that area where a merchant developer that we have a relationship with perhaps has an equity partner that backs out or can't raise debt or something along those lines that provides us another opportunity to lean into that area.
 So development is an area that we continue to focus on and believe strongly in terms of creating long-term value through that avenue. So to the extent that we continue to get the returns that make sense, we'll continue to execute in that area. 
H. Bolton: Adam, this is Eric. Just to add on to what Brad is saying. We spend a lot of time thinking about just how much development risk that we want to put on the platform. And one of the things that we centered around is the idea that we'd like to keep our exposure in forward funding obligations, if you will, no more than around sort of 5% of enterprise values, which based on sort of where pricing is today for us, that would put it at around $1 billion.
 Also recognizing that we've got a lot more of our development increasingly has been through this repurchase program where we are effectively partnering with merchant developers that we know quite well throughout the region, and it enables us to share in some of the risk and some of the downside issues that you could sometimes run into with development.
 So taking our pipeline up a bit from where it is today, not something we would hesitate to do given both the approach that we're taking and just the capacity we have on the balance sheet and in terms of overall enterprise value. So we feel pretty good about pushing on this agenda as much as the numbers will support in terms of what Brad was discussing. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. 
John Kim: I believe Adrian mentioned in his prepared remarks that acquisition cap rates have compressed to 5.1% despite the raise in interest rates. So I guess my question is, is it your view that the appetite for negative leverage has come back? Or were these transactions one-off with below market debt? 
Brad Hill: John, this is Brad. I don't think that these cap rates are representative of below-market debt. I mean I don't think there's many loan assumptions that are in these numbers that I'm quoting. And some of these are reflective of very recent transactions as of a few days ago, where we've gotten the cap rate information.
 So these are very current numbers in terms of yields. I mean, honestly, the spread of cap rates is wider than what it has been in the past. I mean the spread that we're seeing right now is from 4.5% to, call it, 5.5% and really, again, averaging in that low 5% range.
 So in terms of where debt is today, it's in the -- debt rates are in the high 5% range, almost 6%. So my assumption would be that these underwritings either are assuming a run-up in fundamentals or refinance in a couple of years where they're able to take the interest rate back down. 
John Kim: And are you willing to transact at these levels because this is the market now? 
Brad Hill: Well, we're not. If you look at the Raleigh acquisition, for example, that's representative and the two acquisitions that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. That's representative of where we're willing to transact, which from a yield perspective, has been in the high 5s and then the Raleigh transaction was a 6% yield.
 That's where we are comfortable transacting. And we believe, again, based on our ability our balance sheet strength, ability to close all cash and things of that nature, focusing on properties that are in lease-up that are hard to finance that selectively, we'll be able to find some opportunities to help us hit our $400 million forecast. But at a broad market level of a 5% or so cap rate, at this point, we're not active in that in that price range. 
John Kim: Okay. My second question, if I could squeeze one in, is on your turnover at a record low level, which is surprising given market dynamics I realize a lot of residents are not moving out to buy a home. But is there anything else about the residents today that are different than maybe a few years ago, whether it's the less mobile now or the cost of moving has gone up just more reluctant to move or maybe they're more aware of the concession came and land was used?. 
Tim Argo: This is Tim, John. I don't think there's anything especially different in the resident. We look at all the sort of the resident demographics are pretty consistent with what they've been the last couple of years. But certainly, it's much more difficult to buy a house. And if you look at our markets in particular, given where interest rates are now, it's about 70% more expensive household than it is our average rent.
 So that's a very significant difference and then you consider cost moving and all that. And so that plays into it. And the other reason that's down is certainly move out to a rent increase or down pretty significantly than what we've seen in the last couple of years as well.
 So I think those two things are driving it and primarily just the cost of buying, which is -- that's always historically along with job transfer by houses that are our highest reason for move out. So I think that's driving it down, combined with the move-out increase. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. 
James Feldman: I guess just shifting gear to the expense side. Can you talk more about the kind of outsized expenses in the first quarter? And just as you're thinking about your guidance for the rest of the year, has anything changed? Are there any areas where you're more or less confident on being able to hit the decline item in your numbers or just things you may want to point out that we should be paying attention to? 
Clay Holder: Sure, Jamie. This is Clay. Just speaking to the first quarter and what we saw there. The biggest -- the slight unfavorable we had there that we called out in the comments, was really around some onetime property costs around some storm damages that we had at a number of properties, nothing significant, but it was a bit of -- a bit outside of what we were dialing in for the quarter.
 As we think about going forward through the rest of the year, I mean, we're still early on. And when you look to what our larger expense line items are specifically real estate expenses, we still need some more information there before we can really peg that number, but we still feel very confident about our guidance that we set forth on real estate tax expenses at about 4.75% growth year-over-year.
 Also, insurance expenses will, although a much smaller component of our operating expense stack, still some more information to come on it as well. When you think about personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs and the other line items that are touching there, we feel confident about those, and those trended in line with what we were expecting for first quarter, and we expect those to continue in that same manner over the remainder of the year. 
James Feldman: Okay. I mean, so it sounds like you kind of baked in some risk there on all of those, if you're not quite sure what the outcome looks like, but you're pretty comfortable... 
Tim Argo: I'd say that's fair. I mean, again, real estate taxes will get the majority of the valuation around that. In late second quarter, early third quarter, we'll probably have a little bit more to say about that in the second quarter call. Same for insurance expense as well. And again, the other expenses pretty much in line with what we've dialed in. 
James Feldman: Okay. Great. And then I guess just thinking about where we are in the cycle and the opportunities you're seeing if you think about where you may be buying, I mean, you've got your more supply-challenged markets or some of the larger MSAs then your footprint, you've also got access -- you've also got exposure in markets like Kansas City, Birmingham, Fredericksburg. Do you think the opportunities this cycle are going to show up in those types of markets more? And when we look back in 5 years and think about the portfolio footprint, maybe that's where you guys grow more? Or no, you want to stick with the larger population, faster job growth market as you build out the portfolio and put your capital to work? 
Brad Hill: Jamie, this is Brad. I think as we look at where we want to deploy capital, broadly speaking, the high-growth regions of where we're located is what we're targeting. And that's going to be both our larger markets as well as some of our mid-tier markets that you mentioned. I mean in Tim's prepared comments, he noted some of the mid-tier markets that are performing quite well right now.
 Our larger markets. We are committed to those. I think when we combine both of those components as part of our story, it's part of the diversification that we're looking for, for our earnings stream, and I think they perform well together.
 So I would say you would see us focus on both components there in terms of growing. I would also just say that as we focus on buying new properties generally that are in lease-up, where the average age over the last 10 years that we purchased has been 1 year.
 So these are brand-new properties generally, those are going to follow a little bit of where the supply is. That's where the opportunities are going to be that we're going to find. But broadly speaking, both segments of our portfolio will be areas that we focus on. 
James Feldman: Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up on that. Like when you're underwriting acquisitions, what is your rent growth outlook? What are you guys modeling in '24, '25, '26, the time for the deal? 
Brad Hill: Yes, it's going to be different based on each market. But I would say, in general, '24 is going to be flattish. But you also have to remember that on our deals that we're underwriting on an acquisition, the leases are predominantly new leases, which is different than our existing portfolio, but we're generally bringing all new leases into the portfolio.
 So it's going to be flattish year 1, 2025 is going to have a positive uptick and '26 and '27 are going to be higher than long-term averages on average. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldvarg with Piper Sandler. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Two questions. The first is jobs have definitely been stronger than everyone collectively as imagined. And my question is, were you guys just overly conservative in job expectations? Or have the jobs truly been like much better than anyone would have expected? Just trying to understand the difference, what's going on because clearly, it's allowing you guys and others to handle the supply much better than was originally believed to be the case. 
H. Bolton: Well, we use a number of different sources to compile our view of what the demand horizon and the job growth is going to be. Obviously, a year or so ago, there was more nervousness surrounding the prospects of a more material slowdown in the economy. We have seen some moderation in '24 as compared to certainly '23 and '22, but broadly speaking, we've long believed that these Sun Belt markets had underpinnings associated with them surrounding employer stability and job growth and new jobs coming such that we felt pretty good about the job growth or about the employment markets broadly holding up.
 What has probably been, frankly, more surprising for us is just what's happening in terms of our resident behavior who slightly move-outs to buying a home. The real decline in people leaving to go buy a home and resulting impact that has on demand has probably been the more surprising factor in our thinking about demand projections.
 We weren't really that surprised by the employment market and the migration trends have continued to hold up very similar to what we've experienced for the last few years. So I would say the home buying scenario has probably been the biggest surprise variable for us. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is transaction market really tough. But in fairness, it's -- I mean, the transaction market almost, I guess, you'd have to go back to the RTC days for it to be sort of lucrative. And over the past decade or so since the credit crisis, we've never seen assets dumped onto the market.
 So was there a thinking that -- what is your sense? Is it the bank regulators are just getting a lot more lenient with the banks? On the banks for them dealing with developers and saying, look, if the guy is sort of doing a good effort, don't force a foreclosure, don't force a sale or what do you think has changed? Because it sounds like it's more on the lending side that the owners or developers aren't being pushed to transact in assets that maybe 15, 20 years ago, they would have been.
 So would you attribute that more to the regulators or to something else out there that's not forcing the deals that you would have otherwise expected to happen? 
Brad Hill: Yes. This is Brad. I think there's really two components of that. I would say, number one, we have seen a number of loans, specifically in 2023. The last number I saw was 85% of the loans that were coming due, we're pushed. We're extended in 2023.
 So I do think there is a component of that, that has occurred. I think relative to developers, specifically, I think for them, over the last couple of years, there's been a change in how they have approached their construction lending, in the term that they're able to get in their construction loans now is longer than what I have ever seen it before, where they're able to get 4 to 5 years in their term of their construction loans.
 And a lot of times, they have the ability built in if they're hitting certain coverage ratios, they're able to extend that 6 months, 1 year, 2 years. there are certain components built into those loans that I think are allowing developers to be a little bit more runway before they're forced to sell on new construction loans. So I think those two components are really addressing that. 
H. Bolton: And Alex, this is Eric. I'll add on to what Brad is saying. A couple of other things that I think I would point to as well, when you try to contrast and compare the buying environment, the buying opportunity that we thought was going to be forthcoming, contrast that to historical cycles in the past, like coming out of the great financial recession in 2008, 2009, that 2-year period following that fall off. We bought 9,000 apartments in 2 years.
 But a lot of that was a function of, if you will, a real recession, real demand fell off considerably. And anytime you have an environment where the demand is really negatively impacted that can really create some distress. And we just haven't seen that play out this time. Demand has remained very strong.
 And I think that has confidence among a lot of merchant builders and banks to have the ability to sort of hang in there because the demand has been so strong. And then secondly, the thing that's at play here as compared to past cycles where buying opportunities were more plentiful is that there is so much capital on the sidelines now ready to pounce and people know that.
 And so I think just the backdrop of strong demand a lot of investor capital ready to jump into multifamily, particularly in the Sun Belt has enabled the markets in pricing to hold up better than what I think some people thought was likely to happen. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. 
Linda Yu Tsai: Just wondering if you're doing anything differently on the marketing side to drive traffic in the higher supply markets? 
Tim Argo: This is Tim. I mean, probably not necessarily anything differently on a market-by-market basis, but we've actually updated our website back toward the end of February, which is intended to drive more traffic organically and through to our site as opposed to using some IOSs, which can be quite a bit more expensive. We're getting more involved in some social media things and that type of thing. But it's really just trying to drive people and traffic towards our website and really be able to experience what's there and have a better feel for the community in the neighborhood, and we have everything you want to look at there with floor plans and unit types and all that sort of thing.
 So it's really just continuing to expand how we think about that and how we use technology there as well as getting a little more involved in some of the social media channels. 
Linda Yu Tsai: And then along those lines, any automation or efficiency initiatives? Any updates to highlight there? 
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean there's the one highlight that we talked about is something that we think will not only drive down marketing costs but increased demand and the traffic coming in that way. There's a smart home initiative that we've been talking about that we're wrapping up this year. I mean I think over the next 2, 3, 4 years, the biggest initiative in terms of what it can do for margin is continuing sort of our ubiquitous or full property WiFi.
 We have half of our property on a bulk Internet program now. We've been doing that for 3 or 4 years, but there's opportunities for the other half with this even enhanced version of higher margin. I think there's a $30 million more opportunity there. Just on the part of the portfolio that's not on bulk. And then I think as we renegotiate some of those existing contracts, there's huge opportunities there as we look over the next several years. 
Operator: We have no further questions. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks. 
H. Bolton: We appreciate everyone joining us this morning, and feel free to reach out for other questions and see most of you at NAREIT I'm sure. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Please go ahead. 
Andrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Carrie and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team participating on the call this morning with prepared comments are Eric Bolton, Brad Hill, Tim Argo and Clay Holder. Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, and Joe Fracchia are also participating and available for questions as well.  Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34x filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplements are currently available on the -- for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Andrew and good morning. Core FFO results for the fourth quarter were ahead of our expectations. Higher non-same-store NOI performance and lower interest expense drove the outperformance. As expected during the fourth quarter, a combination of higher new supply and a seasonal slowdown in leasing traffic increasingly weighed on new resident lease pricing during the quarter. Encouragingly, we did see some of this pressure moderate in January with blended pricing improving 130 basis points from the fourth quarter performance led by improvement in new lease pricing. Stable employment conditions, continued positive migration trends, a higher propensity of new households to rent apartments and continued low resident turnover are all combining to support steady demand for apartment housing.  We continue to believe that late this year, new lease pricing performance will improve and we will begin to capture recovery in that component of our revenue performance. In addition, with the pressure surrounding higher new supply deliveries likely to moderate later this year, we continue to believe the conditions are coming together for overall pricing recovery to begin late this year and into 2025. As you may have seen last week, MAA crossed a significant milestone marking the 30-year anniversary since our IPO. Over the past 30 years, MAA has delivered an annual compounded investment return to shareholders of 12.6%, with about half of that return comprised of the cash dividends paid. Through numerous new supply cycles and various stresses associated with the broader economy, MAA has never suspended or reduced our quarterly dividend over the past 30 years, which, of course, is a key component of delivering superior long-term as returns to REIT shareholders. Today, I'm more positive about our outlook than I was this time last year. Today, as compared to a year ago, we have more clarity about the outlook for interest rates with downward movement likely later in the year. More REITs associated with material economic slowdown or recession are dissipating. Inflation pressures on operating expenses are declining. The demand for apartment housing and absorption remained steady. And with clearly declining permits and new construction start, we have increasing visibility that competing new supply is poised to moderate. With a 30-year track record of focus on high growth markets, successfully working through several economic cycles, an experienced team and proven operating platform, a strong balance sheet and long-term shareholder performance among the top tier of all REITs, we're confident about our ability to execute on the growing opportunities in the coming year and beyond. Before turning the call over to Brad, I do want to take a moment to say a big thank you to Al Campbell, who will be officially retiring effective March 31st. Al has been with our team for the past 26 years and has served as our Chief Financial Officer for the past 14 years. Al has been instrumental in the growth of our company, transitioning us to the investment grade debt capital markets and has built a strong finance, accounting, tax internal audit platform for MAA. Al leads our company and finance operation in strong hands with Clay and his team. Overall, grateful for Al's service and tremendous accomplishments. So thank you, Al, for all you've done for MAA. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brad. 
Brad Hill: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As mentioned in our earnings release, we successfully closed on 2 compelling acquisitions during the fourth quarter at pricing 15% below current replacement costs. Both properties fit the profile of the type of properties we expect to continue to emerge throughout 2024. Properties in their initial lease up, with sellers focused on certainty of execution with the need to transact prior to a definitive deadline. Our relationships with the sellers and our ability to move quickly and execute on the transactions utilizing the available capacity on our line of credit without a financing contingency were key components of MAA being chosen as the buyer for these properties. MAA Central Avenue a 323-unit mid-rise property in the Midtown area of Phoenix and MAA Optimist Park a 352-unit mid-rise property in the Optimist Park area of Charlotte are expected to deliver initial stabilized NOI yields of 5.5% and 5.9%, respectively. We expect both properties to achieve further yield and margin expansion as a result of adopting MAA's more sophisticated revenue management, marketing and lead generation practices as well as our technology platform. Additionally, we expect to achieve operational synergies by combining certain functions with other area MAA properties as part of our new property potting initiative. Due to continued interest rate volatility and tight credit conditions, transaction volume remains tepid, down 50% year-over-year and 16% from the third quarter space. We continue to believe that transaction volumes will pick up later in 2024, providing visibility into cap rates and market values. For deals we tracked in the fourth quarter, we saw cap rates move up by roughly 35 basis points from third quarter.  Our transaction team is very active in evaluating additional acquisition opportunities across our footprint with our balance sheet in great position to be able to take advantage of more compelling opportunities as they continue to materialize later this year. Our forecast for the year includes $400 million of new acquisitions, likely in lease up and therefore, dilutive until stabilization is reached.  Despite pressure from elevated new supply, our two stabilized new developments as well as our development projects currently leasing continue to deliver good performance, producing higher NOIs and earnings than forecasted in our original pro-formas, creating additional long-term value. New lease rates are facing more pressure at the moment, but these properties have captured asking rents on average approximately 20% above our original expectations. Our four developments that are currently leasing are estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.5%. We continue to advance predevelopment work on several projects, but due to permitting and approval delays, as well as an expectation that construction costs are likely to come down. We have pushed the three projects that we plan to start in 2023 into 2024. We now expect to start between 3 to 4 projects this year, with 2 starts in the first half of the year and 2 starts late in the year. Encouragingly, we have seen some recent success in getting our construction costs down on new projects that we're currently repricing.  As we have seen a meaningful decline in construction starts in our region, we're hopeful to see continued decline in construction costs as we progress through the year. Our team has done a tremendous job building out our future development pipeline. And today, we own or control 13 well-located sites, representing a growth opportunity of nearly 3,700 units. We have optionality on when we start these projects, allowing us to remain patient and disciplined. Any project we start this year, we'll deliver first units in 2026, aligning with the likely stronger leasing environment supported by significantly lower supply. Our development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this constrained liquidity environment, it's possible we could add additional development opportunities to our future pipeline. The team has our portfolio in good position. Our broad diversification provides support during times of higher supply with a number of our mid-tier markets outperforming. As we ramp up activities in 2024, we're excited about the coming year. Beyond the new external growth opportunities just covered and as Tim will outline further, we continue to see solid demand and steady absorption of the new supply delivering across our markets and remain convinced that pricing trends will begin to improve late this year and into 2025. In addition, we continue to make progress on several new initiatives aimed at further enhancing our leasing platform to further position us to outperform local market leasing metrics during the supply cycle. Before I turn the call over to Tim to all of our associates at the properties and our corporate and regional offices. I want to say thank you for coming to work every day, focused on improving our business, serving our residents and exceeding the expectations of those that depend on us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.
Tim Argo : Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Same-store NOI growth for the quarter was right in line with our expectations with slightly lower operating expenses offsetting slightly lower blended lease over lease pricing growth. Expanding on Eric's earlier comment on new lease pricing, developers looking to gain occupancy ahead of the holiday season and the end of the year did put further pressure on new lease pricing, particularly in November and December.  However, because traffic tends to decline in the fourth quarter, again, particularly in November and December, we intentionally repriced only 16% of our leases in the fourth quarter and only about 9% in November and December. This resulted in blended lease-over-lease pricing of minus 1.6% for the quarter comprised of new lease rates declining 7% and renewal rates increasing 4.8%. Average physical occupancy was 95.5% and collections remained strong, with delinquency representing less than 0.5% of bill grants. These key components drove the resulting revenue growth of 2.1%.  From a market perspective in the fourth quarter many of our mid-tier metros performed well. Being invested in a broad number of markets, submarkets, asset types and price points is a key part of our strategy to capture growth throughout the cycle.  Savannah, Richmond, Charleston and Greenville are examples of markets that led the portfolio and lease-over-lease pricing performance. The Washington, D.C. metro area, Houston and to a lesser extent, Dallas/Fort Worth for larger metros that held up well. Austin and Jacksonville are 2 markets that continue to be more negatively impacted by the level of supply being delivered into those markets. Touching on some other highlights during the quarter. We continued our various product upgrade and redevelopment initiatives in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, we completed nearly 1,400 interior unit upgrades, bringing our full year total to just under 6,900 units. We completed over 21,000 smart home upgrades in 2023 and now have over 93,000 units with this technology and we expect to complete the remaining few properties in 2024. For our repositioning program, we have 5 active projects that are in the repricing phase with expected yields in the 8% range. We have targeted an additional 6 projects began in 2024, with a plan to complete construction and begin repricing in 2025. Now looking forward to 2024, we're encouraged by the relative pricing trends we are seeing thus far. As noted by Eric, blended pricing in January, it was 130 basis points better than the fourth quarter. This is comprised of new lease pricing of negative 6.2%, an 80 basis point improvement for the fourth quarter and notably a 150 basis point improvement from December and renewal pricing of 5.1%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter, while maintaining stable occupancy of 95.4%. Similarly, renewal increases achieved thus far in February and March average around 5%.  As noted, new supply being delivered continues to be a headwind in many of our markets. While we do expect this new supply will continue to pressure pricing for much of 2024, we believe we have likely already seen the maximum impact to new lease pricing and that the outlook is better for late 2024 and into 2025. It varies by market, but on average, new construction starts in our portfolio footprint peaked in the second quarter of 2022.  Based on typical delivery time lines, this suggests peak deliveries likely in the middle of this year with some positive impact of pricing power soon thereafter. While increasing supply is impactful, strength of demand is more indicative of the pricing power in a particular market. Job growth is expected to moderate some in 2024 as compared to 2023, but growth is still expected to be strongest in the Sunbelt markets. Job growth combined with continued in-migration accelerates the key demand factor of household formation. Separately, the cost gap between owning and renting gapped out considerably in the back half of 2023, even before considering the impact of higher mortgage rates. Move out to buy a home dropped 20% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, and we expect a continued low number of move-outs due to home buying to contribute to low turnover overall in 2024. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. Now I'll turn the call over to Clay.
Clay Holder: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.32 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance and contributed core FFO for the full year of $9.17 per share, representing an approximate 8% increase over the prior year. The outperformance for the quarter was primarily driven by favorable interest and the performance of our recent acquisitions and lease-up during the quarter.  Overall, same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly below our expectations for the quarter as effective rent growth was impacted by lower lease pricing that Tim mentioned. Same-store operating expenses were slightly favorable to our fourth quarter guidance primarily from lower-than-expected personnel costs and property taxes.  During the quarter, we invested a total of $20.7 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart brand installation programs, producing solid returns and adding to the quality of our portfolio. We also funded $48 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $647 million pipeline, leaving nearly $256 million remaining to be funded on this pipeline over the next 2 years.  As Brad mentioned, we also expect to start to 3 to 4 projects over the course of 2024, which would keep our development pipeline at a level consistent with where we ended 2023, in which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support. We ended the year with nearly $792 million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant opportunity to fund potential investment opportunities. Our leverage remains low with debt to EBITDA at 3.6x. And at year-end, our outstanding debt was approximately 90% fixed with an average of 6.8 years at an effective rate of 3.6%. Shortly after year-end, we issued $350 million of 10-year public bonds at an effective rate of 5.1%, using the proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper.  Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2024 with our release, which is detailed in the supplemental information package. Core FFO for the year is projected to be $8.68 to $9.08 or $8.88 at the midpoint. The projected 2024 same-store revenue growth midpoint of 0.9% results from rental pricing earned in of 0.5% combined with blended rental pricing expectation of 1% for the year. We expect blended rental pricing as to be comprised of lower new lease processing impacted by elevated supply levels and renewal pricing in line with historical levels. Effective rent growth for the year is projected to be approximately 0.9% at the midpoint of our range. We expect occupancy to average between 95.4% and 96% for the year and other revenue items, primarily reimbursement and fee income to grow in line with effective rent.  Same-store operating expenses are projected to grow at a midpoint of 4.85% for the year, with real estate taxes and insurance producing most of the growth pressure. Combined, these 2 items are expected to grow almost 6% for 2024 with the remaining controllable operating items expected to grow just over 4%. These expense projections combined with the revenue growth of 0.9% results in a projected decline in same-store NOI of 1.3% at the midpoint. We have a recently completed development community in lease-up, along with an additional 3 development communities actively leasing. As these 4 communities are not fully leased up and stabilized and given the interest carry associated with these projects, we anticipate our development pipeline being diluted to core FFO by about $0.05 in 2024 and turning accretive to core FFO on later stabilization. We are expecting continued external growth in 2024, both through acquisitions and development opportunities. We anticipate a range of $350 million to $450 million in acquisitions, all likely to be in lease-up and not yet stabilized and a range of $250 million to $350 million in development investments for the year. This growth will be partially funded by asset sales, which we expect dispositions of approximately $100 million, with the remainder to be funded by debt financing and internal cash flow. This external growth is expected to be slightly dilutive to core FFO in 2024 and then again, turning to accretive to core FFO after stabilizing. We project total overhead expenses, a combination of property management expenses and G&A expenses to be $132.5 million at the midpoint, a 4.9% increase over 2023 results. We expect to refinance $400 million of bonds maturing in June 2024. These bonds currently have a rate of 4% and we forecast to refinance north of 5%. This expected refinance, coupled with the recently completed refinancing activities mentioned previously, results of $0.04 of dilution to core FFO as compared to prior year. That is all that we have in the way of prepared comments.  So Carrie, we will now turn the call back to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.
Joshua Dennerlein : I appreciate all the color you provided on guidance. My first question would just be on the same-store revenue growth outlook. Can you provide us any more details on what would get you to the high and low end of guidance? And I guess, I'm really curious about what you would assume for the blended rate growth at the higher low end.
Tim Argo: This is Tim. So I think as far as the high end of the low end, I think we feel pretty comfortable with the renewal rates and they've been steady for the last few months. What we're seeing, as I noted, the next few months as being in that 5% range. I think that the new lease rates are what could certainly determine whether we get more to the high and low end, which is going to be a function of the demand side. We expect to see steady job growth, steady demand and migration, all those factors. So that's a little bit better. I think it obviously pushes new lease rates higher and then the opposite is true. But if you think about our full year guide, it's built on new lease rates for the year, and this will be seasonal, starting a little bit lower in Q1, accelerating to Q2 and Q3 and then declining a little late Q4, but somewhere in the negative 3%, 3.25% range on new lease for the year and expectations of the 4.5% to 5% range on renewals, which blends out to the 1% blended is what we're assuming for the full year.
Joshua Dennerlein : I appreciate that. And then there's a drag that you're assuming on the $400 million of acquisitions, is there a way to quantify that?
Clay Holder: Yes, I think you can think -- Josh, you think through what we're projecting new rates to come in in this next year, and kind of the timing of those acquisitions from the standpoint of just the timing of it, we're assuming that those start in second quarter and then play out over the remainder of the year and we think about it maybe in the range, call it, 4 acquisitions at roughly $100 million each. And I think they'll look similar to what these other 2 acquisitions that we just completed in 2023 as far as how they will lease up and how they'll -- the drag that we'll see on earnings over 2024.
Brad Hill : Josh, this is Brad. Just to add to that. Our assumption on the acquisitions is that obviously, as Clay mentioned, they're very similar to the ones we purchased last year. They're in lease-up. We're assuming about a 4.5% NOI yield contribution at the time of closing, given that those are in lease up and given the comments that Clay made about where our current commercial paper is and where our cost of debt is you can kind of do the math on what the dilution there is.
Operator: We'll take our next question from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Eric, you remain confident that new lease pricing is going to improve this year, but it really sounds like peak deliveries don't hit until around midyear. And we've really yet to see, I guess, leasing volume pick up, so with kind of that expectation of the improvement in new lease rates for the year, do you think that lease rates get better in the back half of this year versus last year on sort of a lease weighted basis? I know things deteriorate late in the year, but more interested in sort of that period of July through October.
Eric Bolton : Well, I'll answer your question, and Tim you can jump in here. But probably speaking, yes, we do think that as you get into the summer leasing season, we've always traditionally seen leasing traffic pick up. And as commented in our prepared comments, I mean, we just see no evidence of demand really deteriorating. And we do think that normal seasonal patterns will continue to play out. So as we think about supply delivery, and we see it is pretty elevated at this point. And I mean does it go up another 10%? I don't think so. I think that kind of we're in the sort of the peak of the storm from a supply perspective. I feel like right now and a weak demand quarter. And we think that supply now stays high, certainly in Q1 and Q2 and probably even early Q3, it's hard to peg it by month, but we do think that there is a lot of reasons to believe that supply starts to peter out or starts to moderate a little bit as you get into -- particularly into Q4. So we do think that the pressure surrounding supply that will persist will be met with even stronger leasing traffic and demand patterns as we get into the summer as a function of a normal seasonal patterns and therefore, it does lead us to believe that new lease pricing performs better in Q2 and Q3. And as Tim alluded to, we expect -- again, it's a function of normal seasonal patterns that begins to moderate a little bit in Q4.  And the other thing that I would just point out, of course, is that we began to see early effects of supply pressure really in 2023 and particularly in the latter part of 2023, so in some ways, you could also suggest that the prior year comparisons in terms of new lease-over-lease performance starts to get a little bit easier, if you will in the back half of 2024. So collectively, that sort of leads us to the consensus of where we think things are headed. I mean, Tim, what would you add to that?
Tim Argo: Yes. I'll add on to what Eric was saying. If you go back to last year, I mean, our new lease pricing went slightly negative starting in July, and we got to progressively got more so throughout the year. So there is a comp component that plays into this as well. So I do think to answer one of your questions, Austin is that new lease pricing does look better at the end of 2024 as compared to the end of 2023 with those comps, with supply getting a little bit better. Now, I think the improvement won't be as clear to see because it is a lower demand time of the year when you get into November and December, but I think the trends will be positive and really start to play out in 2025.
Austin Wurschmidt: When do you guys think new lease rate growth could turn positive? And then just my second question is, I'm just curious how -- what underlying assumptions in same-store revenue guidance changed the most relative to what you published in November of last year.
Tim Argo: I think likely new lease pricing probably doesn't go positive until 2025. I think it will get close to flat, probably in the middle of this year and the highest demand part of the year. But even in a normal year or a good year, we typically see new lease pricing is negative in the back part of the year. So I think likely, it's early 2025 as we see the flat pressure start to moderate more, so I think that's probably the most likely scenario for new lease pricing. As far as what changed, I mean, it was really, really to earn in, which is based on what we saw in November and December, as I mentioned in my comments, it is pricing really moderated quite a bit, particularly in November and December, which the way we calculate our earn in is just basically saying all right, all the leases that were in place at the end of December 31, if they all price the year for the rest of the year, what would our range growth be in that -- so the earnings more in the 0.5 range, a little bit lower than that range we talked about at NAREIT, but really driven by the new lease pricing in November and December and the pressure we saw from the developers and looking for occupancy and that sort of thing.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital.
John Kim : I wanted to follow-up on that comment you just made on the earn in that basically half of what you expected in November. I realize the blended rates probably seen in lower than expected. But you also mentioned, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the leasing volume was very light fourth quarter is only 16% of leases overall. I'm just trying to understand that impact of the fourth quarter leases and why earn in come down so much in September month?
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean it's basic on that. I mean I think the other -- the other component that played into is we did -- we saw turnover for the year down, but November and December, we had a little bit higher weighting on new lease pricing as compared to renewals. So more new leases in November and December than renewals obviously, with the new lease pricing was a bigger impact on the blended. Now we've seen that shift more so to what we think will happen throughout the course of 2024, which is we're waiting. We think turnover remained down and be weighted a little more towards renewals. So while we have seen new lease pricing improve in January, the blend had improved even more as we've seen more what we think will be the lower turnover component. So it's really just that. Like I said, we're -- that's comparing at the lowest part of it what was the main part of the year, we do expect blended to be positive in 2024. So I think that's calculating loss lease earning whatever you want to call it the end of the summer, certainly the most pessimistic time to look at it, but it was not pricing that drove it.
John Kim : But when you calculate earn in, do you just take the blended lease change for your entire portfolio and just not weighted by number of transactions, such as [inaudible] basically?
Tim Argo: No. We just said when we talked about earn-in, we're just saying, okay, if our total rents were $2 billion at the end of December. And -- or if we take just December, whatever that number was for rent and applied that all the way through 2024, what is the full year growth over 2023. And so where that ends up, can affect that number here now.
John Kim : Okay. My second question is on acquisition yields, which your last 2 were at 55 and 59. How do you see that move towards this year when you see more acquisition activity occur? And your recent bond rate is done at 5.1%. How does that change your view on initial yields that are acceptable to you?
Brad Hill : John, this is Brad. I'll start off with that. Well, certainly, we were fortunate with the 2 acquisitions that we executed in the fourth quarter. And we felt like we got really good pricing on those for the reasons I mentioned really in my comments, but we haven't seen a lot of activity in that area. And so even in the first quarter here in January, we've seen a little bit of an uptick in terms of the deals coming out. We were at NMHC last week and certainly think that volume picks up a little bit as we go through the year. But we haven't seen a lot of opportunities coming that way. Now we do think as we continue to get further into the year that pressure given where interest costs are for the developers, given the supply pressures that they're likely to feel that the urgency from some of these developers to execute on transactions will continue to increase, and we're certainly hopeful that yields additional opportunities. The other thing that we are watching, frankly, is some of the larger equity sponsors and what their exposure is to other sectors, whether that's retail or office and some of them have big exposures to multifamily development and some of them have liquidity needs, which states that they execute transactions in some of the multifamily space. So we're having some discussions with folks like that. We're certainly hopeful that that will yield some opportunities. But I do think that the pricing expectations on the seller side is still a bit lower than where we think pricing needs to be pricing expectations are still low 5s. So we still need to see some movement up in cap rates from where those expectations are for the market to really pick up. So it's an area that we continue to work on. And we do think that there'll be more opportunities as we get through this year.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.
Jamie Feldman : Great. I appreciate all the color on rents and how you think you can inflect more positive, but I guess this is like a case study. If you think about your weakest market, your deepest supply challenged market, and what do you think the pace of rents look like in that market or the kind of the quarterly improvement? Or is it still weak into '25? I think just looking for like the worst-case scenario so we can build on the better.
Tim Argo: Well, I mean I will say when we talked about construction starts that peaked somewhere around the middle of 2022 that is pretty consistent across our markets. There are a few that were a little bit later that or few a little bit earlier than that. So it is a relatively consistent supply wave in terms of the timing Obviously, some markets are getting a lot more supply than others, which drives under overperformance. I mean Austin is the market we talked about forever that is our weakest one right now. I mean it's just getting a tonne of supply, it's very widespread throughout the market, whereas some other markets a little more targeted. So that's 1 that has probably been the worst new lease performance right now. So I mean, I think a market like that will continue to struggle through most of 2024, probably be 2025 before it starts to see a little bit of improvement. But I would say that, again, sort of the cadence of supply is relatively consistent across most of our markets.
Eric Bolton : And just to add to what Tim is saying, while the cadence of supply is fairly consistent, where you do see a lot of differences on occasion is by market, some -- the percent of new supply coming to the market -- as a percent of the existing stock will vary a bit. And then also, you see, of course, market differences in terms of demand and demand drivers. And so in a market like Austin, where it's probably 1 of our -- if not the most oversupplied market that we have or supply high relative to percent of existing stock. It also happens to be one of the strongest job growth markets that we have. And probably, as a consequence of that, we're seeing absorption rates, if you will, probably running higher in Austin than we would in a market like Dallas or some of the others that are also getting a lot of supply, but maybe not quite the level. I think Dallas obviously is getting a lot of job growth. But a market like Jacksonville, where you're not getting quite the level of job growth that you get in a market like Austin, so I think you have to be careful in trying to extrapolate 1 market to the whole portfolio in terms of performance expectations. I sit will vary quite a bit, and that's obviously why we diversify the way we do. As Tim and Brad alluded to in their comments, this is why we also have a mid-tier market component to our portfolio where we're seeing some of these mid-term markets holding up in a much more steady fashion than some of the others. So I think that the question about how quickly any given market steps through the or steps back through the supply pipeline, if you will is going to largely be a function of the demand factors that we see in those markets. And a market like Austin, we think has huge potential long term for us and steps back pretty strong, probably late this year and more likely into early '25.
Jamie Feldman : Okay. That's helpful. Yes. I mean the question is coming from -- I think most of you and most of your peers are thinking that by the end of the year, a lot of these markets are much better. So that's what I'm trying to figure out like what -- so maybe if you guys pick the market, like what do you think is going to be the market that has the most pain for the longest period combining both job growth projections and supply just so we can at least keep our eyes on that to see like this is the worst case.
Tim Argo: Yes. I would put Austin in that group for sure.
Brad Hill : Yes, I'll agree with all. I mean it's just -- it's getting a lot of supply and frankly, without the level of job growth that would be worse off than it is. So getting a tonnes of jobs, but not is going to take some time to work through.
Jamie Feldman : That's helpful. And then thinking about the acquisition opportunities, I mean, you currently have very low leverage versus your peers how high would you be willing to take that leverage if you found the right opportunities? And then what do you view as your absolute buying power right now?
Tim Argo: Yes. I think just from a leverage standpoint, we would be comfortable moving it up to 4.5% to close to 5%. And of course, that would take a lot of time at this -- at the rate that we're looking at these coming through to get to that point. But we would be comfortable taking our leverage up to that point.
Jamie Feldman : Do you have a sense of total dollar amount?
Tim Argo: I think that gets to roughly $1.5 billion.
Operator: We will take our next question from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.
Dan Tricarico : It’s Dan Tricarico on for Nick. Brad, you talked about the improving absorption in the back half of the year. Can you comment on what you're seeing on the demand side, job growth migration that gives you this confidence? Maybe the general economic outlook embedded in the guide? Maybe said another way, what household formation or job growth scenario gets you to the low end of guidance?
Brad Hill : Yes. Well, I'll start out Tim can certainly jump in here. But a couple of points I'll make here on the demand side is definitely the traditional demand drivers that we see, whether it's job growth, population growth, migration trends, all of those are still very, very positive and steady within our region of the country. And those will continue to be significant drivers over the long-term for us. But we also see another dynamic that's kind of at play here. And a big part of that has to do with the single-family market and really has to do with the affordability and the availability that we see there. As Tim mentioned in his opening comments, we've seen a significant decline in the move-outs to buy a home. That's down 20% year-over-year with us. And if you look at the cost of buying a home in our region of the country, it's up significantly over the last couple of years, the monthly cost of homeownership is about 50% to 60% higher than the rents are within our region of the country. So that's a significant hurdle for most people. We've also seen the construction starts in the single-family sector continue to decline. So the inventory level of available single-family continues to decline. And so, we think that's a pushing segment of demand into multifamily. And it's also pushing folks to stay longer in multifamily. We've seen the average tenure of our residents almost 2 years now. So that's got a demand component to it as well. And then we've also seen some preference shift within the demographics that are our rental demographics, honestly, and that is a preference to live alone. And so that also is extending the household formation numbers that we're seeing.  And so all of that really combines to a point that Eric made in his comments, which is that apartment rental continues to make a higher make up a higher percentage of the occupied housing. And so as we look out and see demand in our region of the country, those traditional drivers continue to be important, but there's also this other component that is really adding to the demand component that we see in our region of the country. Tim, what would you add?
Tim Argo: Yes. I'll add a couple of points there. I mean I think the job growth component and how much there is will be probably more likely the factor that determines to your original question, kind of high and low end, that sort of thing. I mean, I think we expect be in migration and all things Brad just noted to be there and that component of demand to be pretty consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of years.  We've dialed in about 400,000 new jobs into our expectations for our markets for '24 that's down certainly from 2023, but still net positive and so expect job reprices in the subnet markets. And encouragingly, if you look at the national job growth numbers from January added, I think, about 350,000 new jobs in January. You compare that back to 2023, the average is about 250,000 a month. So while we do expect job growth to be down some to 2023, the early indications are that it's still holding up pretty well.
Dan Tricarico : That's great color. Follow-up on development. You have 3 or 4 development starts this year, development starts. What markets are those in? And what are underwritten stabilized yields on those? And I guess, along the same line, you talked about Austin being the weakest. You stabilized Windmill Hill in Austin in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense of how that asset leased up versus your expectations? And obviously, a little bit more suburban, but how do you expect that asset to perform within the Austin market this year, given it's expected to be 1 of the weaker markets?
Brad Hill : This is Brad. A couple of comments. On the development side, yes, we do have 3 to 4 starts that we expect this year. 2 in the first half. One of those is in Charlotte. The other one is in the Phoenix Chandler submarket of Phoenix. We've got 2 other ones that we're working on. One is a Phase II in Denver. The other 1 is a Phase II in Atlanta. And in terms of the yields we're seeing there, we are pushing those at the moment to -- we're repricing all of those trying to get the construction cost down to really get to a yield, call it, mid-6s. That's really what our goal is. We have had some success on the project in Charlotte, we've been able to get between 5% and 6% reduction in the construction costs, which really helps support our ability to get that yield. So we feel really good about where we are with those developments. And then the 2 that are late in the year are Phase 2 projects. So we're hopeful that the yields there continue to increase as we get further construction costs out of those as well.  And I'm sorry, the second part of your question, Nick?
Dan Tricarico : The Windmill Hill in Austin in 4Q, how is that -- go ahead.
Brad Hill : Yes, that asset performed extremely well for us. The average rents that we achieved on that asset were almost 24% higher than what we expected. So from a yield perspective, significantly outperformed what we expected. And part of that was you mentioned it's a suburban asset in Austin. Great execution on the property had 2 adjacent lease-ups going on at the same time as it, but we were very patient in how we leased that asset up. We didn't have to offer concessions to meet the market and really perform extremely well there. So I think given the execution on the construction side as well as the leasing side, we did not have to compete quite as much head-to-head with some of the competition that was in that market, and we've got pretty good results there.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Eric Wolfe with Citi.
Eric Wolfe : So I understand your point on comps getting easier through the year, especially in the fourth quarter. But if the largest amount of supply is delivering in the middle of this year, it takes like a year to lease up. I guess why your brands start recovering sort of later this year before the developments are fully leased? Isn't there typically like a compounding effect of the supply?
Tim Argo: Well, I think one is the -- while we're talking about comp later starts peaked in the middle of 2022, it has been pretty steady. So I think we've seen a relatively steady level of supply being delivered over the last several quarters. And then we have the steady level of demand as well. I mean we have seen absorption keep up pretty well, even though supply compounded, as you said, certainly certain markets are a little bit different. But the other thing is middle of the year obviously is the strongest demand component. And so I think the timing of that with the timing of most of our traffic and most of the demand coming in is what we believe keep it from -- we talked about we think new lease pricing has kind of bottomed helps keep it from getting worse than where it is now, just sort of that normal seasonality and all the different demand factors that we've talked about.  And then you'll have a few months after the middle after its peak where there's still pressure, but we typically see it start to drop a few months after the final deliveries, which what gives us some confidence in the back half of the year that we start to see some improvement.
Eric Bolton : And as Tim mentioned, I mean, we also -- I mean, we assume that new lease pricing moderates in the fourth quarter, and that's also what's important to remember, that's also why we stagger our lease expirations the way we do such that we're repricing a smaller percent of leases of the portfolio in that holiday period of November and December.  So I understand the point that you're making, but we feel like that we've accounted for that both in terms of our new lease-over-lease pricing performance expectations, seasonal patterns, if you will, but also just the way we manage lease expirations over the course of the year. So we think that we've got it dialed in appropriately. And we do think that as we get into again, it varies by market so much. So it's hard to make any real conclusive broad observations as it relates to the point that you're making. But we do think that there are certain markets for sure that we begin to see the supply pressures meaningfully moderate in terms of new coming in late in the year, and that begins to establish some early signs of recovery in that new lease pricing performance as we head into 2025.
Tim Argo: I think one more point I'll add just back to the kind of the middle of the year. I mean, we're still dialing in somewhere in the negative 2.5% range during that strongest period of 2024 for new lease pricing. So we certainly don't see getting positives yet. But I think with the demand components that it will be a little bit better than what we're seeing right now.
Eric Wolfe : And then just maybe a quick clarification on the earn in. Does that include your sort of loss or gain to lease a real-time changes in market rents? Or is it based purely off the leases signed up at one point in time? Just trying to understand if like real-time movings and market rents ends up impacting that earnings such that it's always going to end up being low end at the year-end.
Tim Argo: Yes. Well, for the earning like I said, it's basically just saying all the leases that were in place at the end of 2023, so call it all the December leases just held steady for all '24 that's earned in. I mean, loss to lease, how we think about that, if you look at all of the leases that went effective in January compared to our in place, it's about a negative 1% loss lease looking at it that way. But we are dialing it in as we said, positive 1% blended for the course of 2022.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush.
Richard Anderson: So what do you make of this January effect that's happening? Like you guys have seen this sort of recovery in January. Some of your peers, many of your peers have seen the same thing. It's still freak and cold outside. Why do you think January is recovering the way it is for you and others at this point?
Eric Bolton : Two reasons. One, you don't have the holidays in January. I think nobody likes to move during Christmas and or thanksgiving. I think holiday effect is real. And I think it weighs on people's interest in moving.  Secondly, I think that there are -- and we have seen some evidence to suggest that some developers were facing kind of a calendar year-end pressure point. And I think that we -- as we started to see in the early part of the fourth quarter as we were approaching year-end, developer lease-up practices were getting increasingly aggressive, as we're headed towards the holidays. And I think a calendar year-end and so I just think that developer practices got a little bit more aggressive in the holidays and approaching the year-end. I think that to some degree, there was some moderation on that and certainly, absent the holidays, even though it is cold and so forth. I think people's capacity to deal with the hassle of moving just improves a little bit better once you get past the holidays and therefore, traffic picked up.
Richard Anderson: Do you think this holiday factor moderates in February, and it's still sort of a seasonally slow period of time through the January pickup and then you kind of get back to normal course sequential business. Is that fair?
Tim Argo: Yes, I think that's a good reason.
Richard Anderson: And then second question is someone asked about how much you'd lever up and I appreciate that color. And I know you're sort of waiting for transaction market to be sort of more attractive to you to execute with still low cap rates. But you have sort of development opportunity sitting, I don't remember what the number was, but you got a lot that you can do right now. Why wouldn't you, if you're going to deliver into 2026, which is likely to be a very good year to deliver, why not really accelerate development right now and have that be a part of the -- a bigger part of the external growth story. You seem to be slowing it down more than speeding it up at this point. So, just curious on that.
Brad Hill : Rich, this is Brad. Well, you're right, we do have a pretty big pipeline of projects that are ready that we could execute on. And really, it's just a matter of working the costs on those projects right now. I mean, as I mentioned, we are seeing early signs of coming down. On the project in Charlotte, call it, 5% to 6%. We do think we'll continue to see costs come down as we get later into this year. So while we do expect to start 3 or 4 projects this year, we have another 4 to 5 that are approved, were plans are nearly ready. And if costs came in, we could certainly pull the trigger on those. So we have the optionality to be able to do that. But we think it's prudent to be sure that the costs are in line. We do also agree with you that these line up very, very well from a delivery perspective into 2026. The other area where we are seeing opportunity that I think could yield itself more immediately, is in our prepurchase area. So we are talking with developers on a number of opportunities where projects are approved, entitled, plans are complete and in some instances, GMPs are already in place. But given some of the other liquidity constraints out there that I was talking about earlier, and pressures in other sectors, the equity or even the debt has pulled out of the project. So we are evaluating projects in that way. And so if we can find well-located opportunities with good partners that meet our return requirements, we'll definitely lean into that area a little bit more.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb : So two questions, and apologies about the clock in the background. The first one is, can you just talk a little bit about renewals? I think you said you expect them to be sort of 5%, but new rents down 3%, so an 8% spread. Can you just walk us through why that -- that seems a rather wide spread, but in your comments, you said that's sort of consistent with historic. So maybe you could just talk about that and why existing residents would accept an 8% spread versus new residents?
Tim Argo: Yes. This is Tim, Alex. I mean, the gap is a little bit wider than historical, we look at January for example, it's about 1,100 basis point gap for the month. But if you look at last year at this time, it's about 900. And even if you look at over the last several years, really as long as we've been tracking it, Q1 runs about an 800 basis point gap. And even as you get into the spring and summer, there's typically always a gap where we see renewal pricing outperforming new lease pricing. But I mean, I think there's a few reasons for that, frankly, One, there is a real cost, but a hassle cost and a financial cost to moving. There is the customer service component. When we have someone that's lived with us and knows kind of what to expect and knows what kind of service you're going to get. If you look at our Google star ratings. We averaged 4.4 Google star rating in 2023, which is highest in the sector. 80% of our ratings were 5 star and that is a component that plays out, it may offense itself in this way with our renewal pricing. And then we just -- we do dedicate a lot of time in resources to this renewal process. But in our corporate office and on the on-site teams, there's a lot of thought -- there's a lot of factors considered a lot of -- there's a level of buying that we get from our teams that get them comfortable with the rates we're sending out at. And again, that manifests itself well. So it will narrow and as we see new lease pricing, we expect to accelerate as we get into the spring and summer, that gap will narrow. But as I made in the prepared comments, if you look at February, March and even April, we're averaging right around that 5%. So I think that can hang in there, particularly as new lease rates start to accelerate around that same time frame.
Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is on the supply front, it only seems like a handful of your markets have supply issues, but pressure on new rent seems to be broad brushed. And yet, Sunbelt still as good economy, good jobs, good in migration. So how do you like we understand weakness in new rents in markets that have a lot of supply? But how do we interpret rent softness sort of portfolio wide, especially in the market that aren't beset by supply? And clearly, your price point seems to be affordable for the community. So I just want to understand the non-supply markets, why there's been pressure there as well?
Tim Argo: Well, we are seeing pretty good strength. And as I've commented on some of the mid-tier markets, if you think about Greenville and Savannah and Richmond and Charleston in those markets, we are seeing pretty good relative performance. I mean the supply is -- it obviously varies by market, and we're seeing it a lot more in some of the larger markets. And I think, frankly, we're seeing it in some of higher concentration markets. If you think about Austin and Charlotte and Dallas, some of our higher concentration markets is where there's more supply, which is not surprising, there are good markets to be in the sort of good long-term demand markets, and that's not really a surprise.  So I think there's some of that concentration factor that's weighing into it, where those obviously have an outsized impact on what you see at the portfolio level overall. But if you look at 2023, for example, across all of our markets, deliveries were about 4 -- between 4% and 4.5% of inventory across the portfolio. So while it varies pretty widely by market, we did see pretty good. The store leverage is probably 3% to 3.5%. So even for some of the ones that weren't getting tonne of supply, they were still higher than average.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS.
Michael Goldsmith : My first question is on the expense -- on expenses. Can you walk through where -- which line items you're seeing particular pressure? And how you envision expense trending through the year?
Brad Hill : Yes. Just a couple of things around expenses that I'd point to is, one, our uncontrollable expenses are really what's driving some of that expense growth whenever you kind of break that down. Real estate taxes are projected to grow at roughly 4.8% for the year. I think you saw that in our guidance. And then you have insurance that's growing at roughly 16% -- 15%, 16% for the year. So that continues to be a bit of a headwind for us as we go into 2024 and for all the same reasons that we've seen in previous years just as the market is trying to catch up there.  Then when you get into some of our controllable expenses, really the biggest driver there is probably repair and maintenance, while the other items around expenses are pretty much right there at that overall growth rate of 4.1% or actually even slightly lower than that.
Tim Argo: And I'll add just a couple of points there on the controllable. I mean, we do expect that if you look back to 2023 that all of those controllable line items will moderate in 2024 as compared to 2023 pretty significantly, and you can see that in the guide that we have. I think marketing is the one that's a little bit variable. I may not -- we had pretty reasonable marketing costs in 2023. And certainly in the environment we're in, that's something we want to make sure we're careful about to make sure we're properly spending there. So that may be the one where you don't see a significant decrease, but I think the others will see some pretty good moderation.
Michael Goldsmith : And my follow-up is on concessions. How have concessions and competing properties trended? And are you offering any concessions that your stabilized property?
Tim Argo: I mean the concessions for us it stabilized. It's pretty minimal, I think, across the portfolio. We're about 0.5% or so of rents and concessions. And with the way we price, there's a lot of net pricing, we don't do a tonne of concessions. We do see it more in some of the lease-ups that we're competing against. I would say in general, concessions in the market and what we're competing against with went up a little bit in Q4, probably where we saw the biggest change, some of our Carolina markets, Charlotte and Raleigh were ones and we saw concessions pick up a little bit, but still in terms of lease-up and areas of lot development the concession practices is still pretty strong kind of that 1 month to 2 months range.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities.
Haendel St. Juste : Going back to your comments on your 5% renewal rate. I guess, I'm curious if that 5% renewal pricing does hold, but market rate growth is just 1%. Are you creating a [inaudible] and how do you feel about that going into next year in line of the outlook for rental rates to recover?
Tim Argo: You cut out there a little bit but I know you said a gain lease, is that what you were saying?
Haendel St. Juste : Yes, I was saying that if the 5% renewal rate forecast that you should does hold and market rate growth rate is just 1%. Are you creating a gain to lease? And then how would that impact your outlook for next year when you expecting market rates to recover or you rental like your portfolio to recover?
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean, like I said, the gap is a little wider right now, but I expect it to come in. We haven't seen any signs like say, going all the way out to April. We're still kind of in that 5% range. And obviously, depends on the mix and who's renewing his new lease. We typically -- our average stays somewhere in the 20-month range, some money leases and then they do on renewal and typically move it out. So all it is you're not renewing on top of renewing and top of renewing where that gap continues to get larger and larger. But as I said, we've always seen a gap there and a little bit wider right now, but I expect it to narrow as we get into the spring. But no concerns with where we sit here right now.
Eric Bolton : And I'll just add Handel that I mean, over time to the extent that obviously, the new lease pricing pressure we're seeing right now is obviously largely a function of supply coming into the market. If that begins to moderate late this year into 2025 in the event that we do see renewal pricing need to moderate a little bit more next year, call it, instead of 5%, we're in the 3% or 4% range. We also, though, expect new to start to show some improvement next year such that we probably continue to get the blended performance that we need and that we're after. So it's a give and take back and forth.  We've always historically seen new lease pricing in that kind of 4% to 5% range. I don't recall it ever really materially getting a lot lower than that. Maybe there was a year back years ago where it got to 3%, but generally, when that's happening and certainly, we think that will be the scenario this time. By that point, our new lease pricing has started to show some improvements such that the overall blended performance continues to hang in there pretty well.
Haendel St. Juste : I appreciate that Eric. I guess, I'm just thinking ahead and thinking of potentially that renewal rates would need to drop next year, how much CBD unless market rate growth does improve an increase maybe into the mid to single -- upper single-digit rate growth?
Eric Bolton : Yes. 
Haendel St. Juste : One more. I appreciate the color you guys gave on the building box of same-store revenue, but could you give us some color on what you're assuming for bad debt, ancillary and for turnover?
Tim Argo: Haendel, on bad debt, I would -- the way that we're thinking about that is it will remain pretty consistent with where it's run here recently. I mean we'd probably run around that 0.5 percentage point range turnover staying low, at least for our guidance, we're staying low around that 45% range. And then what was the last one that you asked about?
Haendel St. Juste: Fee income.
Tim Argo: Yes, the ancillary income it is growing one. We're assuming it will grow pretty much in line with our overall effective rent growth, so right around that 1% level.
Haendel St. Juste : And then one last one. I think it was last quarter, there's a lot of chatter around A versus B rental pricing and the impact that the new supply was having on that dynamic. Curious if there's any updated perspective, anything that you've seen in this past quarter or any updated views on the performance of A versus B in your portfolio is or has changed over the last quarter or so?
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean we've probably seen it gap a little bit. I mean RRBs, what you would call it these or even if you want to think about suburban versus urban, suburban is outperforming urban kind of the CBD and the interim loop. If you think about suburban, we're probably about 80 basis points better in Q4 January on a blended lease-over-lease basis from what we're seeing on the secondary.  A versus B in the way we think about our portfolio, it's about 55% A, 45% B, a little bit tighter there, probably about a 30 basis point gap with the B is doing a little bit better. Occupancy pretty consistent for both. But I would say the biggest notable thing there is certainly suburban assets are outperforming a little bit of less supply in those areas as well.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
Bradley Heffern : First, I just want to say congratulations to Al. Hope you enjoy your retirement. On your lease-ups, can you talk about how those are going in terms of pace? Obviously, you're outperforming on the [RIN] side, but I'm just curious if they're taking longer than normal just given the supply backdrop?
Brad Hill : Yes, this is Brad. Those are pretty much in line with our expectations. Certainly, there's been a slowdown in the velocity in line with our overall portfolio kind of over the holidays and the winter months. But there's nothing material in terms of difference there versus what we expected. Our day break asset is leasing up a little bit slower and has been. But in general, all of our assets, and that's the one in Salt Lake City. But in general, all of our assets are leasing up pretty much in line with our expectations in terms of velocity, given the slowdown here over the winter season.
Bradley Heffern : Okay. Got it. And maybe I missed it, but can you give your expectation for market rent growth that's underlying the guide? Obviously, you gave the blended assumption, but just looking specifically for the market piece.
Tim Argo: Our blended as we talked about is about 1%. And we really -- we expect market rent, if you will to be pretty consistent with where it is right now.
Bradley Heffern : Sorry, consistent as in flat or consistent as in similar to the 1% number?
Tim Argo: Yes, flat. 1% is what we're expecting in terms of our blending growth.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.
Adam Kramer : Just wanted to -- I think we talked a little bit about capital allocation and potential opportunities with acquisitions or developments very similar question, and again, recognizing where the balance sheet leverage is. So I was just wondering about the opportunity or maybe the appetite for share buybacks here? Or is that something you can consider? And maybe kind of what it would take for that to be under greater consideration.
Eric Bolton : Well, I mean, as you point out, I mean, we do think that attractive acquisition opportunities are going to start merging later this year into 2025 merchant builders continues to struggle with their lease-up more likely than not below what they underwrote. And so we believe for the moment that at current pricing, the longer-term yield performance that we can pick up on acquiring these lease-up properties provides a more attractive long-term investment return, especially on an after CapEx basis as compared to investing in our existing portfolio, our earnings stream. We also see it providing a better ability to continue investing in our new tech initiatives that we think offer the opportunity for meaningful margin expansion over the entire portfolio over the next few years, creating significant amounts of value. And then as you know, I mean, there's a REIT. We've long oriented our thinking around the idea that best way for us to reward shareholders over a long period of time is through the dividend and through earnings growth. And we think that continuing to find ways to put capital to work that supports those first 2 agenda items I just mentioned in supporting our ability to continue to push dividend growth through all phases of the cycle over time is the best way to reward REIT capital. Having said all that, I mean, we obviously continue to monitor the public pricing of our existing portfolio and the company and obviously interested in continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet. I mean if we continue to see dislocation or even more dislocation in terms of public versus private pricing of the real estate. I mean we do have a buyback program in place, authorization in place. We've done it before and we wouldn't hesitate to do it again if conditions warranted it. But for right now, given the outlook and the opportunity we think we have in front of us, we think better to sort of hold on to our powder, we think the long-term value proposition is likely better with the focus that we have.
Adam Kramer : Great. And you mentioned some of the tech investments and kind of the opportunity set there. Maybe just, I don't know, I wonder 2 there that you're very excited about and you're kind of able to share with the public?
Brad Hill : Yes. I mean, this is Brad. You've definitely heard of these in the past, but I'd say number 1 is our continued investment in our CRM platform. And we rolled this out a couple of quarters back when we continue to update and refine that platform, which really allows better management of our prospects and our leasing process. And this is also really an enabler to a number of other things that we're working on, our centralization, our specialization, our potting. All of those things have kind of our CRM platform at the centre of those. We continue to focus on our potting of properties. We've got -- we're up to 27 potted properties today and we'll continue to look to expand that when opportunities present themselves. We're also investing right now and updating our website. We're hopeful that we'll be able to roll this out later this month. And really our goal there is to be able to drive more leasing traffic through our website, which is the most cost-effective way for us to do that. We get a large portion of our traffic now through our website, and we're looking to continue to improve that. We're also really working to optimize our mobile -- our website for mobile use, which will support our online leasing and our self-touring.  The last one that I'll mention is we're rolling out right now a property-wide WiFi on select properties this year. We're also adding this on some of our new developments. And this is really an opportunity for our residents to have really seamless Wi-Fi across our property, whether it's in the unit, common areas, amenities and really provides a better opportunity in service for our residents, and that has a really big revenue component as well that we are testing at the moment.
Operator: And we'll take our last question from the line of James Feldman with Wells Fargo.
James Feldman : I'm sorry to extend an already long call. But you had mentioned an expectation you think rental decline. You've fix amount of exposure to floating rate debt. Can you talk about your -- what's in your guidance in terms of rates this year? And then as of the year-end, you had $500 million on the commercial paper facility. Do you expect to keep that in place all year? Do you think you pay that down? Or is that already paid down?
Andrew Schaeffer : Yes. Jamie, we paid that down in the first week of January with the bond issuance that we completed and that effective rate on that issuance was right up just north of 5%. The place we look to the next dollar is our commercial paper program. And right now, it's at roughly 5.5%, and so we'll keep an eye on that. And as rates are expected to decrease over the back half over the year, we expect that number to maybe come down a bit.
James Feldman : What's your assumption in your guidance for where rates go?
Andrew Schaeffer : Yes, we've got a dropping down 25 basis points through halfway through the year and then another 25 basis points on the very back end of the year.
James Feldman : Okay. So you're down 75 basis points by year-end?
Andrew Schaeffer : Just 50. 25 at the end this year.
James Feldman : Okay. And then you had mentioned a $0.05 drag from developments that are not stabilized yet. Is there any variability to that? Is any of that being capitalized? There couldn't be so much of a hit to earnings?
Andrew Schaeffer : Yes, there is some capitalization there. And when you look at our capital -- interest capitalized year-over-year, a slight increase, but pretty steady. But what really comes into play there is just the timing of the developments. In 2023, we delivered and leased up 2 developments in 2024. We're going to be delivering and leasing up 4 developments. And so you got a bit of a play there that's creating some headwind. And then in general, just the overall the rate at which we're capping that interest comes into play. You're looking at an effective rate, roughly 3.5% that we're capping and then we're borrowing at a higher rate today than what than what we've capped at previously.
James Feldman : Okay. So I guess like even if you have an aggressive lease up or lease up better than expectation, do you think that $0.05 is still locked in? Or there a way that could go away?
Andrew Schaeffer : I mean it would have to be a pretty meaningful change in how that would lease up to really move the needle on that $0.05.
James Feldman : Okay. And then finally, just a clarification. I think you had mentioned 0.85 is your blend assumption. And then you answered the last question with 1%. I know we're splitting here, but is 0.85 still the right number or is it 1%?
Andrew Schaeffer : Yes. So our blended number is 1%. So that's the blended pricing we've got built into our revenue guidance, but our overall effective rent growth is the 0.85%. So that 0.85% includes the earn in that we've got for from 2023 plus the 1% of the blended that we're looking at for 2024.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks.
Eric Bolton : All right. Thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning, and I'm sure speak to many of you over the spring. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-26 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the MAA Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen mode. Afterward, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today October 26th, 2023. I will now turn the call over to Adam Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.
Andrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Brittney and good morning everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, Brad Hill, and Clay Holder. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34x filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplements are currently available on the -- for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Andrew and good morning. MAA's third quarter FFO performance was ahead of our expectations as the demand side of our business continues to capture good leasing traffic, low resident turnover, positive migration trends, and strong collections performance. During the quarter, we did see a higher impact from new supply deliveries across several of our larger markets with the resulting impact showing up in pricing associated with new move-in residents, while we continue to believe that MAA's unique market diversification a more affordable rent structure and an experienced and capable operating platform will enable us to push back against some of the supply pressure. The high volume of new deliveries in several markets will continue to weigh on rent growth associated with new resident move-ins for the next few quarters. Encouragingly, there is now clear evidence emerging that new supply deliveries are poised to meaningfully drop late next year into 2025. We have certainly worked through these supply cycles before and continue to believe that MAA's more extensive market and submarket diversification new AI and technology tools and an experienced operating team has us in a position to outperform our markets. As we have discussed previously one of the benefits that typically emerges from a heavy supply cycle particularly one that is characterized by higher interest rates is an increasing volume of acquisition and external growth opportunities. We have seen a shift take place with seller and developer pricing expectations. The more challenging lease-up conditions coupled with higher interest rates that are likely to be with us for a while are generating more buying opportunities. As Brad will recap in his comments the property acquisition we completed after quarter end is a good example of where we expect more opportunities to emerge specifically a recently completed new development that is still in initial lease-up with seller requirements to close within a short timeframe. Before turning the call over to the team to provide details surrounding our performance and market conditions, let me summarize what I believe are the four key takeaways in our report. First, demand across our markets remain solid and supportive of steady absorption of the new supply. Secondly, current high levels of new supply coupled with developer pressures related to the higher interest rate environment will cause the leasing environment to remain competitive for the next few quarters with new supply pressures expected to then decline. We expect to see an increasing number of compelling external growth opportunities in 2024. And four, MAA's long track record of performance and experience in working with markets with higher demand and supply dynamics now further supported by a stronger technology platform and a strong balance sheet with significant capacity has the company in very well position as we work through the current cycle. And with that I'll now turn the call over to Brad.
Brad Hill: Thank you, Eric and good morning everyone. As anticipated we saw an increase in for-sale marketing activity emerge early in the third quarter. And while closed transactions are limited in number, we continue to see some upward pressure on cap rates on projects we track, with cap rates up by roughly 15 basis points from 2Q. As indicated in our earnings release, we recently closed the Phoenix market that we began pursuing early in 3Q. MAA Central Avenue is a 323-unit mid-rise property that fits the profile of the type of opportunities we expected to emerge. The property is in its initial lease-up and the seller was under some pressure to close on the sale by a specific date. So, counterparty risk considerations were paramount to the seller. Our familiarity with the market, speed of execution and balance sheet strength that supports an ability to close all cash with no financing contingencies were all aspects of our offer that were very important to the sellers. Our pricing of approximately $317,000 per unit is substantially below current replacement costs and is expected to provide an initial stabilized NOI yield of 5.5%. With the property nearing stabilization, we expect over the following year or so to capture further margin and yield expansion opportunities as a result of adopting MAA's more sophisticated revenue management practices and technology platform coupled with our future ability to achieve operational synergies with another MAA property that is only half a mile away. Our transaction team is very active in evaluating other acquisition opportunities across our footprint. And Al and Clay have our balance sheet in great position to be able to take advantage of additional compelling opportunities as they continue to materialize later this year and into 2024. Despite pressure from elevated supply our new properties in their initial lease-up continued to deliver strong performance producing higher NOIs and earnings than forecasted creating additional long-term value for the company. These properties on average have captured in-place rents 15% above our original expectations. For the five properties that are either leasing or will start leasing by the end of the year this rent outperformance which is partially offset by higher expenses including taxes and insurance is estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 6.7% significantly higher than our original expectations. Leasing has progressed well at MA Windmill Hill in Austin and we expect this community to stabilize this quarter. We continue to advance predevelopment work on several projects, but due to some permitting and approval delays three projects that we plan to start this year will likely instead start in early 2024. In a number of markets -- in a number of our markets, construction costs have been slower to adjust than we expected, but we continue to see signs that a broader reduction in cost is likely to come. Numerous consultants that we work with including architects and engineers have indicated their volume of work has significantly decreased in the last few months providing further evidence of a decline in new construction activity. Additionally, general contractors are indicating they have more capacity to start new projects and in many cases with a larger pool of subcontractors available. In addition to the three projects mentioned that we expect to start over the next six months, we have five more projects representing approximately 1,320 units that could be ready for construction start by the end of 2024. Our team has done a tremendous job building out our future development pipeline. And today we own or control 13 well-located sites representing a growth opportunity of nearly 3700 units. We have optionality on when we start these projects allowing us to maintain our patience and discipline when making capital deployment decisions. Any project we start in 2024 will deliver units into a stronger leasing environment with lower competitive supply in late 2025 and 2026. Our development team continues to evaluate land sites as well as additional prepurchase development opportunities. In this more constrained liquidity environment we are hopeful that we may find additional development opportunities to add to our future pipeline. In addition to continuously monitoring the construction market and evaluating costs at our projects in predevelopment, our construction management team is focused on completing and delivering our remaining five under construction projects. During the third quarter the team successfully wrapped up construction on novel West Midtown in Atlanta completing the delivery of all 340 units. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that I'll turn the call over to Tim.
Tim Argo: Thanks, Brad and good morning. Same-store revenue growth for the quarter was essentially in line with our expectations with sequentially higher occupancy offsetting sequentially declining new lease pricing. Increasing supply pressure did impact pricing in some of our markets resulting in a blended lease over lease pricing of 1.6% comprised of new lease rates declining 2.2% and renewal rates increasing 5%. Average physical occupancy was 95.7% resulting in revenue growth of 4.1%. The various metrics we measure related to demand remained strong. Employment markets remained stable with continued job growth across our Sunbelt markets. Net positive migration trends to our markets continue with move into our footprint well ahead of move-outs outside of our footprint and remain consistent with what we have seen in the last several quarters. Resident turnover was down once again in the third quarter a 4% decrease from prior year. Collections remained strong and consistent with prior quarters. Our new resident rent-to-income ratio remained low and in line with prior quarters and our lead volume is consistent with what we would expect and in line with pre-pandemic levels. But as mentioned, we did feel the impact of new supply in the third quarter which manifested itself in lower new lease pricing particularly beginning in August and September. This pressure was driven by higher concession uses by developers in many of our markets with the resulting reduction in net pricing in a number of our direct market comps. This peer pricing movement obviously does impact market pricing it impacts our asking rents. We believe the lingering higher interest rate environment with the 10-year treasury moving up quickly in the third quarter is driving merchant developers to get more aggressive on pricing and is creating some pockets of pricing pressure. Historically with typical seasonality pricing tends to moderate some in Q3 as compared to Q2 and then moderating quite a bit more from Q3 to Q4 typically in the 200 basis point range. While we did see a greater degree of moderation in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter with the solid demand factors mentioned previously we expect less moderation than normal from Q3 to Q4. October to date Blend and lease-over-lease pricing is zero which is within 10 basis points of what was achieved in September and a lower rate of decline than the more typical 60 basis points. Average physical occupancy for October month to date remains strong at 95.6% with exposure which is a combination of current vacancy and units on notice to vacate up 6.9% and in line with October of last year. In addition to the demand factors mentioned increased absorption through the third quarter in the Sunbelt markets provides further evidence of continued solid demand to help mitigate the impact of the continuing new deliveries. The amount of new supply that was absorbed in the third quarter in our markets was the highest it has been since the beginning of 2022. Despite the new supply pressure in some markets, our unique portfolio strategy to maintain a broad diversity of markets submarkets asset types and price points is serving us well with many of our mid-tier markets leading the portfolio and pricing performance both in the third quarter and into October. Savannah Charleston, Richmond Greenville and Raleigh are examples of markets outperforming larger metros with more new supply pressures such as Austin and Phoenix. We expect this market diversification combined with the continued strong demand fundamentals noted earlier will help continue to mitigate some of the impact of new supply as compared to a less diversified portfolio. Regarding redevelopment, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives in the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2023, we completed nearly 2,300 interior unit upgrades and are nearing completion on the Smart Home initiative with over 92,000 units now with this technology. For our repositioning program we have five active projects that have either begun repricing or will begin repricing in the fourth quarter with expected yields in the 8% range. Additionally, we are evaluating an additional group of properties to potentially begin construction later in 2023 or early in 2024, with the target to complete by early 2025. That's all I had in the way of prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Clay.
Clay Holder: Thank you Tim and good morning. Reported core FFO for the quarter of $2.29 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. The outperformance was primarily driven by favorable interest and overhead costs during the quarter. Overall same-store operating performance for the quarter was in line with our expectations. Same-store revenues were slightly ahead of expectations as average occupancy was better than forecasted. The increase in occupancy was offset by the moderation of effective rent growth on new move-in leases as Tim mentioned. As expected, we began to see some moderation in same-store operating expense growth during the third quarter. However, this moderation was less than what we had forecasted. Personnel costs came in higher than expected, primarily due to higher contract labor costs and higher leasing commission, which helped drive the improvements in occupancy. The personnel costs were partially offset by real estate taxes that were favorable to our forecast for the quarter. We received more information related to the Texas state legislation that was passed in the quarter that reduced property tax rates in the state. Our projection for real estate taxes for the full year remains unchanged. During the quarter, we invested a total of $19.7 million of capital through our redevelopment repositioning and smart rent installation programs. Those investments continue to produce strong returns and add to the quality of our portfolio. We also funded just over $47 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $643 million pipeline leaving $296 million remaining to be funded on this pipeline over the next two years. As Brad mentioned, we also expect to start several new projects over the next 12 to 18 months which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility providing significant opportunity to fund potential investment opportunities. Our leverage remains historically low with the debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 3.4 times, and at quarter end our debt was 100% fixed for an average of just over seven years at a low average interest rate of 3.4%. In October, we refinanced $350 million of maturing debt utilizing cash on our balance sheet and our commercial paper program. Our current plan is to continue to be patient and allow interest rates and financing markets to stabilize before refinancing. That's all I have for my prepared comments and I'll turn it over to Al to discuss Q4 guidance.
Al Campbell: Thank you, Clay, and good morning everyone. Given the third quarter performance outlined by Clay as well as expectations for the remainder of the year we have updated and narrowed our guidance ranges for the year which is detailed in the supplement to our release. Overall, the third quarter core FFO favorability primarily related to overhead and interest costs is expected to be essentially offset by higher-than-projected same-store operating expenses for the remainder of the year, which I'll discuss a bit more in just a moment. Thus, we're maintaining the midpoint of our core FFO projection for the full year of $9.14 per share which reflects a 7.5% growth over the prior year. The midpoint of our total revenue growth projection for the year remains unchanged as the expected impact of pricing moderation, which is reflected in effective rent growth is largely offset by the increase in projected average occupancy for the year. However, we have increased our guidance for same-store operating expense growth for the full year by 45 basis points to 6.5% at the midpoint, primarily reflecting the continued pressure in labor costs partially related to building higher occupancy. Both personnel and repair and maintenance costs are expected to moderate more as we move into 2024. While we maintained our full year guidance range for real estate taxes, we are impacted by some timing-related pressure during the fourth quarter, as some of the initial favorability related to the Texas rate reduction is essentially offset by delays in litigation related to high valuations, which is being pushed into next year. We do expect real estate taxes overall to continue moderating over the next couple of years, as we work through the changing cap rate environment. We also reduced our total overhead cost projection for the year by $2 million to $126.5 million at the midpoint and we removed our disposition expectations for the current year, to reflect the current market conditions. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. Brittany, will now turn the call back to you for questions.
Operator: We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is open. 
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is just on the impact of the merchant builders delivering into a higher supply higher rate environment? It seems like it's changed the lease-up strategy. So I guess, is the largest impact here that rental rates have gone -- have moved lower and will remain lower longer. And so I guess, in initial expectations. So will this -- does this create more pressure in the near term and also for longer? Or is it just kind of a lower dip, before it gets better kind of seems like back half of 2024 early 2025.
Tim Argo: I mean I don't think it necessarily means longer. I think what did happen as we talked about it happened a little bit quicker. And I think the comments, I made about the treasury and developers get more aggressive called that moderation of new lease rates to occur a little bit earlier than we would have thought or a little bit quicker really. But we don't see much further deceleration. I think what we see is with renewal rates continuing to be strong, we're getting 5% on what we've set out or what we've got acceptance on for November and December the 5% range. The spread between new lease rates and renewal rates is pretty typical honestly, for this time of the year and tends to gap out both in Q4 and Q1. I think as you get into later into 2024, there will be some normal seasonality that will narrow that gap, but we'll be in this supply environment for the next few quarters, but don't expect materially worsening from here.
Michael Goldsmith: Got it. And are you seeing any difference in the performance between your Class B properties with your price stated discounted supply versus the Class A, which should be competing more in line with where the new supply is coming in? Like where is the pressure hitting the hard. Thank you.
Tim Argo: At a portfolio level, we're not seeing a huge difference between the performance of As and Bs. I will say at a market level some of our larger markets that are getting more of the supply we're seeing a little more pressure on some of those B+ A- assets where that gap has narrowed. But I do think that creates some opportunity longer term. Those new developments are going to stabilize, at some point at higher rents and that will create some opportunities there. But in some of our more mid-tier markets, smaller markets that are getting quite the supply pressure we're not seeing that pressure.
Eric Bolton: And I think it's worth noting that, even at the -- use of concessions is happening by some of the merchant developers, in the third quarter. The price gap between what we're seeing of the new product delivering in the market with those concessions as compared to the average rent in our portfolio, is still a spread of $300. That's down a little bit from $350 million, we saw in Q2 but it's still a pretty healthy spread there.
Michael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in the fourth quarter
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thank you. Last quarter Eric, you had mentioned, that you really didn't expect new lease rate growth to drop off and kind of highlighted that demand remained strong. So I guess, is it just been the cumulative impact of supply and concessions on lease-ups that's driven the softness? And really, how does that change your view around how 2024 market rent growth could shape up?
Eric Bolton: Well, Austin, I think that as Tim alluded to I mean the thing that frankly, was a little bit surprising in the third quarter was the more aggressive practices, taking place by some of the merchant developers that was directly impacting some of our product in some of the larger markets. We do think that there's -- it's interesting we were looking at just sort of what happened during the third quarter in terms of the sort of rapid ramp-up, of the junior treasuries. And -- and I think as developers are facing particularly merchant builders, who are facing a more competitive leasing landscape, with the reality of a prolonged high interest rate environment there was a motivation if you will to get pretty darn aggressive and trying to get leased up before we got into the holiday season. And so that affected market dynamics in some of our markets, and I think cause new lease pricing to moderate a little quicker than we would have otherwise thought, just because these merchant builders are a little bit of an urgency to get stabilized sooner rather than later. And so I think that that performance we think likely probably continues at some level probably for the next couple of quarters or so. As Tim mentioned, we don't – given the strong absorption that we see happening overall across our markets. It's hard to see it getting any worse than what we kind of saw in Q3. And then we're encouraged by the fact that October performance in the normal seasonal pattern that we see from Q3 to Q4 frankly is better than what we have seen in the past. So I mean there are reasons for us to feel that we think that the environment we find ourselves in right now is likely to sort of continue for a while probably through – I'm guessing through Q2 of next year. By the time we get to Q3 of next year comparing against this year we think that the – that things start to feel a lot more comfortable. Now we'll have the compounding effect of Q3, Q4, Q1 that we have to carry and kind of work through revenue performance through most of next year. But we think that there's arguments to be made that the supply-demand dynamics that we see taking place right now are likely to sort of hang where they are for the next few quarters but not get materially weaker.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. And so I mean I guess that kind of went to my second question was it sounds like you think demand remains stable from here which has actually been fairly strong. I think even accelerated the last couple of quarters and helped absorb some of the supply. I mean is it fair to say that you think you get some level of market rent growth positive next year, despite kind of this cumulative impact based on your thoughts on how demand shakes out.
Eric Bolton: Yes, we do. I mean assuming that the economy continues to hold up as it is. We continue to capture the sort of tailwind that we're seeing with low resident turnover lower levels of move-outs to buy homes. Collections continue to remain strong. I mean there's just – as I've said for many years – to me at the end of the day what really drives performance over long haul is the demand side of the business. And that can – in the that's why we've always focused our capital in the way we have across the Sunbelt markets believing that the demand dynamic continues to provide a foundation for how we like to create value and drive performance over a long period of time. We have to deal with this periodic supply pressure that comes from time to time and that's kind of what we're dealing with right now. But because of the demand side being as strong as it is the absorption continues to be where it is and because of the approach that we take with diversification across the region we think there are things that we can do to help sort of mitigate some of the supply pressure that you otherwise might think would – if you look at just overall market dynamics we think that when you put the portfolio together the way that we have that we can push back against some of these supply pressures when they do occur from time to time. So I think that – we think that as we get into the back half of next year that we probably do start to see supply levels start to moderate and some of the developer pressures start to moderate. We will probably do start to see market rent growth turn positive on the new lease pricing. And then as Tim mentioned, we continue to get pretty solid performance on our renewal practices. And if you go back over a number of years you'll see that our renewal practices have always been fairly strong. And we take a certain approach to how we think about renewal pricing and we continue to believe that that will remain a tailwind for us over the coming year.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks, Eric. Appreciate the detail response.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Your line is now open
Eric Wolfe: Hey, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the answer there. You said that you don't expect new lease rates to get much worse from here. So I don't want to put words in your mouth but does that mean you're sort of expecting like negative 4% to negative 5% new lease for the foreseeable future? And should that continue through Q2 next year? Because it sounds like you're saying that what the dynamic you're seeing today should continue to 2Q and then probably get better as you get into the back half of the year?
Tim Argo: Hey, Eric, this is Tim. I mean I do think new lease rates probably hang in this range for a few months. Obviously, typically Q4 and Q1 are kind of weakest in terms of seasonality and the amount of traffic and all that. But I do think we will see some level of – and Eric hit on this a little bit some level of normal seasonality as we get into later to 2024. So I think as we get into March and April in the spring and the higher traffic volumes that we'll see some acceleration in those new lease rates. And I don't expect much change in renewals. We've been pretty consistent with our renewal rates going back for several years. We think those will hold up and we think the turnover rate remains low which provides the renewal side with more of that blend when you think about when the lease of our lease rates. So I think we're going to be in this range for a few months but I don't think it sticks like that for the next fall.
Eric Bolton: And we typically see the gap between new lease pricing on renewal pricing sort of gap out the most in Q4 and Q1, and then it tends to narrow in Q2 and Q3. And we think that that seasonal pattern is likely to repeat next year.
Eric Wolfe: Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess that's my second question, which is that historically, I think you said, there's been about 500 to 600 basis points of spread on renewals versus new leases. There's nothing that would sort of change that just based on the supply dynamic today. It's not going to get wider or necessarily thinner. It's just -- it's probably going to be about the same spread as typical.
Tim Argo: Yes. And to clarify or put some color on that that 500 spread for us typically is what it is in the summer and kind of Q2, Q3 range with renewals remaining pretty consistent. Historically, Q4, Q1, Q4 is usually the biggest. It's usually in the 900 basis point range kind of similar to what we're seeing right now and then squeeze down to call it $700, $800 in Q1 and then get more on that 500 basis point range during the heart of the spring and summer. So, I don't really see -- that's the normal seasonality and would expect that to recurring some levels.
Eric Wolfe: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jamie Feldman: Great. Thank you and thanks for taking my question. So, it sounds like you could see a ramp-up here in acquisition activity investment activity. You had mentioned the Phoenix acquisition at $317,000 per unit. You also talked about a 5.5% yield. As you think about deals, I mean what are the metrics that you care about? Is it price per unit? Is it AFFO accretion? Is it NAV accretion? And then how do you think about your cost of capital and the required spread on your cost of capital is to put money to work?
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean the thing that we really prioritize more than anything is sort of what sort of stabilized yield do we think we will get from making a new investment and how does that compare to our current cost of capital. And as you think about cost of capital today and look at sort of where we are able to put our balance sheet to work at, call it, 5.5%, you think about longer perspective on cost of capital being a function of dividend yield and sort of FFO yield, core FFO yield. You blend that, you're still in that kind of 5.5% range. And so as we think about deal that we did in Phoenix. I mean the opportunity to put a brand new asset on the balance sheet that is going to be we think a great performer for us long-term to put that on the balance sheet initially. Even though it's still in sort of an initial lease up to be able to bring it on the balance sheet at basically right at our cost of capital with full understanding that we've got some real operating upside opportunity that we can capture over the first year or so from our revenue management practices and some of the cost efficiencies that we'll bring to bear on an operation that doesn't have those advantages coupled with the fact as Brad mentioned, this property is only -- it's less than half off of one of our other properties and we will over the next year or so pod, what we refer to as pod this property with the other and drive down some of the operating costs. We think over the next couple of years that we'll see that yield meaningfully go up from there. So we think at this point that makes a lot of sense to us. And I think that we're going to continue to we think see more of that opportunity emerge over the coming year.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. And can you quantify how much you think the yield goes up with the revenue management and including the MAA touch on these assets?
Eric Bolton: I'd probably put it at, at least 100 basis point margin expansion to probably 200 somewhere in that range.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. And then secondly, you may have answered it with Eric's question but just thinking about October, I mean what can you tell us about rent blended rent new renewal rent so far in October?
Tim Argo: Yes, this is Tim. So for October as I mentioned the blended is right around zero. We're at about negative 5.3 on new lease and 4.4 on renewals as we stand right now.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. And then finally for me, Atlanta, specifically can you talk about -- I mean you had kind of below average revenue growth there. Is that pressure on rents from supply? Or is that more about some of the issues you've mentioned in the past fraud, some of the other kind of unique factors to that market?
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean, there's certainly a few unique factors in Atlanta and what you mentioned as part of that. I mean it's pricing, pricing is a little bit weak. It's a little bit lower than I would say some of our portfolio average. There we're getting some of the supply pressure that a lot of the other markets are getting as well. I think what we're seeing in Atlanta is a little more on the occupancy side. No, it has -- it is slowly improving. We saw a 40 basis point increase in occupancy from Q2 to Q3 in Atlanta. But there are a couple of unique circumstances that you mentioned, one, if you remember earlier in the year we talked about between the winter storm and a fire we had in Atlanta. We had a lot of down units that came on sort of late first, early seconds. So we were kind of working through that from an occupancy standpoint and then, has been well documented by a lot of people at some of the fraud concerns in Atlanta. And I think that's starting to work itself through as well. The courts are becoming a little more -- a little more aggressive on that. And we've seen the number of cases [ph] that we had in that market is about double from where it was last year. So, create some pressure in the short-term on occupancy but certainly longer term, in terms of revenue quality and ability to pay is much better. And we've also been able through in-house training we've done and really focused on fraud income. We've seen the number of people coming into the door we think is with that scenario is much less and we've seen our number of age balances we have in terms of residence is way down and just the amount of delinquency we have in Atlanta is way down. So some unique circumstances there for sure, but we think it's headed in the right direction.
Jamie Feldman: Okay. And as you think about those factors is it -- if you pause on it being your largest market? I mean over the long term is that a reason you'd want to shrink there or grow in other markets more?
Eric Bolton : Well ,I mean, we continue to look at all the markets we probably over the next number of years we'll you'll probably see us continue to cycle some capital out of the Atlanta. It's going to be more driven by asset-specific decisions, property-specific decisions. I mean, we continue to like the Atlanta market long-term. A lot of great job growth drivers and demand drivers in that market. It's like all the other markets they will go through periods of supply pressure from time to time. But the demand dynamics there are pretty healthy. And I think some of the things that Tim is alluding to that were unique to Atlanta really are attributable to some of the practices that were adopted during the COVID years and the court systems there got really sort of backlog if you will and it's just taking longer for that market to sort of work back to normal. We see it happening. But we like the Atlanta market long term for sure. 
Jamie Feldman: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Nick Yulico : Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get your loss to lease if you're able to quantify that.
Tim Argo : Yes, Nick, this is Tim. So a couple of comments there. If you look at sort of where we are right now and what's going to earn in or be baked in for next year with pricing today plus the pricing that we're assuming for Q4 probably have one to 1.25 of baked in or earned in if you will that will flow into 2024. Think about loss lease and just in terms of kind of where rents are right now it's probably about a negative one of lease given what we've seen with new lease rates right now that's where I would peg it in year in October. 
Nick Yulico : Okay. It's very helpful. Just one other question. Going back to the acquisition and the 5.5% initial stable yield. Is that number impacted by concessions reducing that yield? I don't know if there's any way you can quantify like whether that would be a higher yield absent as there's concessions.
Brad Hill : Hi. Nick, this is Brad. Yes I mean that's inclusive of concessions. The property is in lease-up and it's offering about a month to six weeks generally on new leases. And so that includes the impact of that. So that would be your net effective rent. So assuming that we get to stabilization we would see some strengthening there and the use of concessions would generally burn off on renewals. We're not using -- generally using concessions on these properties. We would also see some expansion in that yield at that point.
Nick Yulico : Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from John Kim with BMO. Your line is open.
John Kim: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about the impact of rising interest rates on leasing demand and landlord behavior. I know you commented that the demand has been strong. You had an occupancy pickup in the third quarter. So when you when you discuss new lease growth rates of minus 4% in September and minus 5.3% in October it seems to coincide with the interest rate environment. I just wanted to get your comment on that.
Eric Bolton : I think what we think is at play here is that in this environment with a lot of these merchant-built properties currently in lease-up the lease-up environment and the financing environment that they are facing today is most assuredly not what they contemplated when they started construction two years ago. And as a consequence of that I believe that what is happening is that some of the merchant-built product is in a rush to get stabilized as quickly as possible preferably before we even get into the holiday season which is why I think there was a lot of noticeable shift that took place in August and September because it's probably -- they're probably late in their time line in terms of what they forecast and what they underwrote. And certainly they are going to face an exit or refinancing that is going to be different than what was contemplated. And while there may have been some early hope that we would start to see moderation in interest rates by this time. I think that hope is now gone. And we likely are in this rate environment we are in today for quite some time moving forward. So I just think that all that is combined to create we knew in a highly high supply environment that lease-up pressure exists but I think it's just been a little bit more intense because of what's going on with the interest rate environment. And therefore, it's manifesting itself in more competitive pricing practices in an effort to attract new residents and leasing traffic. So I think that that's what's at play here. I think that once we sort of work through this scenario that as we've been talking about the supply picture starts to get a lot better, meaningfully better. And we think that we just got to put our head down and operate through this for the next -- in the next couple of quarters or so.
John Kim: Can you comment on your turnover rate which declined 40 basis points? And remains in historically low levels, and how you are able to maintain this turnover rate with all the new supply that's coming online and if you're contemplating offering concessions I don't know.
Tim Argo: Hey, John. This is Tim. I mean, as far as the turnover I mean, we expected -- we certainly didn't really expect to turn over to scale up with all the factors that we see at play. I mean, between move-outs by house and move-outs for a job change those are far and away our two biggest reasons for move-outs. And as expected the move out by house is way down. So we don't see that again given the interest rate environment, we don't see that changing any time near term. Some of the other things that drove move out or turnover up last year are down. So I would expect as we get into 2024 that there's not a lot of change in terms of turnover certainly no significant increase in turnover, so I think that serves us well on the renewal side, that certainly we wouldn't need to look and do anything more than we're doing now on that renewal.
Eric Bolton: Encouragingly, I'll add in the third quarter the move-outs that we had that occurred due to rent increase were half of what they were in Q3 of last year. So what's really at play here on the turnover is just people are buying houses.
John Kim: Great. Thank you, everyone, and Al congratulations on your retirement.
Al Campbell: Yeah. Thank you, John. I'm excited about the prospects for the future, but also excited about what the company is going to do over the next few quarters and years as well.
John Kim: We have the company in good hand. Thank you.
Al Campbell: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yeah. Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow up on a comment you made. It sounds like you're a bit surprised just by the competition from the new supply. I guess what is most surprising to you?
Eric Bolton: Well, we're not surprised by the competition from new supply. What we're surprised by is how aggressive some of the merchant developers have gotten in an effort to expedite their lease-up sooner than getting stabilized as quick as possible. And as I've commented on,k we think that that is related to what is clearly now an indication relating to interest rate trends. And we saw the behavior with lease-ups and concessions begin to shift a bit in August and September as the 10-year treasury really started moving up to 5% close to 5%. And I think it just triggered a urgency and developers that have lease-up projects on their books to get stabilized and get out of it or get it as soon as possible. So I think that that's what's a play here. And that -- so the -- that was probably the only thing that it was. The only thing I can point to that was a bit of a surprise. We expect the demand to remain solid and it is as Tim alluded to our desorption numbers across our markets are really strong. We've not seen any moderation on the demand side of the curve. We knew the supply picture. I mean there is no secret about that. We've seen that coming for the past year or so. So no real surprises there. It's really just the behavior of some of these lease-up projects and the motivation that they have to get leased up sooner rather than later. And I think that that goes right back to what I've just mentioned is that the recognition that the high rate environment we find ourselves in the interest rate environment is likely to be with us for a while. And I think it just prompted some actions on behalf of developers to get drop pricing introduce more concessions higher concessions drive down net effective pricing quicker which affected market dynamics to some degree.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. I appreciate that color. And maybe just a follow-up on that. If I think through it pretty sure peak deliveries are still in 2024. Is your assumption that this aggressive behavior kind of continues? Because I mean, I would assume that there's more properties coming online and the interest rates keep going higher they would want to kind of lease up as quick as possible. Do you think this competition gets heavier in 2024? Maybe that's my question there.
Eric Bolton: It's hard to say for sure, but the short answer is no I don't think so. [indiscernible] that is I think that where there is an urgency that's come into equation and a higher level of urgency by developers. I think to some degree a lot of it may be time to some calendar year-end pressures that they may be thinking about. I think that that perhaps is at play here a bit. When you think about supply levels being where they are, we don't it's -- of course it varies a lot by market. And we think that -- that the supply levels and deliveries that are taking place are likely to be fairly consistent to where they are right now for the next couple of quarters or so call it through Q2 of next year. And so it's hard to pinpoint it exactly but I don't think that there is a material change in the supply dynamic that we're seeing today. I don't think there's a material change in the demand dynamic that we see taking place today. And I think that the only change was if you will just that lease-up pressure that I think some of the developers were feeling given what's going on with the interest rates. And I think perhaps that there is some at least some of them that are facing some calendar year-end obligations that they're trying to think through as well.
Brad Hill: Hey Josh this is Brad. I'll add color in two ways to that. Number one is just remember that developers are incentivized to lease up and sell quickly. Their IRRs are impacted obviously the sooner they sell an asset. And I think partly what's happened on these projects is according to our math generally they have to be about 90% occupied to cover their current debt service coverage through their cash flow without having to go back to their partner and ask for capital. So, to Eric's point I think once 10-year hit that psychological level of 4%. It was a realization that sales values are going to be impacted. So the sooner they could get to that point, the better for their IRR calculations and also for the waterfalls in those projects. So, I think that's driving to Eric's point by the end of the year and a quicker process of leasing up to cover debt service coverage and get to the point where they could transact the asset in order to drive higher waterfall promotes to themselves.
Joshua Dennerlein: All right. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Clay do you expect any notable acceleration or deceleration in the major expense categories throughout the next year?
Clay Holder: We do expect that there will be some moderation in operating expenses going into next year. You saw in the report that personnel costs and repair and maintenance costs were higher than what we had expected or projected but we still do expect those to continue to moderate as we move into next year.
John Pawlowski: Roughly 6% property tax growth rate do you expect it to kind of bounce around this level for the foreseeable future?
Clay Holder: Probably -- that will probably moderate a little bit as well as the current environment that we're seeing with high prices and valuations as those begin to kind of taper down that should work its way through the real estate taxes. And so we expect to see some moderation there as well. How fast that will play through that remains to be seen.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Last one for me Tim. Hoping you can give us a sense for what new lease declines in October look like in a few of the most heavily supplied markets. I'm just curious what the kind of the bottom tranche of the portfolio looks like.
Tim Argo: New lease rates for October -- is that what you're saying John?
John Pawlowski: For the most heavily supplied markets.
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean Austin continues to be the worst and we've talked about that for a while. Austin is in the high negative single-digits is our worst market in terms of new lease pricing. We like I said same-store level it's right around right around 5% for October. Tampa is a little bit higher but also is the one that kind of stands out above all.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you for the time.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Brad Heffern: Hey good morning everybody. It seems like the message here is that there are a few weak quarters ahead but the things are expected to get better in the back half of 2024. I'm just curious if you can give more color around what gives you confidence in that timing you do obviously have supply peaking in mid-2024, but it does still look elevated into 2025 and then the lease-ups don't end when the deliveries fall off. So curious for any thoughts there?
Eric Bolton: Well I think that what I would point to Brad this is Eric is just we continue to see a lot of support on the demand side and the absorption rates that we see taking place remain very healthy. And so I think that all the factors that are sort of supporting the demand side of the business the employment markets, low turnover, solid collections performance, wage growth, all those factors -- continued net positive migration trends. All those factors continue to look solid and there's nothing that we can see suggesting that moderation is set to occur in that regard. I think that as we sort of work through the current pipeline of deliveries that some of the behavior that is occurring right now likely starts to moderate a little bit as some of the more stressed lease-ups get sort of work through the system and some of the developers – one of the most pressure if you will sort of get work through the system. And then of course, as we start to get into the back half of next year, we've been through a complete cycle if you will with this pressure and the comparisons to the prior leases and the comparisons to the prior year start to get a little bit more tolerable if you will. So I just think that we feel like that we've got call it two or three quarters of this environment. You've got seasonal patterns at play here too. You recognize that the Q3 is the point of the year where moderation has typically always occurred anyway from a leasing perspective and then it sort of works through Q4 and then by Q1, particularly, in February and particularly in March things start to pick up and then you get into the spring and the summer and the absorption rate picks up even more. So I think that to have what we have now happening in one of the weaker quarters of the year from a seasonality perspective and early on in the delivery sort of pressure pipeline I think that it gives us some reason in comfort that by the time we get to the back half of next year the conditions start to change a bit.
Bradley Heffern: Okay. That’s all I have. Thanks.
Operator: We will take our next question from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Connor Mitchell: Thanks for taking my question. So you can just discuss the rising labor cost a little bit and maybe that's especially with third-party vendors. So just thinking about that it'd be fair to presume that your markets are strong economically which would bode well for demand. So thinking about the big picture would it be fair to say that demand and rent growth are healthy enough to offset the rising labor costs?
Eric Bolton: Well I mean the demand is strong, but in terms of revenue growth I mean the problem we're facing is -- or the challenge we're facing is just a lot of supply in the pipeline right now. And that's what's really -- that sort of supply-demand dynamic is not as strong as it had been. And so that's what's really creating this spread if you -- if you will between sort of, rent growth and what we see taking place with growth rate and labor costs. As Clay alludes to we are seeing at least with our own sort of hiring practices that we are starting to see a little moderation begin to show up. And -- and we do think that as we get into -- and as Brad alluded to we're seeing a lot of evidence out there with some of the people we talk to various vendors that -- and architecture and others would work with on the development side that the construction workforce is starting to have a little bit more availability and it's not quite as much in demand. And that to some degree affects our labor costs as it relates to our maintenance operations. So -- we do think as Clay alluded to we do think that we likely are looking at some moderation in labor cost from the growth rate that we're seeing today. We expect some moderation on that as we get into next year.
Connor Mitchell: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe sticking with demand. You've referenced that demand is really the driving force align supply comes and goes. Could you just maybe rank how bike historically how strong demand is in the pace of demand in this year and maybe heading into the year-end compared to previous years in cycles?
Eric Bolton: Well I mean -- Tim you want to add anything to.
Tim Argo: I was just going to make one point that at a high level we've done some research and with some of our third-party data as you go back the last five years or so or really, really the last five or 10 years. The highest supplied markets which tend to have been in the Sunbelt have also been some of the best rate growth markets and that's because of the demand side. So we have historically over the long term demand has more than offset the supply picture. Now we have an elevated supply picture right now that's put that out of the balance at least for a temporary time. But as we get into late next year and over the long term historically has shown and we believe continue to show all the demand fundamentals show that over the long term that demand outpaces the supply.
Eric Bolton: I can't tell you compared to, sort of, the migration numbers that we saw kind of throw the COVID years out which were a bit unusual. But the level of net in migration that we see happening right now is still higher than it was historically higher than it was before COVID. And so these Sunbelt markets continue to offer a lot of things that employers are looking for and so that component of the demand cycle I think is better than it historically has been. I will also tell you that the move out to home buying and tailwind that we are getting on demand is a consequence of that have never been this strong either. And so, there are some unique variables out there right now that continue to support demand at a level that is stronger than what we've seen historically.
Connor Mitchell: Okay. I appreciate the color. And maybe if I could just sneak one more in. Going back to Atlanta. Did you mention that you're recapturing some of the units due to the fraud issues? Or would you be able to provide a time line on when you would recapture those units? Thanks.
Tim Argo: Well, I mean it's an ongoing process. I think what we've seen is that for a period from COVID up until really early this year, the counties in Atlanta specifically have been really slow to act or take any action whatsoever. So, we've seen that start to accelerate. Horton County is still a little bit of an issue, but [indiscernible] have increased their activities. So we see it starting to happen. But -- and I think we've gotten through a lot of it but it will continue over the next few months. And I think as we get into later next year, we're back into more of a normal situation in terms of Atlanta. Like I said, we've done a lot of work to make sure we're not exacerbating the problem by letting any potential fraudulent people coming in the front door.
Connor Mitchell: All right. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from [indiscernible]. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. Good morning. So getting back to the acquisition strategy I think one of the problems over the years is they bought when they should be selling and they've sold when they should be buying. So, what you're saying is interesting. I'm wondering the speed by which this strategy can unfold. You talked about the implied cost of your equity. If you were -- your balance sheet is obviously very attractive, but perhaps inefficiently so at 3.4 times debt that leaves $1.3 billion or so of more debt you could put on just to get to 4.5 times. So maybe that's untouchable now in the rate environment. But I'm just curious you've got the amount to finance this. Could this be some sizable activity at this point? Or do you think it will be more like one-off asset by asset like non needle-moving type of stuff for the time being?
Joe Fracchia: Well we hope it will be needle moving. We're optimistic Rich that there will be certainly more buying opportunity emerging over the coming year. Now having said that, there are a lot of people, with a lot of dry powder right now and I think multifamily real estate is still viewed as an attractive commercial real estate asset class. And everybody understands the need for housing in the country. And I think there's a more healthy appreciation for the Sunbelt markets perhaps than there has been in a number of years. And so we think that while the opportunity to buy and the transaction market gets better, we think that it will also potentially be pretty competitive. We would hope to -- going back to the last recession 2008, 2009, the two years coming out of that downturn. We bought 7,000 apartments over a two-year period of time. I think -- I don't see that getting repeated, but we do think that the opportunity set will be more plentiful for us going over the coming year than it has been certainly for the last four or five years. In this higher rate environment some of the private equity players are not going to be quite as -- be able to be quite as aggressive as they have been. There's more of a sort of an equilibrium in terms of cost of capital between us and the and the private guys given their higher use of debt. And you're right. I mean we've got a lot of capacity on the balance sheet. We're anxious to put it to work, but we're going to remain disciplined about it. But we do think that the opportunities definitely start to pick up and we're hopeful it will be significant.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. And then second question maybe to Tim or others, but on the October spread between new and renewal, pendulum on these sort of growth numbers always swings too wide. I don't think anyone expected 20%-plus type of rent growth a year ago and maybe this is surprising to the downside. When you think about the first half of 2024, should we be conditioning all of us investors and analysts for negative blended number at least for the first half of the year when you think about that pendulum factor or is zero your kind of number from this point forward you're not giving guidance but is there a range of sort of surprise factor that could bring that into negative territory at least for a period of time next year?
Tim Argo: Zero is what we have dialed in for Q4 in terms of our forecast which as we said is kind of where we sit right now for October and Q1 typically compared to Q4 if I'm thinking about sort of normal environment or historical environment is usually pretty similar. I do think -- I think you could see those numbers move a little bit on the margins up or down in terms of blended that's going slightly negative or slightly positive. I do say as we get -- as I mentioned earlier as we get into the spring I think you start to see some normal seasonality in terms of new lease rates. We're not going to jump up to positive three or four all of a sudden I do think you'll see some acceleration. So there'll be some bands, but I don't think it's widely different than what you talked about because we do think renewals remain pretty consistent and with where we see turnover going that will blend in as a little bit bigger factor in terms of the overall blended rate as compared to new leases.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, good enough. And congrats to Al, good luck to you.
Al Campbell: Thanks Rich. I appreciate it man.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Anthony Powell: Hi, good morning. Quick question on the transaction environment, I think you mentioned that you saw cap rates increase by 15 basis points in the third quarter. Given where interest rates have not given where public market, stocks, I would expect that to maybe expand a bit more. So where do you think cap rates go the next few quarters that you seek to deploy more capital here? 
Brad Hill: Hi, Anthony, this is Brad. I mean, I think a couple of things. One, keep in mind that what we saw in the third quarter was very limited in terms of transactions. Certainly we -- as I mentioned in my comments we saw activity -- marketing activity pick up a bit early in the third quarter, but a lot of that has not closed at this point really just a handful of projects closed and we saw those cap rates come up a little bit. But to Eric's point earlier about the availability of capital for well-located properties in good markets, we continue to see strong bedsheets for those. And so and we're still seeing cap rates in the low 5% range for those well-located assets. I would expect to see pressure on cap rates. But really it's going to depend on how that liquidity shows up for those assets to bid on them. But certainly given the severe movement that we've seen in the 10-year. And agency debt today is in the 6.5%, 6.75% range, we would expect some upward movement in cap rates but to what degree is going to depend on the liquidity picture, the fundamentals of the properties locations things of that nature. So it's really hard to say where that goes from here.
Anthony Powell: Got it. Thanks. And maybe on turnover and renewal rent growth. How aware are tenants typically of a highly growth environment like this? And are you seeing tenants come to you and ask for rent declines, seeing tenants move out to newer buildings? And is that a risk next year as more of these apartments are delivered in your market? 
Tim Argo: Well, I think certainly they're aware. I mean the transparency now with what's on websites and social media and everything else and all the different marketing avenues and advertising platforms that certainly they're aware and you can see down to a unit level a lot of times on websites. But probably tell a new phenomenon. It's been that way now at least for the last couple of years. So I think there's a component of the renewal side of just you've hopefully provide them with good resident service. They're happy where they're living. They're happy with the manager and their owner. And there are some friction costs involved as well. It’s pain to move, it’s expensive to move. So there are some things from a customer service and a friction cost standpoint that are meaningful. But overall as we talked about I'll see turnover changing much from where it is now. So I don't think that becomes any more of an outsized pressure than it has been.
Anthony Powell: Good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is open.
Wes Golladay: Hey, good morning everyone. I have a question on the capital allocation front. I mean, is there a point where you buyback to maybe become a top priority when you consider were development yield are penciling-in and acquisition yields. And then they seem pretty thin where the 10-year trading and typically acquisition cap rates have been north of 100, 200 basis points over the 10-year. So it seems that gives them the upward pressure in the private market.
Brad Hill: Well, again as we touched on a little earlier I mean, we think that the opportunity to put capital work as we did with the Phoenix acquisition is the appropriate and best value creation from a long-term perspective, particularly given where the initial yield is and the opportunity we have we think over the next couple of years to really improve that yield meaningfully. So we continue to believe that remaining patient with the balance sheet capacity we have and looking for what we are expecting to be even more compelling opportunities as we move forward with some of the distress in the market from some of these merchant builders that the longer-term value creation associated with some of these acquisitions is going to make a lot more sense. As Brad mentioned, we do have -- of opportunity teeing up on the development front but we control the timing on that. And we do think that we're going to see some moderation begin to take place with the construction cost and we think the yields there are going to get better. So we -- and as I say we've got the luxury of making controlling the timing of when we elect to pull the trigger on those projects. And of course, these projects if we were to start anything next year, I mean, it's going to deliver in '26 and '27 and it's going to be we think healthier leasing environment at that point. So we're going to be patient but we think that some of the external growth opportunities that we have in front of us over the coming couple of years is the best sort of value creation opportunity that we have in terms of how to put this balance sheet capacity to work.
Wes Golladay: And a follow-up to that are you seeing any portfolios or maybe somewhat aggregated assets and maybe debt was underwritten at a very low cap rate environment or maybe a lot of floating rate debt. Is there anything kind of penciled in to fit your quality criteria? . 
Eric Bolton: Well we pay attention to those opportunities when they come out. More often than not what we have found is the asset quality is not really what we want to do and not of interest to us. And a lot of the aggressive buying and high leverage buying that took place over the last few years. A lot of it was associated with sort of a lower price point product to our current portfolio and just -- we haven't found it to be particularly compelling to add to our balance sheet.
Wes Golladay: Great. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats.
Eric Bolton: Thank you, Wes. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Linda Tsai: Just one really quick one. Can you remind us of what's causing higher fraud in certain markets? Is it demographic shift technology? And then what are mitigation strategies. 
Tim Argo: I mean, it's difficult to say. I think what we have seen is certainly since COVID and post-COVID that the actions taken by the courts and the judges and that sort of thing has become a little bit more lax so that frankly creates a little bit more opportunity for bad actors. What we've done in turn is -- we've familiarized ourselves and have some experts so to speak within our team that are good at identifying that sort of thing. And frankly, what happens is if you get -- you start to get a reputation, if you will that these guys are good at catching it and the people trying to the front door that way tend to stay away. So it starts to solve itself from some standpoint, if you can be good at detecting it and good at defending it preventing it.
Eric Bolton: And Linda I'd add a couple of things to that. I do think that new technology that's available to people today has probably fostered some opportunity and techniques and certain capabilities in this area that are different certainly than where they were years ago and probably a little bit harder to detect. And we've made some modifications in our approval processes and how we screen that is now much more effective at that. And the other thing, I would just comment on that you alluded to is -- it's important to recognize that where we have seen this has really been pretty isolated. We've called out Atlanta and frankly just a few properties in the Atlanta market where we saw this in a pickup in a noticeable way. I wouldn't suggest that this is a pervasive practice that we see happening across the portfolio in a lot of different markets. It was really more of an isolated scenario. It happens to be Atlanta where we have a lot. But -- and as Tim mentioned we see the trends changing there as a consequence and improving as a consequence of some of the changes that we've made in our approval processes.
Linda Tsai: Got it. Thanks for the color.
Operator: We have no further questions. I will turn the call over to MAA for closing remarks.
Andrew Schaeffer: We appreciate everyone joining us this morning and I'm sure we'll see most of you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks. So thank you.
Operator: That conclude today's program for participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MAA Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, July 27, 2023. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.
Andrew Schaeffer : Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our '34 Act filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton : Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Leasing conditions across the MAA portfolio continued to reflect our steady employment markets, strong positive migration trends and continued low resident turnover. As a result, we are seeing good demand for apartment housing and are absorbing the new supply deliveries while supporting solid rent growth. In line with normal seasonal patterns, new lease pricing improved in the second quarter and the spread between new lease pricing and renewal pricing narrowed.  Rents for new move-in residents jumped 100 basis points higher on a sequential basis as compared to the preceding first quarter. Renewal lease pricing in the second quarter remained strong, growing by 6.8%, driving overall blended pricing performance in Q2 to 3.8%, which is ahead of the original projections we had for the year. Occupancy remains steady with average physical occupancy in the second quarter at 95.5%, which is consistent with the preceding first quarter this despite a higher number of lease expirations during the second quarter. While we are working through a higher level of new supply deliveries across our markets for the next few quarters, with the demand trends holding up as they are, we expect to continue to drive top line results that will exceed our long-term historical averages as has been the case in prior cycles of higher supply, we see the demand supply dynamic holding up slightly better in our mid-tier markets and this component of our strategy continues to bring support to overall portfolio performance during this part of the cycle. As described in our first quarter report, we do expect to see moderation in year-over-year growth in operating expenses as inflation pressures ease a bit and some of the efficiencies we expect to capture from new tech initiatives increasingly make an impact. As Al will cover in his comments, we do now also expect to see some relief on property taxes coming out of Texas, which further supports our ability to reduce our outlook for expense growth over the back half of the year. The transaction market remains quiet. We continue to underwrite a few deals, but the limited number of properties coming to market, combined with strong investor interest continues to support low cap rates and strong pricing. We continue to expect that more compelling opportunities will emerge later this year and into 2024 and believe it's important to remain patient with our balance sheet capacity.  Our new lease-up, new development and redevelopment pipelines will all continue to make solid progress and will provide attractive incremental additional earnings over the next few years. I did want to take a moment and express my deep appreciation to our on-site property teams for all their hard work and great service to our residents during these busy summer months. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brad.
Brad Hill : Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As we've seen each quarter over the past year or so, second quarter transaction activity remains muted versus normal levels. Volatility and uncertainty in the debt market continued to cause the majority of sellers to postpone their sales processes, leading to a drop of more sale inventory on the market. For high-quality, well-located properties in our region of the country, there continues to be strong investor demand, causing cap rates to adjust slower than interest rate movements alone would indicate. Having said that, we have seen an average buyer cap rates move up to 4.9% in the second quarter from 4.7% in the first quarter, with most cap rates ranging between 4.75% and 5.25%. We continue to believe we're likely to see more compelling acquisition opportunities later this year and into next. So we remain patient as we wait for the market to continue to adjust. We are actively reviewing a number of acquisition opportunities, but with no potential acquisitions under contract at the moment. We've lowered our acquisition forecast for the year to $200 million at the midpoint. Our acquisition team remains active in the market and now and the team have our balance sheet in great shape and ready to quickly support any transaction opportunity should it materialize. Due to the lower funds needed for expected acquisitions, we've also lowered our disposition forecast for the year to $100 million at the midpoint. Our properties in their initial lease up continue to outperform our original expectations, producing higher NOIs and higher earnings and creating additional long-term value for the company. These properties are navigating the increased supply pressure well and on average, have captured in-place rents 22% above our original expectations. For the 4 properties that are either leasing or we'll start leasing in the third quarter, this retinol performance, which is partially offset by higher taxes and insurance is estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 7.2%, which is significantly higher than our original expectations for these properties. Early leasing is going well at Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta, and we expect to start leasing at Novel Val Vista in Phoenix in the third quarter. During the second quarter, we also reached stabilization at MAA LoSo in Charlotte. Despite permitting and approval processes that are taking a bit longer than we anticipated, predevelopment work continues to progress on a number of projects. we expect 3 projects will be ready to start construction in the back half of 2023, if we see sufficient adjustments to construction costs and rents to support our NOI yield expectations. These projects include 2 in-house developments, 1 in Orlando and 1 in Denver and 1 prepurchased joint venture development in Charlotte. We've pushed back the start of the Phase 2 to our West Midtown prepurchased development in Atlanta to the 2024 due to the approval process taking longer than anticipated. The team continues to work through the increased prepurchase development opportunities that have been presented to us, and we're hopeful we will be able to add additional currently unidentified development opportunities to our pipeline. Any project we start over the next 12 to 18 months would likely deliver in 2026 or 2027, and should be well positioned to capitalize on what we believe is likely to be a much stronger leasing environment, reflecting the significant slowdown in new starts expected over the balance of 2023 and 2024.  Our construction management team remains focused on completing and delivering our 6 under-construction projects, and we're doing a tremendous managing these projects and working with our contractors to minimize the impact of inflationary and supply chain pressures as well as labor constraints on our development costs and schedules. During the quarter, the team successfully completed and accepted delivery of the combined 249 units and Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.
Tim Argo : Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Same-store revenue growth for the quarter was essentially in line with our expectations with stable occupancy low resident turnover and better blended rent performance than what we previously projected. Despite increasing supply pressure in some of our markets, blended lease-over-lease pricing of 3.8% comprised of new lease growth of 0.5% and renewal growth of 6.8% was better than our forecasted expectations. While occupancy was slightly below our expected range for the quarter, the resulting higher blended lease growth performance is a favorable trade-off providing a greater future compounding growth effect. As discussed last quarter, we expected new lease pricing to show a typical seasonality that is to accelerate from the first quarter and renewal pricing, which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022 to moderate some, but still provide the catalyst to strong second quarter pricing performance. As Eric mentioned, this played out as expected with new lease pricing accelerating 100 basis points as compared to the first quarter and renewal pricing remaining strong. Alongside the pricing performance, average daily occupancy remained consistent with the first quarter at 95.5%, contributing to overall same-store revenue growth of 8.1%. The various demand factors we monitor remained strong in the second quarter with 60-day exposure, which represents all current vacant units plus those units would notice to vacate over the next 60 days, largely consistent with prior year at 8.5% versus 8.4% in the second quarter of last year. Furthermore, Quarterly resident turnover was down almost 2% from the prior year. Move-ins from markets outside of our footprint ticked up slightly from Q1 to 13% and rent to income ticked down slightly from Q1 to 22%. The employment market remains relatively strong also, particularly in the Sunbelt markets. While lead volume trailed the record demand scenarios we saw in 2021 and 2022, it is up from 2018 and 2019. And last years where we experienced a more normal demand curve.  Our prospect engagement platform that combines AI, marketing automation and scheduled human engagement has enabled us to engage with prospects more effectively. July to date, pricing remains ahead of our original expectations with blended pricing of 3.2%. This is comprised of new lease pricing of 0.3% and renewal pricing of 5.5%. The new lease pricing is relatively consistent with the 0.5% for the second quarter and within 5 basis points of June new lease pricing. As expected, renewal pricing is moderating to a more normal range as leases are beginning to expire that were signed in the period last year when renewal rents had caught up to new lease rents. Physical occupancy is currently 95.6% with average daily occupancy for July month to date of 95.3%. The current July occupancy and July exposure, which is even with the prior year, 7.5%, puts us in a good position for the remainder of the quarter. A key part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets, submarkets, asset types and price points.  As we compete with elevated supply deliveries, particularly in some of our larger markets, many of our mid-tier markets are performing well and leading the portfolio and pricing performance, both in the second quarter and into July. Savannah, Charleston, Richmond, Kansas City, Greenville and Raleigh are all outperforming the overall portfolio. We expect that this market diversification, combined with continued strong demand fundamentals will help mitigate the impact of new supply that we expect to be elevated over the next several quarters. Regarding redevelopment, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives in the second quarter. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of Smart Home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the second quarter of 2023, we completed nearly 1,900 interior unit upgrades and installed nearly 2,300 Smart Home packages.  We are nearing completion on the Smart Home initiative and now have over 92,000 units with this technology and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023. For our repositioning program, leases have been fully or partially repriced at the first 15 properties in the program and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on cost in the upper teens. We have another 5 projects that will begin repricing in the third quarter and are evaluating an additional group of properties to potentially begin construction later in 2023. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. Now I'll turn the call over to Al.
Al Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO for the quarter, $2.28 per share was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. The outperformance was primarily driven by favorable interest in overhead costs during the quarter, and a large portion of the overhead cost favorability is timing related with the cost now expected to be incurred in the back half of the year. Overall, same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. As Tim mentioned, blended lease pricing continues to outperform original expectations for the year and build stronger-than-expected longer-term revenue but was primarily offset in the second quarter by average occupancy slightly below forecast. Also, as expected, we began to see moderation in same-store operating expense growth during the second quarter with the growth of personnel, repair and maintenance and real estate expenses, tax expenses, excuse me, which combined represents 70% of total operating costs, all reflecting moderation from the prior quarter. We expect moderation for these items to continue through the remainder of the year, particularly for real estate taxes, which we'll discuss more with guidance in just a moment.  As mentioned in the release, our annual property and casualty insurance programs renewed on July 1, and with combined premium increase of approximately 20%, which is in line with our prior guidance. During the quarter, we invested a total of $26.3 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart reinstallation programs producing strong returns and adding to the quality of our portfolio.  We also funded just over $51 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $735 million pipeline, leaving $344 million remaining to be funded. As Brad mentioned, we also expect to start several new deals over the next 12 to 18 months, likely expanding our development pipeline to be closer to $1 billion, which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant safety and future opportunity. Our leverage remains historically low, the debt-to-EBITDA at 3.4x, and our debt is currently 100% fixed for an average of 7.5 years at a record low 3.4%. We do have $350 million of debt maturing in the fourth quarter but our current plan is to remain patient and allow interest rates and financing markets to continue stabilizing over the next few quarters before refinancing with long-term debt.  And finally, given the second quarter's earnings performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are revising our core FFO and several other areas of our guidance previously provided. With the blended pricing outperformance achieved through the second quarter, we are increasing the midpoint of our effective rent growth guidance to 7.4%, a 25 basis points increase. This is offset by a decrease in our physical occupancy guidance, which is now projected to average 95.5% for the full year, a 30 basis points decrease. Though this trade-off support slightly higher rental earning going forward, our total revenue growth guidance for this year remains unchanged at the midpoint of 6.25%.  In early July, the Texas state legislature passed the tax overhaul which significantly rolled back property tax rates across the state to effectively redistribute a budget surplus. Given aggressive property valuations, we had previously anticipated rate rollbacks in Texas, where we have now added a specific reduction for this legislation, which lowers our overall same-store real estate tax growth rate for the year by 50 basis points to 5.5% at the midpoint and that's $0.02 per share to core FFO for the year. There's still limited information regarding exactly how individual counties and municipalities will push this change through but our guidance now includes our early estimate of this overall impact, which is expected to be ongoing. In summary, we are increasing our core FFO projections for the full year to a midpoint of $9.14 per share, which is an increase of $0.03 per share. This increase is primarily comprised of a carry-through of $0.01 per share from the second quarter performance -- outperformance as well as the $0.02 per share addition related to the Texas legislation. As Brad mentioned, we also revised our transaction volume expectations for the current year to reflect current market conditions. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Aaron, we will now turn the call back to you for any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Eric Wolfe with Citi.
Eric Wolfe: Apologies if I missed this in your remarks, but could you just tell us the blended rent growth you're expecting sort of for the full year now, that's been revised upward and then what that would be in the back half of the year as well?
Al Campbell: Yes, Eric, this is Al. We had started the year, if you remember, with 3% for the full year, but the outperformance we've seen through the first half, that's increased that. So I think for the full year, we didn't put that in our guidance. But if you do the math on it, it's about 3.5% for this year. And that means largely sticking to the 3% for most of the back half, though we started in July, as Tim talked about stronger than that. So you're probably averaging 3.1%, 3.2% for the back half and that projection now.
Eric Wolfe: Got it. Makes sense. And then you mentioned that new lease rates did come up as you expected in the second quarter, as you would expect, seasonally but there's still a pretty wide gap between new lease and renewal rate growth. So I was just trying to understand what your sort of expectation would be for new lease growth in the back half of the year? And then thinking through whether that's actually a good sort of proxy for market rent growth should the 2 kind of be around the same?
Tim Argo: Eric, this is Tim. With new lease growth, we did, as you said, we saw it accelerate some as we expected. It didn't accelerate quite as much as what we would see in a normal environment. I do think there's a little bit of supply pressure impact on that. Having said that, I don't really expect it to decelerate as much as it normally might would in Q3. It's typically kind of around this time that you start seeing new lease pricing moderate a little bit as demand starts to moderate some. So I don't expect the volatility, if you will, to be quite as large on the new lease side. On the renewal side, we talked about it from the beginning of the year, there was a sort of unusual scenario last year where for the first, call it, 7, 8 months of 2022, new lease pricing outpaced renewal pricing quite a bit. So we knew we had some opportunity kind of mark-to-market those that were on the renewal rates as the first part of last year. So we've kind of reached a point where we're lapping those and starting to reprice those. That's where you've seen the renewal pricing moderate a little bit, but we still expect it to be quite a bit stronger than new lease rates, which is typical and really just kind of returning to a normal seasonality scenario.
Operator: And we will go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.
Jamie Feldman : Great. I appreciate your comments on mid-tier markets outperforming the entire portfolio. Can you talk more about A versus B and how those are performing within your market?
Tim Argo: Yes. This is Tim. It's -- the Bs are still outperforming a little bit. I would call it kind of a 40 to 50 basis point gap between what -- how we would define As versus Bs, and that's pretty consistent on the new lease side and the renewal side. So I think it's as part of the portfolio structure that we expect those markets that can be more of the B assets perform well and some of the supply or in most markets, the supply coming in, hasn't been quite as impactful on some of the more B assets. They've typically been much higher price, more urban-style assets and at a much higher rent than particularly some of the B assets.
Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then in the press release, you talked about demand kind of maybe even better than your initial expectations and mitigating some of the supply risks. Can you give more color or maybe put some numbers around that? Maybe I don't know if you've looked in that detail, but like what percentage of job growth, do you need to mitigate that supply risk? Just more color on what gives you confidence in making that statement and what you're seeing.
Tim Argo: Yes. So there's a few things that we typically look at as a leading indicator of demand. You obviously have job growth at a macro level, which continues to be pretty strong and certainly stronger in a lot of the Sunbelt markets and then more granularly, we look at exposure, lead volume, what we call lead per exposed unit, which is really a combination of those 2 metrics and then also looking at what our renewal accept rates are. So on lead volume and leads for exposed, it's not at the level it was in '22, which was record demand. But as I noted in the comments, you go back to kind of the 2018, 2019 time frame when we saw more normal, if you will, demand scenario, we have -- our lead volume leads per exposed is quite a bit higher than those times. So that's encouraging that our renewal accept rates remained strong and higher to that period as well. We have 60% accept rate for July, 58% for August and 43% for September, which is at or above where we would expect or we would like to see it. And then a couple of other metrics, rent-to-income continues to stay consistent, stay lower, actually dropped a little bit from what it was in Q1, turnover remains low and reasons people moving out to buy house is way down. So all of those various factors, while not quite at the level we've seen with the record performance last year, still healthy and stronger than typical year, if you will.
Eric Bolton: And Jamie, this is Eric. I'll add to what Tim just said, which covers a lot of reasons why we see the demand staying healthy. The other thing it's just a continued positive migration trends, 13% of the leases that we wrote in Q2 were for people moving into the Sunbelt for the first time. And that compares to 15%, 16% during the peak of COVID. So while it's moderated, it's moderated just a little bit, and it's still well above where it was before COVID had started. So these positive migration trends are still there. Any thought of some kind of reversal after COVID was over. I think we've dispelled that fear at this point. So there's just a multitude of factors that sort of go into it, and we're pleased with where we see demand continuing to hold up.
Jamie Feldman : Okay. That's very helpful color. And then finally for me, your comments about expenses moderating into the back half of the year, certainly encouraging. As you think about '24 and the key line items, do you have a sense like do you think all of them will be down in terms of your expense growth rate?
Al Campbell: I think as you talk about, I mean, too early to really get to a refinement '24, but certainly, we would expect some continued moderation, just some of the inflationary pressures begin to weighing. The 3 main areas, obviously, the personal repair, maintenance and taxes. Taxes, I would say, being the biggest, certainly it's going to follow the moderations of the top line. So it's a backward-looking thing. So you would naturally think that as '24 looking back to '23, which is a good year, but a more moderate year than it was in '22 that you should see some moderation there. So probably in those 3 that make up 70% of our expenses, you'll see some moderation at some level.
Jamie Feldman : Any ballpark?
Al Campbell: Hard to ballpark at this point. I don't think it would be probably a long-term rate, but somewhere between we are today and that.
Operator: And we will move then to Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Austin Wurschmidt : I'm just curious if you're finding that you're having to trade off some of that new growth to drive traffic or sustain occupancy in the 95.5% level. It seemed like July occupancy dipped from we were tracking. And I'm just ongoing kind of think through as sort of seasonal demands lows and supply picks up, does that concern as you move to the latter part of the year and heading into '24?
Tim Argo: Also, this is Tim. On the occupancy front, we've kind of -- we've been hanging in that 95.5% range for really all of the first half of the year, which we've been comfortable with, as we mentioned, with pricing being a little bit better than we thought. So we're willing to make that trade-off with the compounding growth we can get from rents. As we moved into July, I can see it moderated a little bit. There is some unique circumstances in Atlanta that we can talk about that's driving that down a little bit, if you kind of pull Atlanta out of that number, we'd be right back to 95.5% on occupancy, which we're comfortable being in that range. So it hasn't it hasn't moved the needle. I don't think I'm a new lease rate a little bit. I mean there is some supply pressure that we've talked about. But outside of that, I don't think there's anything specifically tied to occupancy necessarily.
Eric Bolton: And Austin, I'll also add a couple of points on that. The thing to keep in mind is we have a pretty extensive sort of redevelopment and some of the new technology initiatives that we're particularly smart home initiative, that continues to fuel the opportunity for positioning the portfolio at a higher rent level, particularly as it compares to some of the new supply coming into the market. One of the benefits of the supply coming to the market, particularly when it's coming into the market on average 20% higher than the rents that we're charging, it creates a more compelling value play for our portfolio to the rental market.  And so that's working to give us some momentum on the rent growth that we might otherwise not have both of those things. And then -- the -- so I would just tell you -- and the other thing that I would tell you is we track pretty actively why people leave us. And when you look at move-outs that are occurring because people don't want to pay the rent increase, has ticked down a little bit from where it was last year as a percent of our turnover, but it's still running higher than it has long term. And as Tim says, we're okay with that trade-off for a slightly lower proxy right now because that revenue growth associated with rents is really much more impactful in terms of compounding value over the long term. So we sort of like where we are right now and continue with this sort of trying to manage that tension between pricing and occupancy where it is right now.
Austin Wurschmidt : Got it. No, that's helpful. It sounds like that occupancy and maybe even some of the frictional vacancy is like redevelopment was picking up a little bit from where you had originally expected. Second question, when you look across some of your larger markets, obviously, new lease growth is modestly positive. But when you kind of look across the large markets where you're feeling some of the supply pressure more acutely, are there any that are notable gain to lease today that you'd kind of highlight that we should be a little bit more focused on moving forward?
Tim Argo: Austin, it's Tim. When you say Gain to lease, meaning where there's …
Austin Wurschmidt : A couple of months are noticeably above market rents. Yes.
Tim Argo: Not -- I wouldn't say anything significant. Even -- we do have some negative new lease rates on a couple of those larger markets, but none of them are getting to out about, I mean they're kind of in that negative 1%, 5% range. So it's not a huge, huge variance in what we're seeing overall. So nothing significant that I would point out.
Austin Wurschmidt : Or those that are at that kind of negative 1%-ish range?
Tim Argo: So you've got -- I would point out Austin is, 1 that's been a little softer also in Phoenix, and we've talked about those 2 markets here for a while are kind of the 2 that I would point out that have been our weaker performers and certainly have some supply impact. It's great about the long term, obviously, we have great demand fundamentals, but those have been 2 that probably lead the list in terms of our higher concentration markets.
Operator: We will go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern : For some of the markets that are lagging their normal seasonal trends, like you obviously just mentioned Austin and Phoenix but some of the other ones as well. Do you think that that's entirely due to elevated supply? Or are there any other factors that you would call out that might be driving that?
Tim Argo: No, I don't think it's primarily supply. I mean, supply is somewhat widespread across several of the larger markets in particular. And then it's nuanced to by market, obviously, and depending on where our portfolio is relative to some others. I mean, Charlotte is a good example. It's getting high level of supply, similar to some of these other markets, but it's performed well, and it's just kind of where our portfolio is positioned versus where the supply is coming in. So generally, I'd say supply, again, going back to the demand side. If you look at job growth across our markets compared to national averages, we're pretty consistently higher than average across all those markets. So there's obviously nuances by market but nothing notable outside of that.
Brad Heffern : Okay. Got it. And then on the balance sheet, obviously, you've been setting record low leverage numbers every quarter for a while now. What do you think the likelihood is that we'll see these sub-4x numbers stick around for the long term? Or I guess, what are the circumstances where you would potentially take leverage back up to a more normal level?
Al Campbell: So Brad, this is Al. And we've talked about for, I think, several quarters now. Certainly, we love the strength of our balance sheet, but our leverage is really below where we want long term at this point. We've been patient to allow opportunities come to us. So in our credit rating at A minus, 4.5 would be something you could be very confident so we're a full turn below that right now. So significant opportunity there, but willing to be patient to allow Brad to find the right investments.
Eric Bolton: And we do think that as we get later in this year and particularly into 2024, that we are seeing early indications that would suggest that opportunities are going to start to pick up. As Brad alluded to, we have seen cap rates moved just a tad on a sequential basis quarter-to-quarter. And we're talking -- he and his team are talking to another -- a number of merchant builders right now about some opportunities. So we continue to feel confident and comfortable that more opportunity is around the corner.
Operator: And we will move next to Michael Goldsmith with UBS.
Michael Goldsmith: In response to an earlier question in the Q&A, you talked about new lease not accelerating as much as you expected. Does that mean that new leases have the rent growth has peaked earlier in the season than it had in the past? And then the second part of that question talked about you don't expect it to decelerate as quickly, why is that?
Tim Argo: Well, one nuance there. The new lease pricing has done what we expected. It didn't decelerate or it didn't accelerate less than we expected. It accelerated a little bit less than what we've seen in the last couple of years, but in line with, if not slightly better than expectations. And so what we've seen is new lease pricing accelerate, just not quite as much as it may do in a lower supplied environment. So I think at the same time, given all the fundamentals we're seeing and the various metrics we talked about earlier, don't quite expect that new lease rate to drop off quite as much as it might normally for kind of the same reason been accelerated as much. So that's kind of how we see it playing out. But really have been as if not better than expected.
Michael Goldsmith: And then as a follow-up, there's a lot of new supply coming in your markets, tenants or potential tenants have a lot of options to choose from. Are you seeing a longer time for tenants to make a decision? Or maybe like between your traffic to visit and the time between that and when they sign our conversion rates being low. What are you seeing in the trends there? What are you seeing in the trends from that perspective?
Tim Argo: Not really anything, Michael. It's probably taken a little bit longer for us to get an answer on the renewal side, but ultimately, as I mentioned, our renewal accept rates are better than they were a couple of years ago in a similar environment and kind of where we expect to see them. Our conversion rates are in line with period as well. So nothing notable other than -- I mentioned the leads are down a little bit from what we saw last year, but we would have expected that with the growth we saw last year.
Operator: And we will go next to Alex Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
Alex Goldfarb : So just trying to put a bow on the supply. It's obviously been a big topic. If I hear correctly from what you're saying, it sounds like it's really only Phoenix and Austin where it's really an issue. Atlanta has maybe as another market, just given the occupancy dip that you talked about. But otherwise, the balance of your portfolio, it sounds like yes, there's supply, but it's not really competitive with you guys. You feel comfortable with the in-migration, the economic growth, the job growth to be comfortable with your rents. So is that sort of the main takeaway that the supply is really limited to maybe 2 or 3 markets for you guys, and that's it. All the other markets are fine. I just sort of want to encapsulate this.
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean also an advantage of the 2 that are the worst. I mean I wouldn't say we only have 2 or 3 that are feeling any supply impacts. I mean I think it is impacting several of our markets at some level. But what we've always talked about is with the demand being there, supply just sort of moderate things. It doesn't put a ditch. It says shocks on the demand side that really send rate growth negative for extended period of time, and we're not seeing that. So I mean I -- like I said, I wouldn't say there's only 2 we're feeling some supply pressure, but those are the most notable. But otherwise, demand is doing a pretty good job of mitigating things.
Alex Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is your guidance for the second quarter is rather wide. And I'm assuming you guys are pretty conservative route, but [$2.18] on the low side, just low, obviously. So should we expect a decline quarter-to-quarter? Or are there some oddball things that could come up that would drive like I'm just trying to think why would FFO go down? And maybe you'll say, hey, it's a onetime item. There's some sort of tax impact or returns or something like that, that we're going to see.
Al Campbell: Alex, this is Al. I think, you see in the second and third quarter often, some things that are below same-store NOI, whether it be overhead, whether it be -- so just some items that are more -- that are not in your operating costs. And so second and third quarter, they tend to be chunky. What we're seeing is some of those costs we talked about that we outperformed in the second quarter on G&A. But that would be timing lag. Some of that's going to come back to us seeing some of that in the third quarter, which expects that a little bit. So nothing unusual. You see that second and third quarter be a little volatile, but the important point is just the projection for the year, continued strength.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.
Nick Yulico : Tim, just going back to Atlanta. I know last quarter, you talked about some weather issues affecting occupancy. Was there anything else driving the occupancy being lower there this quarter?
Tim Argo: Yes. A couple of things going there. I mean Atlanta is experiencing a decent amount of supply. It's not quite as high as some of our other markets, but relative to what Atlanta typically gets there. There is some supply pressure. But a couple of other things impacting that. You mentioned one of them. We had sort of late first quarter, early second quarter over the course of 2 or 3 months. We had about 100 units come back online in Atlanta, which was a mixture of some units that were down to storm damage and then a fire at one of our properties. And so pulling those back into the portfolio and meaning to lease those up had some impacts. And then secondly, which is hinders us a little bit in the short term, but is positive on the long term is Atlanta and the counties there have started to progress some on evictions and filings and doing court dates and kind of working through that whole process, which has been a real laggard in terms of our markets for working through that. So we actually year-to-date have seen about 140 more [Indiscernible] and skips this time versus the same period last year. So a good thing, as I said, long term, and we are seeing a little bit better payment progress there, but it kind of doubled down on some of the occupancy pressure there. Revenue and pricing has held in okay. It's a little bit below the market, but not are a little bit below the portfolio but not too bad. And overall, we obviously still feel good about it long term, but just running through a little bit of pressure right now.
Nick Yulico : Okay. And then in terms of -- if we think about new supply and concessions being offered across markets. Can you just give a feel for where concessions are more prevalent, competing product and where you're also offering concessions in the existing assets or in any of the development assets?
Tim Argo: Yes. So for our portfolio, concessions are running about -- cash concessions are about 0.5% of rents. It's ticked up a little bit, but not significantly. I mean we do tend to net price with our pricing systems who don't use a ton of concessions. But broadly, at a market level and what we're seeing some of the competitors. I would say you're at a month free is about where we're at in several of the larger markets. And for most, that is more kind of in-town central areas of the markets, you might see a little bit more if there's a lease up in the area, but we're not seeing any more than a month and a half or so in any of our markets. Austin is one where it's a little unique in that we're actually not seeing a lot of concessions kind of in the Central Austin but more in the suburbs where there's quite a bit of supply. That's one where concessions are a little more prevalent in the suburbs versus other markets where it's more urban and fill.
Brad Hill: Sorry, I just want to add to that real quick. You asked about our lease-up properties. To Tim's point, we've got 1 in lease-up in Austin. That one, we're offering up to a month free, which is on select units, by the way, not across the board. We've got a couple of hundred units competing supply just in that same submarket. So I'd say that one is probably feeling the most pressure. But I will say that average rents on that property are a couple $300 to $400 higher than what we expected. And then the average concession usage there is significantly below what we expected. Most of our new lease-ups, we expect about a month free, and we've been significantly [indiscernible] that on this asset. And then I would just say, all of our properties that are in lease-up right now, we're below what we generally pro forma, which is a month free, just we're offering that on select units as needed. So it's not broad-based use of concessions that we're seeing right now.
Nick Yulico : Great. If I could just follow up on the investment activity and being more patient there. I know you gave some commentary on this. But is that more of a view that, hey, cap rates seem like they're too low to where you're penciling they should make sense? Or is it also just a view that, hey, at some point, we're not sure exactly where market rents are going in some areas, there is supply coming. Maybe there's an opportunity to wait. You mentioned talking to merchant developers and just trying to kind of tie together, I guess, valuation versus a view on, hey, fundamentals are becoming a little bit uncertain because of supply.
Brad Hill: Right. Nick, this is Brad. I would say it's really the belief that we think cap rates will tick up a bit from where they are right now. I mean the fundamentals generally are holding up pretty well within our region of the country, and we're not seeing distress certainly in our region and especially in these lease-up properties. We've seen cap rates tick up over the last year, 1.5 years and really what we believe right now with the limited amount of inventory that's on the market, the capital that's out there kind of piling up on each other on the assets that are coming to market. So that is driving down cap rates. We also continue to see a high proportion of the deals that do trade or 10.31 exchange as well as loan assumptions.  So we just believe that as the elevated supply that's occurred in our market over the last year, 2 years, begins to come to market. Those assets need to trade, merchant developers need to sell and as that product comes to market, it's likely to spread out the capital a bit and we're likely to see cap rates continue to move up a bit from where they are today. Today, interest rates are 5.5%, 5.75%. And I think when you layer on to that, just still good operating fundamentals, but not the 5%, 6%, 7% rent growth that we've seen over the last year.  I do think that, that continues to point to a scenario where the negative leverage continues to decrease, which supports increasing cap rates. So just for context, after the GFC, 3-year period after that, we purchased 9,000 units over a 3-year period. And I don't know if this situation will be as fruitful as that was for us, but it certainly feels like our region is really primarily driven by merchant developers and product needs to trade at some point, and we're starting to see cap rates move up a bit. So we're going to be patient and hold our capacity to what we think will be a better opportunity.
Operator: And we will move next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim : I wanted to ask about your same-store revenue guidance. You narrowed the range, but you maintained the midpoint. But you started the year with 5.5% earn-in. So just to hit the top end of your same-store revenue guidance of 7%. You only really needed to achieve 3% lease growth rates for the year. You've already exceeded that. I think you've been saying that lease growth rates have come in higher than expected. So I know that occupancy offsets this a little bit, same with the fees, but your 6.25% midpoint seems very conservative today. I just wanted your response on this.
Al Campbell: John, this is Al. I think the important point there, we didn't cover today, we've talked about it a bit in the past is that there is a little bit of dilution in that total revenue from the pricing line because there's other income components that are about 10% of our revenue stream that aren't growing, if they call it 7%. And so they're going 2% to 3%. And so that dilutes it some. So that's probably the difference there. But in general, the math that you laid out was the 5.5% carry in plus half of the pricing performance we've gotten this year, which is we've talked about was 3% -- 3.5% blended pricing, half of that. That gives you pretty close to the effective rent growth expectation we have this year and then those other income items dilute that just a bit.
John Kim : So is there a likelihood that you're going to achieve above the midpoint of your guidance?
Al Campbell: I'm just saying that the guidance is -- we think the guidance is accurate. There are things other than effective rents that are affecting that total revenue, John. There's items that are other income related that are growing call it, 2% to 3% that bring that down. So if you're looking at total revenue, I think the -- we brought it in just because we narrowed it, which we typically do, just because we have a little more information getting closer to the end of the year, but that midpoint of 6.25% in total revenue, we still feel that's the right number.
John Kim : Okay. My second question is on the insurance premium that you got 20%. I know that's in line with your guidance, but it still came in probably lower than many of us had expected. And I'm wondering if there was any change in the coverage that you had to get that premium, whether it's self-insuring or reduced coverage or anything else?
Rob DelPriore: Yes, John, this is Rob. Yes, in part, the cost -- the property insurance premium is a big driver of it. It was up about 33%, and that was offset by a much smaller increase in our casualty lines, automobile workers' comp, general liability. So the balance result, as you said, was about 20%. We did have some changes on the retentions this year, about $1 million on our per occurrence and a couple of million dollars on our aggregate then we do have a separate freeze event deductible because of some of the events that were happening in the Southeast. But overall, we feel like the retentions that we have are appropriate given the balance sheet strength we have and the spread of risk across the portfolio, given the geographic disbursement. And then as we've done for several years, we did take a portion of the primary insurance that we've got about $10 milllion of self-retention there that we feel very comfortable with, with an insurance product that caps our loss over 3 years at $15million or so. So I feel like we're in really good shape there relative to the strength of the balance sheet.
Operator: And we will move next to John Pawlowski with Green Street.
John Pawlowski : Brad or Eric, I just had a follow-up question regarding the glimpses and signs of better acquisition opportunities you're starting to see. Can you just give me a sense for whether you're seeing notable signs and broad-based sign of capitulation on pricing from merchant builders struggling with higher debt service costs on their lease ups?
Brad Hill: Yes, John, this is Brad. Yes, I would say we're not seeing capitulation at this point. I think what we're seeing is selectively developers are looking to take some risk off the table on select assets when it makes sense for them to do so. I mean just for context in the first quarter, we track, I think, 7 deals that we had data points on. We're up to, call it, 14 in the second quarter. But I would also say the majority of those are not necessarily merchant developed assets. So again, not a lot of data points there. We've seen a few but not broad-based. I do think that, that is what we continue to monitor because as we get later into this year, to my comments earlier, I think the merchant developer profile and need to transact increases. But we haven't seen that really open up broadly at the moment.
Eric Bolton: And John, I would tell you, as you get later in the year and you get into the slower leasing season sort of during the holidays and Q1 of next year, a lot of these lease-ups are going to see more pressure. Just leasing traffic is not as robust during that time of the year. And so we do think that we're heading into an environment where more likely than not pressure will build for some of the lease-up projects that are happening out there, and that may trigger some opportunity.
John Pawlowski : Okay. Makes sense. Final question for me. Tim, you talked about the mid-tier markets outperforming over coming quarters. Could you just give us a sense a rough range of the blended rent spreads you expect in your mid-tier markets over the second half of this year versus the more supply lead in larger metros?
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean, it obviously varies by market. There are some doing much better than others. But I would say and depending on what -- which market you divide in mid-tier versus not, you're probably somewhere in 100 to 150 basis point blended spread. So year-to-date, we're seeing several that are in that 4.5% to 5% range compared to our upper 3s overall portfolio. So I do think 100 to 200 basis points spread is probably about right.
Operator: And we will move next to Rob Stevenson with Janney.
Rob Stevenson : I know you have quite a lot of data on your residents. Do you have the data on the percentage of residents with student loans outstanding? And what do you think the resumption of payments is going to have impact wise on ability to pass-through future rent increases in '24?
Tim Argo: Yes, Rob, this is Tim. We talked about that a little bit. We do not have insight into that. We outsource sort of our credit check and income verification. So we don't have insight into that, certainly at any broad level and actually as part of income qualification and rent-to-income checks, you're not allowed to use student debt as part of that. So really don't have much insight into that, to be honest.
Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then, Al, how are you reading Texas in terms of this property taxes going forward? Is this just a onetime distribution of the surplus? Or are you expecting to see fundamental changes there and lower levels of property taxes in Texas going forward?
Al Campbell: No, Rob, we would read this at some level, it should be an ongoing benefit. I mean every -- what we've seen over the last several years is Texas because of the strength of the state has had really high valuations come out, property valuations. And we've seen millage rate rollbacks some more than others in different municipalities because of that because there is some limitation at the revenue level and budgetary level on taxes they can do. So we had projected a rate rollback. Now this because the overall budget surplus goes well beyond that. And so they basically recognizing that the [indiscernible] are full, recognizing that the state is doing very well, but valuations overall are very strong. So they're permanently reducing that rate, if you would, by legislation. Now the other side of that is in the future, if the economy in Texas is different, they could undo it. But this should be a permanent ongoing impact that's pretty significant. I mean it caps out to be something like $0.20 per $100 of value for your property values, and that's pretty significant.
Rob Stevenson : And any other markets where you're seeing property taxes trending above or below your expectations from earlier this year?
Al Campbell: Not really. I think the one outstanding to really get the final information on other than Texas is Florida. It's the one that comes in late. And so we need to see the millage rates there. We've got the values. We need to see the millage rates coming in like a pretty significant. But other than that, getting a pretty clear picture at this point. We're about 70% of the knowledge at this point, I would say, Rob.
Operator: And our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays.
Anthony Powell : Just wanted to walk through maybe the medium-term outlook for lease spreads. It sounds like you expect new lease spreads to be in the 0% to 1% range for the next couple of quarters. Is that renewals go to 0% to 1% maybe early next year as well? Or kind of remain above new for a while?
Tim Argo: Yes. I think I would expect renewals to remain above new, and that's not unusual. I mean, what we saw last year where new lease rates were quite a bit higher than renewals is more the exception than the norm. And so with renewals, you've got obviously, somebody that has lived with you and hopefully you provided good resident service and have an asset that they enjoy living in, and so there's some friction costs to move and all that. So typically, we would see renewals pretty consistently above new leases. So I don't expect it to get down to the new lease level.
Anthony Powell : Got it. And can you remind us what's your peak level of supply delivery on a quarterly basis? Is it first half of next year? And just when do you think supply starts to come down in your market?
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean it's difficult to nail down to a quarter, but I think our belief right now is kind of peaking early 2024 and then starting to trend down and then really set up for a good position as we get into 2025 in terms of lower deliveries.
Operator: We have no further questions. I'll hand the call to MAA for closing remarks.
Eric Bolton : We appreciate everyone joining us this morning and obviously follow up with any other questions that you may have. And that's all we have this morning. So thank you for joining us.
Operator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the MAA First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded today April 27th, 2023. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer Senior Vice President Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments. Please go ahead.
Andrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Phyllis and good morning everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 1934 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric. 
Eric Bolton: Thanks Andrew and good morning. As detailed in our earnings release, first quarter results were ahead of expectations as solid demand for apartment housing continues across our portfolio. Consistent with the trends that we've seen for the past couple of years, solid employment conditions, positive net migration trends, and the high cost of single-family ownership are supporting continued demand for apartment housing across our portfolio. And while new supply deliveries are expected to run higher over the next few quarters, we continue to see net positive absorption across our portfolio. We believe that MAA's more affordable price point coupled with the unique diversification strategy including both large and secondary markets further supported by an active redevelopment program will help mitigate some of the pressure from higher new supply in several of our markets. As outlined in our earnings release our team is capturing steady progress and strong results from our various redevelopment and unit interior upgrade programs. We are on target to complete over 5,000 additional unit interior upgrades this year in addition to completing installation of new smart home technology for the entire portfolio. We're also making great progress with our more extensive property repositioning projects with the projects completed to-date capturing NOI yields in the high teens on incremental capital investment. These projects, coupled with a number of new technology initiatives, should provide additional performance upside from our existing portfolio. Our new development and lease-up pipeline is performing well and we remain on track to start four new development projects later this year. Our various lease-up projects have achieved rents that are close to 11% ahead of pro forma. We did not close on any acquisitions or dispositions during the quarter, but continue to believe that transaction activity will pick up over the summer and have kept our assumptions for the year in place. The portfolio is well-positioned for the important summer leasing season. Total occupancy exposure at the end of the quarter which is a combination of current vacancy plus notices to move out is consistent with where we stood at the same point last year. In addition leasing traffic remains solid with on-site visits in comparison to the number of exposed units that we have is actually running slightly ahead of prior year. A number of new leasing tools that we implemented over the course of last year should continue to support stronger execution and our teams are well prepared for the upcoming summer leasing season. I want to thank our associates for their hard work over the last few months to position us for continued solid performance over the balance of the year. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments and I'll now turn the call over to Tim.
Tim Argo: Thanks, Eric and good morning, everyone. Same-store growth for the quarter was ahead of our expectations with stable occupancy, low resident turnover and rent performance slightly ahead of what we expected. Blended lease-over-lease pricing of 3.9% reflects the normal seasonality pattern that we expected. And while we did return to a more typical seasonal pattern in Q1, it is worth noting that the blended lease-over-lease pricing captured was higher than our typical Q1 performance. As discussed last quarter, we expected new lease pricing to show typical seasonality and that the renewal pricing which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022 would provide a catalyst to first quarter pricing performance. This played out as expected with new lease pricing down slightly at negative 0.5%, and renewal pricing increasing positive 8.6%. Alongside the strong pricing performance average daily occupancy remained steady at 95.5% for the first quarter contributing to overall same-store revenue growth of 11%. The various demand factors we monitor were strong in the first quarter and continued that way into April. 60-day exposure which represents all current vacant units plus those units with notices to vacate over the next 60 days at the end of Q1 was largely consistent with prior year at 7.7% versus 7.9% in the first quarter of last year. Furthermore in the first quarter, lead volume was higher than last year and quarterly resident turnover was down driving the 12-month rolling turnover rate down 30 basis points from 2022. April to-date trends remain consistent as exposure remains in line with the prior year and occupancy has remained steady at 95.5%. Blended lease-over-lease pricing effective in April is 4.1% with new lease pricing beginning to accelerate up 110 basis points from March at plus 0.2% and renewal pricing remaining strong at 7.9%. We expect renewal pricing to moderate some against tougher comps as we move into the late spring and summer, but simultaneously expect some seasonal acceleration in new lease-over-lease rates. We expect new supply in several of our markets to remain elevated in 2023 putting some pressure on rent growth. But as mentioned the various demand indicators remain strong and we expect our portfolio to continue to benefit from population growth, new household formations and steady job growth. In addition, we expect resident turnover to remain low as single-family affordability challenges support fewer move-outs. MAA's unique market diversification of portfolio strategy coupled with a more affordable price point as compared to the new product being delivered also helps lessen some of the pressures surrounding higher new supply deliveries. During the quarter, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of smart home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the first quarter of 2023, we completed over 1,300 interior unit upgrades and installed over 18,000 smart home packages. We now have about 90,000 units with smart home technology and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023. For our repositioning program leases have been fully or partially repriced at the first 13 properties in the program and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on cost in the upper teens. We have another seven projects that will begin repricing in the second and third quarters and are evaluating an additional group of properties to potentially begin construction later in 2023. Those are all of my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Brad. 
Brad Hill: Thank you, Tim and good morning, everyone. While operating fundamentals across our platform have remained consistent as Tim just outlined transaction volume remains muted due to a lack of for-sale inventory on the market. For high-quality well-located properties bidding is strong and available capital is aggressively competing in order to win the bid and put capital to work. This strong relative investor demand coupled with often favorable in-place financing continues to support stronger-than-expected cap rates on closed transactions. Having said that, we believe the need to sell increases as the year progresses and it's likely that more compelling acquisition opportunities will materialize later in the year. Therefore, we have maintained our acquisition forecast for the year, but have pushed the timing back a couple of months. Our acquisition team remains active in the market and Al and his team have our balance sheet in great shape and ready to support our transaction needs. The properties managed by our lease-up team continue to outperform our original expectations generating higher earnings and creating additional long-term value. To-date our new lease-up properties' performance does not appear to be impacted by increased supply pressures. As Eric mentioned, these properties have achieved rents nearly 11% above our original expectations. During the first quarter, we began pre-leasing at our Novel Daybreak community in Salt Lake City, and early leasing demand is extremely strong with the property currently 11.5% pre-leased at rents well ahead of our expectations. Predevelopment work continues to progress on a number of projects, four of which should start construction in the back half of 2023: two in-house developments, one located in Orlando and one in Denver and two pre-purchased joint venture developments, one located in Charlotte and the other a Phase 2 to our West Midtown development in Atlanta. During the first quarter we purchased a Phase 2 land site to our Packing District project in Orlando Florida, bringing our future development projects owned or under construction to 12, representing over 3,300 units. Over the past few months, we have seen an increase in inbound pre-purchase development opportunities due to a substantial decline in the availability of both debt and equity capital for new developments. We remain disciplined and selective in our review process but we are hopeful these calls will lead to additional currently unidentified development opportunities. Any project we start over the next 12 to 18 months would likely deliver in 2026 or 2027 and should be well positioned to capitalize on what we believe is likely to be a much stronger leasing environment reflective of the significant slowdown in new starts that we expect to continue to see over the balance of 2023 and 2024. Our construction management team remains focused on completing and delivering our six under construction projects and are doing a tremendous job managing these projects and working with our contractors to minimize inflationary and supply chain pressures on our development costs and our schedules. We have two projects that we'll be delivering units during the second quarter Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City, which delivered six units late in the first quarter and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. And with that I'll turn it over to Al. 
Al Campbell: Thank you, Brad and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.28 for the quarter was $0.06 above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. About half of this favorability was related to the timing of certain expenses, which are now expected to be incurred over the remainder of the year, primarily related to real estate taxes. Operating fundamentals overall were slightly favorable to expectations for the quarter producing about $0.01 per share of favorability. And the remaining outperformance is related to overhead and net interest costs for the quarter. Our balance sheet remains in great shape, providing both protection from market volatility and capacity for strong future growth. We received an upgrade from Moody's during the quarter bringing our investment-grade rating to the A3 or A- level with all three agencies. We expect the favorable ratings to have a growing positive impact on our cost of capital as we work through future debt maturities. During the quarter, we also closed on the settlement of our forward equity agreement providing approximately $204 million net proceeds towards funding our development and other capital needs. We funded $38 million of redevelopment, repositioning and smart home installation costs during the quarter producing solid yields. We also funded just over $65 million of development costs during the quarter toward the projected $300 million for the full year. As Brad mentioned, we expect to start several new deals later this year and early next year, likely expanding our development pipeline to over $1 billion, for which our balance sheet is – remains well positioned to support. We ended the quarter with record low leverage, our debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times with over $1.4 billion of combined cash and available capacity under our credit facility with 100% of our debt fixed against rising interest rates for an average of 7.7 years and with minimal near-term debt maturities. And finally in order to reflect the first quarter earnings performance, we are increasing our core FFO guidance for the full year to a midpoint of $9.11 per share, which is a $0.03 per share increase. We're also slightly narrowing the full year range to $8.93 and $9.29 per share. Given that the majority of the Q1 same-store outperformance was timing related and the bulk of the leasing season is ahead of us, we are maintaining our same-store guidance ranges as well as all of the key ranges for the year. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Phyllis, we will now turn the call back over to you for questions. Phyllis, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: Absolutely. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Kim John with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
John Kim: Thank you. Eric and Tim both mentioned in your prepared remarks that the more affordable price point is one of the reasons why you have such strong demand. And I'm wondering if there's any notable difference between your A and B product as far as demand or performance?
Tim Argo: Yeah, John, this is Tim. I mean we are seeing a little bit of a diversion not significant I would say in Q1, our what you might call our more B assets were about 70 basis points or so higher on blended pricing versus the more A and some things -- part of it is some of the price point. And certainly to the extent we've seen some supply pressure more of it's coming in typically in the more urban or A style types of assets.
John Kim: Okay. My second question is on the premiums that you're getting on renewals versus the new leases signed. I think it was 900 basis points in the first quarter, a little bit lower than 800 basis points in the second quarter so far. It still seems like a record amount as far as that premium you're getting. And I'm wondering when you think it goes back to the norm. At what level do you think it's fair premium on renewals?
Tim Argo: Yeah. I mean, we talked about a little bit last quarter that we knew with the unusual circumstances of last year where new lease pricing was ahead of renewal pricing for the bulk of 2022 that set us up with some good comps and some opportunity on the renewal side particularly in the first call it fix, six months in 2023. And so that's definitely what we've seen. I think as we get a little further in you'll see it moderate to more normal. I think it'd probably get down to the 6% or so range over the next few months, but don't expect it to be too volatile. We still think renewals will outpace new leases but get into a little bit more normalized range.
John Kim: That’s great color. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hey, good morning everybody. Eric, you have highlighted that the price point does provide you some insulation as it relates to new supply. And certainly job growth has surprised to the upside earlier this year. If we start to see job growth slow, does that become more concerning as supply begins to ramp? And does pricing power just become more challenging for you later this year and maybe into early 2024?
Eric Bolton: Well, Austin, certainly if we see the employment markets pull back in any material way that will have an effect on demand at some level. I think that we've been through those periods before where the employment markets get much weaker. And there's no doubt that such a scenario does have an effect on demand. Having said that, we're in I think a unique -- all these cycles have their own unique elements to them. And in this particular cycle the -- what we see happening in the single-family market and the lack of single-family affordability is clearly working in our favor right now. And I would also suggest to you that in the event of a recession where there is weakness in the employment markets what really helps us at least on a relative basis I think is the fact that we are oriented in the Sunbelt. I think these Sunbelt markets have demonstrated historically an ability to weather downturn more so than some of the higher density coastal markets that tend to be more dominated by financial services insurance and banking. The diversification that we have in our -- that's one of the slides in our presentation deck that you can look at the latest presentation deck that really gives some insight on the diversification we have not only in markets but also in the employment sectors that we cater to that our residents work in. And I think that diversification coupled with the Sunbelt some of the other things that are relating to single family and so forth, while I think a recession certainly creates concern for everybody in the apartment sector. I think that I'm confident as we have historically always done in downturns that we'll likely hold up better.
Austin Wurschmidt: No. That's all very helpful. And then just for my follow-up for projects that are in lease-up today have you kind of -- have you seen any slowdown in the pace of lease-up or absorption for those? And where are concessions today for yes assets in lease-up? Thank you.
Brad Hill: Yeah. Hey. Austin, this is Brad. We really haven't seen any impact negative impact associated with supply pressures on our new lease-ups. And generally that's where you'd think we would see it first. We've got six or so projects that are in lease-up right now. Concessions on those we typically model about a month free. I'd say on three of those we're using some concession maybe up to 0.5 month free. We're not using the full concessions that we underwrote and we're not seeing the need to just generally, based on what we're seeing in the market. And I'd say our traffic continues to be really good on all of our lease-ups. The leases we're signing the velocity is really, really good. So we're not seeing any early indications yet, but that new supply is having an impact there.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks everybody.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Chandni Luthra: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. You guys talked about in your prepared remarks that cap rates are still going strong for good quality product. Could you remind us where they are tracking at the moment? And then, as you think about your own opportunity set down the line as you think about distressed opportunities emanating from the current supply situation and lending markets. Where would cap rates need to be for you to be comfortable buying and getting in the market?
Brad Hill: Yeah, this is Brad. I'll certainly jump on that. We continue to see cap rates call it in the 4.7, 4.75 range for assets that fit that description well located strong markets. Interestingly in the first quarter, I mean, we only had seven data points. So again, it's -- the volume is down call it 70% year-over-year. So we don't have a whole lot of data points. But interestingly the band of those seven trades is pretty close together so -- which we haven't seen that historically. I would say for us cap rates definitely need to be over 5, 5.25, 5.5 something in that range. But I would say it's really going to depend on the asset what the rent trajectory looks like. And we're also looking at the after CapEx what it looks like in that nature as well. So that's pretty important to us. And I would say where opportunities might come for us are going to be properties that are early in their lease-up. That's where some of these developers tend to get a little bit more stress in their underwriting and in their performance. As some of the supply in our markets begins to come online some of these less experienced operators that are operating some of these new lease-ups could potentially struggle a bit to lease up those assets. And so I do think that's going to be an opportunity for us. And in fact that's really what our acquisition forecast is built on is buying assets that are in their initial stage of lease-up.
Chandni Luthra: That's very helpful. Thank you. And for my follow-up, as we think about new supply from a geographic standpoint, what are the markets where you're seeing most pressure? And how are you thinking about balancing occupancy versus pricing in those markets?
Tim Argo: Hi Chandni, this is Tim. Right now I'd Austin is probably the number one market in terms of where we're seeing supply. And Phoenix to an extent we're seeing a little bit. Honestly, some of the higher supply markets we're seeing like, Raleigh and Charlotte, Charleston are three of the markets where we're seeing a fair amount of supply have also been some of our best pricing markets so far this year. So as Eric kind of laid out earlier, we're not seeing a lot of pressure yet from supply. We're still getting the job growth and demand. There's, pockets here and there. But right now as we did in Q1, we're happy to keep pushing on price where we can. Our occupancy is at a stable point. And there's, a lot of things we monitor as kind of leading-edge demand indicators but still in a healthy balance right now.
Chandni Luthra: Great. Thanks for taking my question.
Operator: We will go next over to Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is open.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Earlier you talked about the B product outperforming A product on a portfolio level. I was wondering if we can dive into a market or two to just kind of better understand some of the dynamics of what you're seeing in the A product versus the B product? And then, also, within that, can we talk about kind of like the larger markets that you're in versus the smaller markets? And if A versus B is performing differently in the large ones versus the smaller ones? Thanks.
Tim Argo: Yes. It's fairly consistent, I would say. Atlanta is probably a good example where we have quite a bit of diversification there. We've got several assets kind of in town, Midtown, Buckhead and then a lot of assets outside the perimeter and we're pretty consistently seeing the suburban assets perform better than those more urban assets. And that's playing out relatively consistent across some of the markets. We are seeing, what you might call, our secondary markets perform pretty well. I mentioned Charleston a moment ago. Savannah, Greenville some of these more secondary markets are holding up very well and doing really well in terms of pricing. And that's part of the strategy. I mean, typically those markets aren't going to get quite as much of the supply as some of these larger markets and that's playing out for us pretty well so far. 
Michael Goldsmith: Got you. And then, my follow-up question, just on the -- we talked about the job market and how the portfolio may react to that. I guess, my question is more related to just the in-migration to the Sunbelt. And what's that looking like versus pre-COVID levels? And are there any markets that you're seeing, where it is stronger or weaker in-migrations?
Eric Bolton: Michael, this is Eric. I would tell you that the in-migration that we're -- we saw in the first quarter with about 11% of the leases that we are writing, a function of people moving into the Sunbelt, that's pretty consistent with where we were prior to COVID. It began to move up a bit during 2020, late 2020 and throughout most of 2021, and then it started moderating a little bit in 2022. But right now, as we sit here today, roughly 11% or so of the move-ins that we are seeing are coming from people moving in from outside the Sunbelt. And that compares to 9% to 10% that we saw prior to COVID. Move-outs from the Sunbelt, the turnover we have where people are leaving us and moving out of the Sunbelt is still only about 3% to 4% of the move-outs that we're having are a function of people leaving the region. So, on a net basis, we're pretty close to where we were prior to COVID and would expect that those trends will likely now continue at the current level going forward.
Michael Goldsmith: And when you say going forward, does that mean for the rest of 2023, or is that kind of for the intermediate term?
Eric Bolton: I would say the rest of 2023 into 2024. I think that, again, harking back to my earlier comments relating to the potential for moderation in the employment markets, we've seen these trends through these cycles that we've been through over the years, where migration trends are more positive, if you will, in the Sunbelt region. And it's been that way for many, many years, through recessions and through expansions in the economy. That continues to be the case. And so, I just continue to think that these markets and the portfolio strategy we have will serve us well long term. And I think the net positive migration trends that we see today will likely persist for the foreseeable future. 
Michael Goldsmith: Thank you, very much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Nick Yulico: Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping to get a little bit of a feel for how the new lease growth on signings is differing by market. Just sort of an order of magnitude between better versus weaker markets, if you can give a little color on that. 
Tim Argo: Yeah. Nick it's Tim. So if we think about where April is, it's anywhere from call it negative 1%, negative 2% for some of the lower markets, up to 3%, 4%, 5% on some markets. And it moved positive in April. As we talked about we're at 0.2% and we saw a good acceleration from March to April. We kind of expect to see that typical seasonality and a little more acceleration as we move through the spring and summer, but that gives you a little bit of an order of magnitude. 
Nick Yulico: That's helpful. Thanks. Do you mind also just maybe saying which markets are the better versus weaker in that range?
Tim Argo: Yeah. I mean, as I mentioned before, Austin is one of the weaker ones. Austin and Phoenix are two that I would point out as a little bit on the weaker side. Orlando continues to be one of our strongest markets. And then I mentioned a moment ago as well we're seeing some of our more secondary markets perform really well. Also Charleston, Savannah, Richmond Greenville all holding up really well also.
Nick Yulico: Thanks. That's helpful. Just last question is on Atlanta. If you look the occupancy there is a bit lower than the rest of the portfolio. Can you just talk about what's going on there? And I guess also on Packing, I think you were saying that that's a market where suburban is doing better than urban. And so I'm not sure if it's -- if there's any sort of supply impact there that you're dealing with on occupancy or what's driving that? Thanks.
Tim Argo: Sure. Yeah, Atlanta is a little bit of a unique situation. So back in February, we had some winter storms. It affected Texas and Georgia also, but we particularly saw some impact in Atlanta and Georgia. We had about 70 units in Atlanta that were down that we took out of service through the storm and then brought them back up kind of in late February. So you had a pretty good chunky units in Atlanta that we had to get leased up. So that was really the occupancy story there. We've seen it kind of bottomed out in March, but we have seen April occupancy pick up. So I think Atlanta will continue to improve and be a pretty solid market for us later in the year.
Nick Yulico: Appreciate it.
Operator: We will go next to Alan Peterson with Green Street. Your line is open.
Alan Peterson: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time. Tim, I was just hoping you can shed some light on your planning for peak leasing. And if you're anticipating in some of your weaker markets whether or not you're going to have to use concessions to maintain occupancy call out the Austins or the Phoenixes of the world. 
Tim Argo: Yeah. I mean there will be pockets. We're not -- we certainly haven't seen -- don't expect to see it at any sort of portfolio-wide level. If we look at Q1 total concessions were about 25 basis points as a percent of rent. We are seeing a little more in Austin call it half a month up to a month and then there's areas where if there's lease-up properties you may see a little bit more markets like Orlando, we're seeing no concessions, but we'll see it a little bit but I don't think any more than half to a month more than what we're kind of seeing right now. I don't really see it getting much different than what we see today.
Alan Peterson: Understood. And that's on your assets or other competing assets nearby?
Tim Argo: More so on competing assets. I mean we have some. As I mentioned there's -- it's pretty minimal. And it kind of depends on the market. There are some markets where upfront concessions are more of staying in that market whereas others it's more of a net pricing scenario where you don't really see upfront concessions. So it kind of depends, but similar whether it's our properties or the market in general.
Alan Peterson: Appreciate that. And Brad just one follow-up on your prepared remarks about debt and equity capital starting to dry up. The cost of buckets of capital out there where are some of your private peers the most concerned about when sourcing new financing today? What are some of the -- whether it be the banks or life insurance companies what buckets of capital right now are the ones that are seeing the most impact there?
Brad Hill: Yeah. I mean most of our partners use bank financing for their developments. And so I'd say that's the biggest concern at this point. And given the last few weeks and just the restriction there in capital with banks, it's more acute than it has been. First quarter, it was difficult. Equity was difficult. Debt was difficult. And I'd say the debt piece has gotten even more difficult for them. But generally, they're going to regional banks for their banking needs. And they generally have strong relationships with these banks, so they can get a deal or two done with the banks but it's a lot more difficult. It takes a lot longer than what it has in the past. And so that's really restricting. One of the other areas that it's restricting new deals getting done and I don't see that changing for the foreseeable future.
Alan Peterson: Appreciate that. Thanks for your time today guys.
Operator: We'll go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Eric or Brad, you guys added Orlando land parcel this quarter. But overall how aggressively are you going to be in adding additional land parcels for development at this point? And are you seeing any relief in terms of the costs of land? Some of the peers have spoken about more office sites and vacant movie theaters and as such being sold for apartment development allowing for better deals. Curious as to what you're seeing in terms of that.
Brad Hill: Yes Rob, this is Brad. As I mentioned we have 12 sites now that we either own or control. So we feel like we're in a good spot in terms of building out our pipeline going forward. And as Al mentioned, we think we're on pace for that $1 billion $1.2 billion or so in terms of projects going and we like where we're located. The asset that we purchased in Orlando is a Phase two to a project that we'll start this year. So there was a strategic reason for that. It's really a covered land play. There's some leased buildings on it right now. So, I'd say going forward, we'll be a bit more cautious on land. I would say, we'll continue to look for sites that have been dropped by other developers. We'll look to get time. A couple of the sites we have now, as I mentioned, are we control them we do not own them. So that's our preference to have time on the deals. And I'd say we're on the early stages or it appears that we're in the early stages of land repricing a bit in some areas. We've seen a 10% price reduction on some of the projects that some of the -- our partners are coming to us with sites for. They've been able to negotiate some additional time and some cost reduction. So I think we're on the early stages of that at this point.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Tim or Al, where is bad debt or delinquency today? And how does that compare to the historical periods pre-COVID in recent comparable periods?
Tim Argo: Yes Rob, this is Tim. So if we look at Q1, for example, all the rents that we billed in Q1, we collected 99.4% of that, so 60 basis points of bad debt which is consistent right in line with where we were last year. If you factor in prior month collections and any collection agency, it goes down about 50 basis points. So really remains pretty minimal.
Rob Stevenson: And is there any markets in particular that you're seeing any material higher amounts in?
Tim Argo: Atlanta is probably the one I would point out, where it's just still kind of the court system and everything going on there. It's taken a little longer to move through the process. So it's our highest one right now, probably closer to around 1% or so. But that's really the only market where we're seeing that.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate the time.
Operator: And we will go next to Omotayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.
Omotayo Okusanya: Hello, can you hear me?
Al Campbell: Yes.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes. Hi, everyone. Hoping you can help me understand the increase in guidance a little bit better. Again you kind of talked about in 1Q you had some OpEx kind of tailwinds that could potentially become headwinds going forward. So you're not changing same-store NOI. But so trying to really understand what was that slide into is number one? And then number two, it sounds like based on spring leasing fees and you see the FFO guidance with them.
Al Campbell: Yes Tayo, that's a good question. As we talked about a little bit, we -- the first quarter obviously we outperformed $0.06 according to our midpoint. And about half of that was timing as I mentioned. It's really some expenses some favorability we had in the first quarter. The bulk of that was real estate taxes that, we still think our full year guidance number is correct, so we'll fill that over the year. So the first $0.03 increase in core FFO was the other items coming through. I would say a-third of that or $0.01 was really operating forms. As Tim mentioned, we were favorable particularly in pricing. It was for the first quarter what we expect. I think we -- if you remember our guidance or our discussion in same guidance was that our pricing expectation for the full year was 3% and the quarter first quarter is 3.9%. So that's a little bit of favorability. But given that, we have the bulk of the leasing season ahead of us a lot of work to be done we just felt like our ranges in our guidance are still where they need to be there. And the other part of the favorability of FFO that flowed through were things below NOI overhead interest and those things. So really the same store was good that we were -- I would call it favorable slightly favorable to on point of what we expected. And we'll wait to see what happens over the next couple of quarters. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then can you just talk a bit about kind of new lease spreads for the quarter? Again that was kind of -- it was negative. Just kind of see as the thoughts there whether it really is a supply issue whether there's a bit more of a demand issue and how we should kind of think about that kind of especially going into like your core spring leasing season?
Tim Argo: Yeah. Tayo this is Tim. I mean I think one thing to keep in mind the new lease rates that we saw in Q1 are really pretty typical, if we go back through history. If you look outside of last year the kind of the lease rates we were seeing were pretty much in line or better frankly than most of the years we've been tracking it. So it was pretty much as expected. I mean March new lease rates dropped a little bit and it was really more function of similar to what I was talking about with Atlanta earlier where we saw leasing activity drop for a couple of weeks there in February with some of the stores, particularly in Texas and Georgia that impacted occupancy a little bit in February. And then we were able to regain that occupancy in March but it did come at the expense a little bit of some of the new lease pricing but as we talked about with April where we saw new lease spreads accelerate and move positive. So from where we sit right now all the demand metrics look strong exposures, where we want it leads traffic volume all that is where we would expect. So I think we'll move into the rest of the spring and the summer a strong leasing season and see some acceleration and see what we would typically expect out of a pretty strong supply-demand dynamic. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Thank you.
Operator: And we will go next to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Barry Luo: This is Barry Luo on for Haendel St. Juste. My first question was on property taxes. I was just wondering how that was trending versus expectations since Cato's release in the back half?
Al Campbell: Yes, this is Al. I can give you some color on that. So right now, we expect that our estimates that we put out in our guidance for property taxes we left that the same. We think we still have a good range that we've got. We did have some favorability in the first quarter on property taxes, as I just mentioned a minute ago but really that's related to the timing of some of the activity. We had some -- the appeals from prior year they come in and the timing can be different year-to-year. We had some wins that we achieved in the first quarter on some of our prior year pills that were good. We got them a little earlier than we thought. We still have a lot of fights both for prior year to go and a lot of the information for this year to come in. So on balance we have about 6.25% growth that we expected for this year. We still -- at the midpoint of our guidance we still think that is right. I would tell you that, we still in terms of current year don't have a lot of information yet. We feel like we have a good view on value but a lot of the information the stubs from the municipalities come out probably mostly in the second quarter. So as we're talking next quarter I should have 60% to 70% knowledge on that. And then the millage rates will come more in the third and even some in the fourth quarter. So we feel like our range is good. I would say that, we've continued -- the pressures coming from Texas, Florida and Georgia that's continuing to be the case as it has been for several years. I would say that, as we move forward into 2024 as they're looking backwards toward this more normalized year hopefully we begin to see some moderation in that line.
Barry Luo: Got Okay. Thank you. And just we get Texas in particular so noticing a significant expense decline sequentially so 11% for Fort Worth and I think 6% for Austin. Is some of that being driven by property tax relief, or what's kind of driving that? Thanks.
Al Campbell: I think there's some property tax in that for sure, but I mean Tim can answer, as well. But I think overall, we expected the first quarter expenses for all categories together in the company has held to be pretty high in the first quarter. Really, for many of the groupings because of the comparisons for last year, as we saw inflation kind of come into our business more in the second third and fourth quarter last year, we expected our property -- our operating expenses to be high.  Actually, they were 8.3% so where we came out was favorable to our expectations, what we had said as Tim mentioned. So what we would expect to see is some key items, personnel, repair and maintenance begin to moderate as we move back into the second third and fourth quarter of the year, with really the outstanding points of continued pressure being taxes, insurance areas primarily. Does that answer the question? 
Barry Luo: So – well, I was more looking at like the sequential decline from 4Q in Fort Worth versus 1Q in Fort Worth looks like somewhere [indiscernible] 
Eric Bolton: Decline in…
Tim Argo: Yes. I think the sequential decline all those Texas markets, I think was pretty much real estate tax relief. Just the timing of accruals and settlements, and all that it can be pretty volatile from quarter-to-quarter, but normalizes over the course of the year. 
Al Campbell: Yes. And that's where you're seeing, some of those items particularly in Texas, where we had the real estate tax prior appeals coming in, that's some of that occurring. 
Barry Luo: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we will go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you. And good morning, down there. So two questions. First, just going back to the supply just because it's a big topic that always comes up with the Sunbelt. You guys, articulated a lot of how your portfolio is doing. Would you say, it's more just your rent versus new supply, or would you say, it's more just proximity meaning that your properties are less of -- end up less likely to be near where the new supply is? Meaning that, the new supply is in other parts of the market and therefore, like where you cited some supply-heavy markets where you guys actually did well, it's because just proximity in general your portfolio doesn't line up where a lot of the new product is being built. I'm just trying to understand. 
Eric Bolton: Hi, Alex, this is Eric. I would say, it's both of the points that you're making that are at play here. Where we do see supply coming into a market more often than not it is in some of the more urban-oriented submarkets. And when you look at our portfolio, and the footprint we have and the diversification we have, across a number of these markets particularly the big cities like Atlanta and Dallas, we have generally more exposure to the suburban markets versus the urban markets. So, I think there is a supply proximity point, that I would point to that you're mentioning that probably works in our favor to some degree. It's hard to -- and it will vary of course by market. And then the other thing, that you pointed to which I think is also at play here, is the price point that broadly we have our portfolio. When you look at the average effective rent per unit of our portfolio and compare it to the average rent of the new product coming into the markets, we still are somewhere in the 25% plus or minus range below where new product is pricing. And again, it will vary a bit by market, but that certainly provides some level of protection against the supply pressure and offers the rental market, a great value play in renting from us versus something that may be down the street that's newer but considerably more expensive. And with some of the renovation work that we're doing, frankly that's what creates the opportunity for us to do some of this renovation work and effectively offer the resident in the market, what it feels like a brand-new apartment on the interior but still at a meaningful discount to what they would have to pay in rent for something brand new. So, there are a multitude of factors that play and it varies by market. But certainly, we cannot absolutely eliminate new supply pressure but there after being in this region for 30 years, we've learned how to do some things to help at least mitigate the pressure, a little bit here and there. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Second question is, on insurance certainly a hot topic especially in Florida and Texas with big premium jumps. Are you guys seeing opportunities where some of your smaller players or maybe some of the merchant recent new developments may have -- they may not have underwritten 50% type premium increases and therefore that could gin up some buying opportunities? Do you think that you would see that potentially people having to sell because of insurance pressure? 
Brad Hill: This is Brad. I definitely think that that is something to keep an eye on. I do think the market down there right now is extremely tough. And depending on where you are in Tampa or South Florida, those insurance premiums are increasing substantially for new product. So I would say, for newly developed properties in those areas Tampa, Orlando not as much, but Jacksonville, it's something for us to keep an eye on, because I do think that the insurance premiums are going to be a lot higher than the developer underwrote than they expected. And I do think there's going to be some impact to the sales proceeds as a part of that. And so I think as you get some of the supply pressures coupled with that and some of the leasing pressures those are areas that we'll keep an eye on. And then obviously, we have the benefit with our broader portfolio and insurance pricing that that definitely is a platform benefit for us.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is open.
Wes Golladay: Hey, good morning everyone. Just had a quick question on capital allocation. I know your stock's yielding low six to maybe mid-6 implied cap. So how do you view a potential buyback versus starting new developments at this part of the cycle? 
Eric Bolton: Well, Wes, this is Eric. I would tell you right now, we believe that what really is important to have is a lot of strength in capacity on the balance sheet. Obviously, we're in a very turbulent environment at the moment. Capital markets are very turbulent. There's still obviously some level of risk in the broader economy. And so we really believe that the thing to do right now is to protect capacity and keep the balance sheet in a strong position not only for defensive reasons. But as Brad has alluded to, we do think as we get later in the year that we may see some improving opportunities on the acquisition front. We have four -- as Brad alluded to we have four projects that we may start. We're scheduled to start later this year. These are projects that would deliver in 2026 into 2027. So I think that that level of development is something that we feel very comfortable with. These would be -- of course, it's -- we're still fine-tuning a lot of the numbers and pricing is not yet locked in. But we are seeing some early indication of some relief on some of the pricing metrics. And of course by the time we get to 2026 and 2027 we think the leasing environment is likely to be pretty strong given the supply pullback that we expect to start to see happening late in 2024 and 2025. So we would anticipate that these will be some very attractive investments that we could potentially start later this year and would reconcile very nicely to even where our current cost of capital is. So we certainly understand the metrics and the math on all this and pay close attention to it. We don't think we're going to ramp up a lot more than that at this point in the cycle, but we feel pretty good about the four opportunities that we're looking at the moment. 
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then maybe if we can go to that topic of distress. I mean, a lot of the private owners right now do you feel that they may be upside down and the banks are just extending the opportunity right now, or do they have significant equity just need maybe a capital infusion? 
Brad Hill: Yes. I mean, I don't think that we are seeing any distress in the market right now. I mean the projects just like our portfolio the operating fundamentals are very strong. So even on some of these lease-ups when they underwrote them in 2021 or so the leasing fundamentals are going to be a lot stronger than what they expected. And even the joint venture projects that we started in 2021 cap rates were in the 5%, 5.5% range on the valuation. I mean, that's kind of where we are. So, I would say that the developers have been somewhat disciplined in their underwriting in the last couple of years and the operating fundamentals are outperforming. So, they won't get the pricing that they could have gotten 1.5 years ago, but there's still profit in a lot of these projects, so we're not seeing that yet. Where I think the distress could come are projects that closed a year, 1.5 years ago and they did some type of financing cap or something that's coming due and it's going to require a reset of -- or a pay down in order to get that loan rightsized and the debt service coverage rightsized. Those are going to be the ones I think that are going to have a little bit of trouble.
Wes Golladay: Great. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: And we will go next to Eric Wolfe with Citi. Your line is open.
Eric Wolfe: Just to follow up to your answer there a moment ago. You mentioned your balance sheet is just in incredible shape. I don't think I've -- can remember seeing an apartment company at sort of mid-three times leverage down to probably low three times later this year. So my question is really sort of what would it take what type of opportunity would you need to see, before you'd be willing to take your leverage back up to a more normal sort of five times amount? And I guess, if a portfolio came across that was like in say the 5.5% to 6% range, would that be interesting enough to allow you to take your leverage back up?
Eric Bolton: Well, Eric this is -- I'll start and Al you can jump in. But we do anticipate that over the course of the next year or two that we will see leverage probably edge back up just a little bit, believing that we will -- if nothing else, we've got some development funding that we'll do. And of course the funding that we're doing on our redevelopment work and repositioning work is super -- very, very accretive. And so, we will begin to see leverage move a little bit back up. But having said that, we just think right now, given the uncertainty in the broader capital markets landscape and what we imagine to be likely an opportunity for more distressed asset buying that capacity right now is a good thing to have. And so we're going to hold on to that. And I do think that obviously, if we did see some larger opportunity come across that we felt made sense for us strategically and felt like, we could do something closer to 5.5% to 6% range from a cap rate perspective that probably would certainly get our attention. And obviously, it depends on a lot of different other variables. But we like where the balance sheet is right now, given the broader landscape that we have with the capital markets and the transaction market. And so, we're going to be very cautious in how we put that capacity to work. We've got some known needs that I've just mentioned that are very attractive investments and we'll continue to move forward with those. We don't have any certainly need to go attract additional capital right now. And as Al alluded to the debt portfolio is in terrific position, a lot of duration and it's all 100% fixed. So, we're going to sit tight with what we have at the moment largely.
Al Campbell: I'll just add just quickly that Eric that's a very good point you make that really our target -- long-term target is closer to 4.5 times to 5 times on the EBITDA coverage. I mean, we're providing opportunity right now as Eric mentioned and hopefully they will find those expect to be able to find those. And long term our target is in line with what you mentioned.
Eric Wolfe: Thanks for that. And then, just on a related guidance question. You did 3.9% in terms of blended spread first quarter. It sounds like you expect to accelerate through the balance of the peak leasing season. So my question is really, just how did it get down to that 3% blend that's in your guidance? Is it just a steep dropoff later this year or just some conservative baked in there?
Al Campbell: I'm going to start with it and Tim can give some more details. What I would say primarily is, one, we need to see the bulk of leasing season happen as it comes. So we're providing opportunity to see that and get more information. We're encouraged certainly by what we saw in the first quarter. And I think secondly, the biggest point would be, we do expect to see that seasonality in the most acute if you would in the fourth quarter. That's typically what it is in a normal year. That's sort of what we're expecting. So we could see that new lease pricing be a little more negative in that fourth quarter because the holiday season and demand just really shuts down in that period. So that's what we provided for in our forecast I think at this point. 
Tim Argo: Yes, Eric, this is Tim. I mean, I think, it will kind of boil down to new lease pricing that we see over the late spring and summer will be the ball game in terms of whether it ends up a little better than we thought or a little worse. You have obviously the bulk of the leases happening during that period. And they carry for several months throughout the year. So they have certainly an outsized impact. So if those new lease rates accelerate more then it probably is a little better than we thought, if they accelerate not quite as much probably a little less because renewals are going to be relatively consistent through the rest of the year. 
Eric Wolfe: Got it. Thanks for your time.
Operator: We will go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. 
Jamie Feldman: Right. Thank you and good morning. I want to go back to your comments about 11% of leases written in the first quarter were new people moving into Sunbelt. Can you provide more color on that data point across the different markets? And I guess I'm thinking more about maybe some of the larger MSAs versus the smaller MSAs. 
Tim Argo: Yes, this is Tim. So 11% overall and probably markets you would expect. In terms of in-migration Phoenix is our top market. You have about 18% of move-ins out of the market going into Phoenix. Tampa was another big one at 15%. Charlotte was 13%. Charleston and Savannah were pretty high in there as well. And so those are the biggest drivers. And that's been pretty consistent throughout the last several quarters as the ones that are benefiting the most. 
Jamie Feldman: Interesting. And then I guess similarly if you think about the lay-up activity I guess those are also the markets where you've seen the most growth in tech jobs or jobs that might be most at risk. Can you talk at all about how lay-up activity might be impacting the different types of MSAs and even at statistics specifically? Just trying to kind of think through the next 12 months or so. 
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean we haven't seen a ton of impact yet. I mean I think certainly the technology sector is getting a lot of publicity and a lot of -- there's layoffs out there but I do think a lot of the other sectors are still in the net hiring position. Austin's one particularly in North Austin where we've seen a little bit of impact from that some of the tech jobs up in North Austin, but at the same time you've got Tesla still planning to expand over the next couple of years there. You've got Oracle moving their headquarters there. So certainly long term in Austin it's a job machine and we feel really good about that. Outside of that we haven't seen a lot. Phoenix been tight a little bit. But again we've got properties there with it's a huge semiconductor plant coming in right there in one of our properties. So there's a little bit of short-term pressure over the next few quarters, but long term feel really good about all of those markets. 
Jamie Feldman: Okay. Thank you. And then I know you talked about insurance and taxes on the expense side. Just as we think about your guidance for the year any other variables or line items on the expense side that maybe you don't feel quite as confident or maybe there could be some changes there? I know you got your insurance coming up in July your renewal. 
Al Campbell: Those are the two big items. I mean I think that expense -- the key components of expenses for the year are personnel, repair and maintenance taxes and insurance. I think we -- the first two we expect to moderate as the year progresses as we talked about and taxes and insurance remaining the biggest items that have the most unknown at this point. So that's ones we're keeping our eye on at this point. 
Jamie Feldman: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. 
Linda Tsai: Hi. Maybe just as a short follow-up to that last question. In terms of rationale for move-out job transfers and buying a new home has the balance of these reasons shifted since 4Q and any regional trends you'd highlight? 
Tim Argo: I mean it's pretty consistent. One we've seen move-outs to buy a house has dropped dramatically. As you would expect with what interest rates have done we've seen our move-outs due to rent increase drop quite a bit as well. The biggest reason for move-outs which is always consistently our largest read to put move-out is just a change in the job and job transfers and that's up a little bit. But it's -- as we've talked to people out on site it's more just people moving for another job as opposed to any significant job losses. So turnover -- it's overall is down a little bit but it's the -- some of the key reasons that we've talked about before and pretty, pretty consistent across markets no matter if larger markets or secondary markets. 
Linda Tsai: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we have no further questions. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks. 
Eric Bolton: Well no additional comments to add. So we appreciate everyone joining us and I look forward to seeing everyone at NAREIT. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MAA Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, February 22nd, 2022 [2023]. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments. Please go ahead. 
Andrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Natty and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, Tom Grimes, and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as reconciliations of the difference between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial deck. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our website atwww.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions.  I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. MAA wrapped up calendar year 2022 with fourth quarter results for core FFO that were ahead of expectations as higher fee income along with continued growth in average rent per unit and strong occupancy more than offset pressure from higher real estate taxes.  Looking ahead to the coming year, there is clearly some uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the employment markets, the pace of inflation and the broader economy. In addition, while we do know that new supply deliveries in 2023 broadly will be higher than in 2022, we continue to believe that MAA is well positioned for the coming year as the leasing market returns to more normalized conditions.  Our expectations for the coming year are built on a lease-over-lease pricing environment of 3%. This performance assumption, coupled with the earn-in from 2022's rent growth should drive growth in effective rent per unit of around 7% over the coming year. We will, of course, see conditions vary some by market and submarket location, but we believe that our portfolio is in a uniquely solid position to weather expected moderation from the historically high rate growth of last year.  This view is really supported by three key variables: first, we continue to believe that our Sunbelt footprint maintains an advantageous position for capturing demand, given the stronger and more stable employment markets in the Sunbelt states. We continue to see job growth, positive migration trends, affordable rent-to-income ratios and low resident turnover.  Secondly, MAA's unique diversification across the Sunbelt region, including both large and high-growth secondary markets, provides exposure to a good range of employment sectors and works to help soften some of the pressures surrounding new supply levels in a number of our larger markets. And thirdly, with a rent price point average for our portfolio that appeals to our broad segment of the rental market and it is around 20% below the price point of the mostly high-end new product being delivered, we believe we will capture more stability and top-line performance as leasing conditions normalize in 2023. In the event that we do find ourselves later in the year headed towards a more severe contraction in the economy or a recession, as MAA has consistently demonstrated over the past 20 years, we expect to perform with a lower level of volatility than what generally is seen with more concentrated portfolios and/or those costs traded in large coastal markets. The transaction market remains very quiet and we are likewise remaining patient with what opportunities we do see. I expect it will be the second half of the year before pricing data becomes more readily available. We do have plans to initiate development on four new projects in 2023 associated with sites that we already own or that are under our control. These projects will, of course, not actually start delivering units for another couple of years. In conclusion, I want to give a big thank you to our MAA associates for their tremendous service and record performance in2022.  We have the company well positioned for the next cycle, as a number of new tech initiatives will positively impact performance over the coming years. Our external growth pipeline continues to expand and the balance sheet provides a good, strong foundation for supporting our current portfolio operations, as well as active pursuit of new growth opportunities. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments and I'll turn the call over to Tim.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Same-store performance for the quarter was once again strong and ahead of our expectations. While pricing performance moderated during the fourth quarter from the record growth we had achieved September year-to-date, blended lease-over-lease pricing was up 5.7%. As a result, effective rent growth or the growth on all in-place leases for the fourth quarter was 14.9%, versus the prior year and 2.0% sequentially from the prior quarter. Full year 2022 blended lease-over-lease pricing was 13.9%, helping to drive full year effective rent growth of 14.6%. Alongside the strong pricing performance, average daily occupancy remained steady at 95.6% for the fourth quarter and 95.7% for the full year 2022. In line with normal seasonality, our January new lease rate of negative 0.3% improved from December's new lease rate of negative 0.9% and other than 2022 represents a higher new lease rate than any year since we have been tracking the data. Combined with renewal pricing of 8.6%, January blended lease-over-lease pricing was 4.2% and average daily occupancy was 95.7%. With new lease pricing moderating as expected, renewal pricing, which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022 is providing a catalyst for the strong January pricing and is expected to be strong for the next few months before moderating to a more typical range. We are achieving growth rates on signed renewals of around 8% to 9% for the first quarter. We do expect new supply in several of our markets remain elevated in 2023, putting some pressure on rent growth, but the various demand indicators remain strong and we expect our portfolio to continue to benefit from population household and job growth. As Eric mentioned, should we see a more dramatic downturn in the economy from here, we expect our market's diversification and price point will help mitigate some of the impact to performance. During the quarter, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of smart home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the full year 2022, we completed more than 6,500 interior unit upgrades and installed over 24,000 smart home packages. As of December 31, 2022, the total number of smart units is over 71,000, and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023. For our repositioning program, leases have been fully or partially repriced at the first 11 properties in the program and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on costs averaging approximately 17%.We have another four projects that will begin repricing this quarter and five additional projects currently under construction. Those are all of my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Brad.
Brad Hill: Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Despite execution challenges in the transaction market, our team successfully completed our disposition plan for 2022 by closing our last two dispositions in the fourth quarter. Our total disposition proceeds for the year were approximately $325 million, representing a stabilized NOI yield of 4.3% and an investment IRR of 17.7% for assets with an average age of 25 years old. In 2023, we will continue the discipline of steadily recycling capital out of older, higher CapEx properties with the intent to redeploy the capital into newer, lower CapEx, higher rent growth properties to drive higher long-term earnings growth within our portfolio. While transaction volume continues to be muted, we believe it's likely that the transaction market will provide more opportunities towards the back half of the year. Currently, the number of marketed properties is down substantially from 2022, with the majority of sellers waiting until at least the spring leasing season before reevaluating their planned sale timing. In the face of this lower volume, we have seen some upward pressure on cap rates with the degree of the movement varying based on property characteristics, embedded rent growth, as well as market and submarket location. However, until closed transactions materially increase transparency around cap rates will be difficult. When marketed deal volume does increase, we expect buyer financial strength and speed of execution to be attractive key differentiators and our balance sheet strength and capacity will support our ability to transact despite a more difficult credit environment. On our new developments, our team has done a tremendous job working through the challenges of elevated construction costs and permitting delays, leading to steady growth in our development pipeline. During 2022,we started construction on 1,253 units at a cost of $468 million, a record level of starts for MAA.  During the fourth quarter, we started construction on two projects that have been in predevelopment for some time. These two projects will begin delivering units in two years and should finish construction in three years, lining up well with what we believe is likely to be a strong leasing environment. While the timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and construction bidding processes, we expect to start four new developments during the back half of 2023. This includes two in-house developments, one located in Orlando and one in Denver and two pre-purchased joint venture developments, one located in Charlotte and the other a Phase 2 to our West Midtown development in Atlanta. Our construction management team continues to do a tremendous job actively managing our projects and working with our contractors to keep the inflationary and supply chain pressures from causing a meaningful increase to our overall development costs or our schedules. Despite these headwinds, the team delivered three projects on time in 2022 and under budget by approximately $4.5 million. During the fourth quarter, construction wrapped up on MAA Windmill Hill, and we reached stabilization at MAA Robinson, MAA West Glenn and MAA Park Point with operating results well ahead of our pro forma expectations delivering stabilized NOI yields on average of 6.6%. Leasing demand at our new properties remains high and the competition from other new supply has, to-date, not had a significant impact on our lease-up performance with rents being achieved well ahead of pro formas. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Al.
Albert Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.32 for the quarter was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance and contributed to core FFO for the full year of $8.50 per share, representing a 21% increase over the prior year. Same-store rental pricing and occupancy levels were in line with expectations for the quarter, while higher fee and reimbursement revenues, combined with strong lease-up and commercial revenues, to produce about two-thirds of this earnings outperformance for the quarter. This favorability was partially offset by real estate tax expenses, as final millage rates came in higher than expected during the quarter for several markets, primarily in Texas. Our real estate tax estimates were based on strong valuations supported by the very strong revenue trends over the last year, offset by expected millage rate rollbacks as counties managed overall tax needs and rollbacks occurred but were less than expected in Texas, particularly in Dallas and Austin. Our internal guidance for – our initial guidance, excuse me, for '23, which we'll discuss more in a moment anticipate some continued pressure in this area given its backward-looking nature. Our balance sheet remains very strong, as we ended the year with historically low leverage debt-to-EBITDA RE of3.71 times with 95.5% of our debt fixed at an average interest rate of 3.4% and with $1.3 billion available capacity to support growth and manage our debt maturities late in 2023. Also at the end of January, we settled our outstanding forward equity contracts, providing an additional $204 million of capacity at an attractive cost of capital. We currently expect to fund our near-term acquisition, development and refinancing needs with short-term debt capacity allowing the financing markets to continue to stabilize before locking in long-term financing. Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2023 with our release, which is detailed in the supplemental information package. Core FFO for the year is projected to be $8.88 to $9.28 per share or $9.08 at the midpoint, which represents a 6.8% increase over the prior year. The foundation for the projected 2023 performance is same-store revenue growth produced by historically higher rental pricing earn-in of about 5.5% combined with the more normalized blended rental pricing performance of 3% for the year, as well as a continued strong occupancy remaining between 95.6% and 96%for the year. Based on this, effective rent growth for the year is projected to be a solid 7% at the midpoint of our range, with total same-store revenues expected to grow 6.25%, slightly diluted from the other revenue items, primarily reimbursement in fee income, which grew at a more modest pace. Same-store operating expenses are projected to grow at 6.15% at the midpoint for the year with real estate taxes and insurance producing the most significant growth pressure. Combined these two items alone are expected to grow just over 7% for 2023 with the remaining controllable operating items expected to grow around 5.5%. These expense pressures are offset by the continued strong revenue growth with NOI for the year projected to grow 6.3% at the midpoint. We're also expecting continued external growth, both through the acquisitions and development opportunities during the year with a combined $700 million full year planned investment. This growth will be partially funded by asset sales, providing around $300 million of expected proceeds. We expect to fund the remaining capital needs for the year from internal cash flow and short-term variable rate borrowings, as we anticipate the financing markets to continue stabilizing over the next year, eventually providing better opportunities to lock in long-term debt rates. This does produce some slight pressure on current year FFO performance given high short-term rates, but is expected to be rewarded with lower long-term financing costs when markets stabilize further. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Nikki, we'll now turn the call back to you for any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Nick Yulico: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to start with the guidance on same-store revenue. So if you're at sort of right around 6% at the midpoint, I think you guys had an earn-in that was close to that number coming into the year. So, you have occupancy being roughly flat in the guidance. So just trying to understand kind of what might be the offset as to – and you are assuming some market rent growth, as well. So just trying to understand kind of the buildup there and if there is anything we're missing as to why the revenue growth guidance wouldn't be a little bit higher based on the earnings you've cited?
Albert Campbell: Yes. Nick, I'll give you the components – this is Al. I'll give you the components of how we built it, and maybe Tim can give a little color, if he would like, on some of the components. But really it’s built on the earn-in. You talked about based on where pricing was when we think about earnings is pricing at the end the year if it were to carry-forward that same level, not up or down, what would it be built into our portfolio. That's about5.5%, that's the way we think about it. And on top of that, you get about half of the current year expected blended pricing. And as we talked about, we're expecting about 3%. So you add those two numbers together, you get right at the 7% effective rent growth guidance that we put out. Now that is, as we mentioned in the comments, a little bit moderated from other income items. About 10% of our revenue stream is from reimbursements and fees those things and they're expected to grow more modestly than that. So that's what gets to 6.25%, but in terms of the earn-in and the components, that's really what it is.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just the second question is just to get a feel for what type of economic scenario is baked into guidance whether this is a softer landing with modest job losses, any commentary from you guys on the economic outlook would be helpful? Thanks.
Eric Bolton: Well, Nick, this is Eric. I mean broadly, as Al mentioned, I mean, we do expect that the overall rent growth for the market next year will be something around 3%, which I think is going to be fueled by what we expect to be a continued relatively stable employment backdrop to what we're seeing today. We're not seeing any real evidence, significant evidence building in any of our markets at this point relating to employment weakness or people losing jobs. We're not having any kind of issues surrounding collections. Migration trends continue to be very positive.  And so, as we think about the outlook for '23, I mean, we're – it's definitely moderated from what it was 2022, but we're not seeing any concerns at the moment that a severe contraction or any sort of a worse – a materially worse decline in the employment markets were to occur now. If that does happen is, as I alluded to in my comments, we've been through recessions in the past, and we think that if we find ourselves in a more severe economic contraction, where broadly the employment markets start to really pull back, we think that that's where the sort of defensive characteristics that we've built into our strategy really start to pay a dividend for us and that's where our secondary markets come into play on lower price point of our product comes into play and the broad diversification to employment sectors that we have across the large number of markets that we're in, all provide some level of cushion, if you will, if we find ourselves in a more severe downturn. So right now, we're not calling for that, but we think that it should have happen, we would probably weather that pressure better than a lot of others.
Nick Yulico: Thanks, Eric.
Operator: We will take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning. Just, first question is on development and your appetite for using capital. You said that cap rates overall for stabilized products are still sort of in flux. The debt market is clearly better for apartments, but CMBS, which you guys don't use or Fannie, Freddie, whatever, that's still – well, I guess, more CMBS remains sort of closed.  So as you guys think about development, do you think more about starting on your own account or do you see the potential that you're better off buying from other people who may run into financial difficulty, where on a risk-adjusted, you're better off to pick from someone else rather than starting ground up from you guys?
Brad Hill: Yes, Alex, this is Brad. I'll start off with that. I'd say it's both. We're looking at both opportunities, both on our balance sheet and then working with partners, as well. I mean what we haven't seen broadly yet are developers kind of spitting sites, spitting land sites. We've seen it a little bit, but it's been sites that we're not really interested in. We've not seen the well located sites that have gone under contract kind of being let go, we've not seen that yet. So we will keep our eye on that for sure, because I think that's where the opportunity presents itself for our on-balance sheet developments where we can pick up some of those land sites that other people drop. I think what we are seeing short term is exactly what you mentioned is the difficulties in the debt market kind of showing up through some of our development partners, maybe they can't get the debt financing for some of their developments going or equity partners backing out on deals. We are seeing that short term. We've got a team of folks this week that are out at NMHC and we've already got a number of e-mails of projects, JV development opportunities that are a follow-up from that, where their shovel-ready, could start mid-year.  So we'll begin evaluating those because I think those are the ones that are going to be impacted by the debt market and just how tight that is right now. But the long story is, we'll look for opportunities in both of those areas.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And the second question is just going back to Nick's question on sort of state of the markets and the employment. One of the common refrains about the Sunbelt is, it always has a lot of supply, but the economic growth seems to be more than offset and you spoke about that relative to your ability to manage higher taxes, higher insurance. As you look at this year, and based on what your property managers see among the resident base and employment stats within your markets, do you see any like substantial risk that employment or economic job growth in your markets will not be able to exceed the new supply coming on? Or as you sit here today, your – as you guys sit around the round table, you're like, there are a few more markets that we're more concerned about now than we were back in, let's say, November, when you guys were assessing how 2023 would look?
Eric Bolton: Well, Alex, this is Eric. As we sit here today, we continue to feel good about the demand side of the equation for us. As I mentioned, we're not seeing any – I mean, the lead volume and traffic that we're seeing is still strong. We are seeing – not seeing any evidence of stress with our renters in terms of collections.  We're not seeing any evidence of people coming in, talking about losing their job because of – and needing to get out their lease. We're not seeing any roommating trends starting to pick up. And so, as we sit here – and then also, you look at the migration trends, we still saw 12% of the leases that we did in the fourth quarter were for people moving into the Sunbelt from outside of Sunbelt.  So, we are still not seeing any worries build on the demand side of the equation at this point, moderating from what it was but still quite strong.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you. All good. Thank you.
Eric Bolton: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks guys. I was just curious if you could share how – I believe the 3% figure you provided on lease-over-leases, the blended lease rate growth assumption embedded in guidance. And I'm just wondering if you could breakdown that between sort of the first half assumption and back half, as you alluded to, kind of renewals maybe trending a little bit lower as the year progresses?
Tim Argo: Hey, Austin, this is Tim. Yes, you heard me mention in the comments that renewals right now are the catalyst for us and kind of carrying the strength, new lease pricing outpace renewals for the bulk of 2022. So we knew we kind of had some runway on the renewal side that's carrying us through this early part of 2023. So, the 8% to 9% I talked about on renewals, I think that probably carries through the first quarter, call it, and then starts to moderate a little bit as you get into probably, June through the rest of the year, I would expect it to be a little more normal with sort of what you've typically seen from MAA, which is kind of in that 6% to 7% range and then on the new lease side, we're sitting slightly negative right now.  I think that will slowly accelerate through the spring and summer and go modestly positive and then trend back down towards the end of the year. So, kind of higher renewals in the first half of the year, moderating a little bit, new lease rates growing slightly through the year and then moderating just with seasonality, as we typically would see in Q4 and then you kind of blend that all together and get to the forecast that we have for blended lease-over-lease.
Austin Wurschmidt: Well, on the new lease rate side, I guess what specifically – I mean it seems like that's fairly low relative to what you've achieved historically, pre-pandemic period and with 3% market rent growth, you would think that you kind of surpass that 3% into the peak leasing season before it moderates in the back half of the year. So, I guess I'm trying to understand that kind of cautious new lease rate growth assumption in your guidance? And then, could you also just share what would get you to the low end of the guidance range because that seems like a pretty draconian scenario to be able to achieve the lower end? Thanks.
Albert Campbell: I'll give you sort of the forecast how it's laid out quarter by quarter, and Tim will give a little more specifics on it. It is fairly consistent around that 3% for the year with obviously more -- a little higher in the second two quarters of the year, as Tim mentioned, as we get more traffic and renewals hold stronger and new lease pricing becomes most robust. It's really going to come down to new lease pricing as the variable through the year. But the band is fairly tight around 3% in our expectation, just given the blend of over overall demand. And so...
Tim Argo: Yes, following up on the new lease rate, I mean, we again, absent last year that was record highs, new lease rates kind of November-December, early part of the first quarter, typically are negative. So it's not unusual kind of the new lease rates that we're seeing right now and then they start to accelerate as we get into the spring and summer. But in terms of getting to low end, I think it's kind of back to Eric's comments on the economy, if we see a further deceleration in demand or see something a shock on the economic front that could drive pricing obviously lower and that's how you get towards the lower end of the guidance and then the opposite a little bit better economic backdrop would push pricing higher and get us more to the higher end of revenue guidance.
Albert Campbell: If That shot came, it would -- given that it's coming -- the impact will come through pricing, it would be manifest probably in the latter part of the year as those new leases blended in.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Got it. That’s helpful. Thanks everybody.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead. 
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Eric, in your comments on the stuff, you talked about the strong balance sheet and have been in a position to capture any growth opportunities. It sounds like you think may emerge from your comments on the call, it sounds like maybe that's more of a second half '23 comment. But where do you think there's opportunities could come from? Is that more acquisitions, land, something else?
Eric Bolton: No, Nick, I would tell you that my belief is that we've been through this in the past, where we tend to find the best opportunity is in projects that are in lease-up, fairly newly constructed. There are more not have already finished the construction. They may be at that 50%-60% occupancy level in their initial lease-up. They've been leasing for probably the better part of the year. So they're still – they are now getting to a point where they're starting to run into lease expirations and related turnover, which just brings that much more pressure on the lease-up effort itself. And these, as I say, are not yet fully stabilized assets and thus, they're more difficult to finance from a typical leverage buyer so that's where we're hopeful that we will find more emerging opportunities in that kind of a scenario. We've certainly seen that in the past. And one of the things I think is important to point out, I mean, our assumptions is built around – for 2023, our guidance is built around the assumption of a $400 million acquisition volume. Now we are assuming that their initial yield on this $400 million of acquisition is only 3%, reflecting that non-stabilized status of these investments, so while that is weighing on FFO performance for the year, we think that it has great value proposition, value opportunity going forward long term. And so we're – given the supply that's coming into the market, given the difficult financing environment we find ourselves in, we think that, that area of opportunity is going to emerge over the course of this year, and that's what we've kind of dialed into our guidance for the year.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. That's very helpful. And then, I guess, we've spent a lot of time on kind of macro backdrop and the blended rent growth assumption and everything that goes into revenue. But if you think about from a market perspective in '23, given your kind of new guidance, what does that imply for which markets are kind of the top performers and which you're concerned about? 
Tim Argo: Yes, Nick, this is Tim. I mean with the earned in, we talked about of our larger markets, I expect just rent growth or revenue growth should be pretty solid for several of our markets due to that earn-in. But if you think about some of the stronger ones that we think will continue into 2023, I mean, Orlando, continues to be a really strong market for us. It's been strong now for a couple of years. In terms of demand, it's our #1 job growth market that we're expecting for 2023. It is getting a little bit of supply, but it's not necessarily situated where our portfolio is in Orlando of some markets in our portfolio that are getting the most supply only one of those is in Orlando. So the demand, combined with the supply there expects Orlando to be strong. It's continued to have really strong blended pricing both in Q4 and January. And then Dallas is another one I'd point out that we think can show some strength in 2023. It's one of our lower supply markets we would expect. There is a couple submarkets that we're in, particularly in North Dallas, Frisco, Plano Allen, that will get some supply. But broadly, Dallas hasn't seen as much supply pressure, and we've seen the pricing both in Q4 and January been a little bit higher than portfolio average. So those are a couple that we've kind of got our eye on from a strength standpoint. Austin is probably one that on the downside that we're keeping our eye on more than anything. It's kind of got the extremes on supply and demand.  It's one of the better indicators in terms of demand with job growth, migration, population, all that, but it also has absolute high supply coming into the market of any of our portfolios or any of the markets in our portfolio out of the various submarkets that we're seeing supply, 4 out of the top 20 are in Austin. So that's one we do expect to moderate, though it does have pretty good earned in rate growth. So, those area couple that we're kind of keeping our eye on.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. That's helpful. So it sounds like maybe the large still outperformed the secondary markets in '23 or maybe that spread narrows a bit?
Tim Argo: Yes, it probably narrows a bit just with moderating rent growth. We typically see the secondary markets holdup a little more if we get into softer economic environment. But I think broadly in terms of revenue growth, again, with the earn-in, I would expect that the large markets hold up pretty well.
Nick Joseph: Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead. 
Anthony Powell: Hi, good morning. Thanks. Just a question on new lease spreads and pricing going into the spring. What would cause you to get a bit more, I guess, confident on pushing rate more as you get to the peak leasing season, would it be just general improvement and economic sentiment, job to be where it is, the market continuing to do well? Just curious how you may change your approach to pricing in spring if things get a bit better?
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean, generally, it's going to be – it will be that. It's the economy and the demand, and we look at lead volume, we look at exposure, we look at rent to income and various things there that drives some of our decisions on – we are always sort of balancing how much we want to push price versus occupancy. So there's nothing – there is no blinking red lights right now that would suggest that we see any sort of downturn. We're kind of we're kind of monitoring all those various metrics right now and everything looks about what you would typically think during this time of the year, during the winter. So it will really be as we get into spring and summer as demand picks up and traffic pick up and we pick up that will be really the determining factor on where 2023 heads in terms of demand.
Anthony Powell: Okay, thanks. And turnover seemed pretty consistent. And any changes in how certain residents responded to lease renewals, price increases? And any trends there you want to call out?
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean the turnover was – remains pretty low. Historically speaking, it was up a little bit in Q4, but the reasons for turn have been pretty consistent. We've actually seen the move-out to rent increase decline a little bit, but it's still – it's a job transfer and buy a house are still the two biggest factors, but those have certainly been down from what we've seen in the past. But no notable trends one way or the other.
Anthony Powell: Right. Thank you.
Operator: We'll move next with Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
Chandni Luthra: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Could you spend some time talking about the expense outlook for 2023, what would get you to the low end versus the high end? And guidance does talk about property taxes in there, but perhaps you could spend some time on other elements? And then, what are the markets where you see more tax pressures versus others? Thank you.
Albert Campbell: Chandni, this is Al. I'll start with that and then maybe Tim can give some color on some of that. I think the way to think about that as you go into 2023 is, we're continuing to see general inflationary pressures a bit in our expenses, but really taxes and insurance are the drivers of the main pressure. And as I mentioned in my comments, those two together are over 7% and so that's really -- and taxes are 35% of all operating expenses. So it's very meaningful. And then the other expenses together are about 5.5%. I think we're beginning to see some moderation in personnel, repair maintenance and those things. And I think you'll see that manifest, and Tim can talk about components of it, but as we move more into the back of the year, you'll see a little more of that manifest in those loan items. But taxes and insurance, there's a pressure point. What could take us higher or lower to our guidance on the overall, which is primarily going to be taxes and insurance, would be we don't have a lot of information yet on either 1 of those. Taxes, when you go into the year, notoriously, you don't have a lot, you're going off -- you have a good idea what you think valuations will be based on cap rate markets, but you're totally guessing on millage rates, and that has been very volatile in the last year-or-so as municipalities deal with their budget issues. So we think we – and we've got a few fights left over from last year. I mean we've got some things that we're going to fight hard, and we continue to. In Texas, we'll formally litigate half of our properties this year than we did last year, and some of those have not yet finished. And so – there are things like that, that can make you go higher or lower. We feel like we've got our best estimate in there right now, and that's the appropriate thing to do. And so overall, we'll see some moderation in the controllable expenses, but expense pressure driven by insurance and taxes.
Tim Argo: Yes, Chandni, I'll add to that. As Al mentioned, about 40% of our expenses are taxed at insurance, call it, around 7%. And then the other 60% around 5.5%. So if I had to just thinking in terms of absolute year-over-year growth, I sort of rank them, I would say insurance is probably the highest, R&M probably the second highest in real estate tax is the third. So hitting on R&M, it's really driven by inflationary pressures, not so much we expect to get really any worse in 2023 that kind of carry over earn-in, if you will, on some of the inflationary increases that we saw in 2022,we've seen HVAC up 16%, plumbing up 18%, appliances up 17%. So that's expected to drive the pressure on the R&M side, but we still remain on a per unit basis lower than the sector average. I do think personnel moderates from what we saw in 2022. I think we have some opportunity there. But -- and then the other smaller line items are fairly manageable. So it's really on a controllable, if you will, side it's R&M, we think is driving the bulk of the increase.
Chandni Luthra: Thank you for all that details. For my follow-up question, I just wanted to clarify or trying to understand how are you thinking about bad debt in 2023? What's embedded in your guidance if there is anything and how does that compare versus 2022? And then as you've obviously talked about supply being higher in 2023, how are you thinking about concessions? Are you seeing more concessions in your markets, in your properties? Any thoughts around that would be very helpful. Thank you. 
Brad Hill: I'll start with the bad debt. I mean I think in terms of what we have in our guidance, collection practices have come pretty much back to normal, not 100% maybe, but very close, I would say. something to say about that. But collections are very good. What we dialed in as close to historic normal, call it, 40 to 50 basis points delinquency, which is very low. And we have almost no collections coming from any government programs. We have the amount of our uncollected from history as it continues to decline. So we're in a very good position there. And so our forecast for the year reflects that. And so moderating or normalizing trends that we're putting our forecast really has collections about where they typically are in a normal environment.
Tim Argo: Yes. And, one, I'll add on the concession point, we're not seeing any significant increase in concessions at this point. It was 0.3% of rents overall in Q4, which is in line with what we saw in Q3. We are -- to the extent we're seeing them, it's still largely across the portfolio, more in some of the urban or downtown submarkets, which has seen more of the supply and seeing less concession usage on more suburban assets. But generally, no big change from what we've seen in the last couple of quarters. .
Chandni Luthra: Thank you for that. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. 
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning out there. Few questions from me on the external growth front. I was at National Multi-Housing, too, but heard that there is a – that buyers more institutional demand, but a shortage of sellers and products. But I guess I am curious if you would see an advantage to a selling more assets now is that perhaps the premium and perhaps be willing to sell a bit earlier in the year to capitalize on even if it doesn't mean to put a dilution as the way to redeploy in a more favorable acquisition market in the back half of the year? 
Brad Hill: Yes. Haendel, this is Brad. I'll take that. As we entered this year, our disposition plan is really big component of that, as you mentioned, is the ability to redeploy that capital. That's a big part of what we're looking to do. And so we're not looking to time the market. We do a very in-depth review of our disposition plans in the third, fourth quarter of the year to really identify what we're going to sell for the year. And we generally don't factor in what we think are going to be the market dynamics in terms of just maximizing value. We want to do that. But broadly speaking, what we're trying to do is really build a long-term earnings within the company that really supports our ability to pay a growing dividend over time. And so we think that's better done on a consistent basis where we're in a position to be able to sell assets, maximize our proceeds to the best we can and then redeploy that capital into external growth opportunities. So what we have in our forecast right now is a sale of 1 asset earlier in the year. And the reason for that is we're targeting a strong primary market that's in Charlotte where we think we can kind of maximize the proceeds given the fact that there aren't a lot of sellers out there right now in that specific market. And then we'll come out with our other assets later in the year when we think the debt markets will be a little bit settled down a little bit, spreads will be a little bit less volatile than where they are right now and frankly, where buyers can get a little bit more visibility on values. We think that that's the best direction for us in terms of our dispositions and our external growth plan.
Haendel St. Juste: That's very helpful. I appreciate the color there. A follow-up maybe on the different side, but external growth related. We've seen a lot of mid and high four cap rate trades of late, but hearing the bid-ask spread that remains fairly wide, 10-ish from some folks, so curious kind of what you're hearing or seeing on the bid-ask spread? And how this plays out? What do you think the market clearing price is or what you'd be willing to pay to get some deals done here? Thanks.
Brad Hill: Yes. It's hard to say. I mean there is just, as we looked at the market in the fourth quarter, honestly, in terms of the assets that we would be interested in buying and track, there was really only seven. So in the universe of us normally tracking 40 deals in a quarter to only have seven transact is a very, very small universe and we have seen cap rates move up. I would say, in the third quarter, they're around 4.5 on the projects that we looked at. In the fourth quarter, they were 4.75. We – but there is a spread, obviously, and it really depends on where the assets are located. We saw one in the fourth quarter that traded, call it, for 5.25, but generally, when you're getting into that cap rate range right now, we found that the quality of the asset or the location is not ideal and it's not generally a location that we're interested in. So for assets we're interested in, they're still in the 4.75 range. To your earlier point, I think part of the driver there is that there's just not a lot on the market. And I think as more volume to come to market, which we think will happen late second quarter and into the third quarter later this year, even as more properties come to market that those cap rates likely expand a bit. I mean the fact is interest rates are up substantially. Today, the debt rates are 5 to 5.5 and that's got to push cap rates up at some point, negative leverage is not something that we can maintain in perpetuity. But until you have a significant volume of assets coming to market, there's still going to be a number of aggressive buyers out there that are bidding hard at assets that are really setting a lower cap rate range. And then I would also say that a majority of what's selling right now continues to be loan assumptions. And so that kind of masks what true cap rates are out in the market, and we just need volume to really help us see that.
Haendel St. Juste: That's really helpful, too, appreciate that. If I could squeeze in one more. I don't think I heard it, but did you guys share or can you share what your turnover assumption is for a full year '23? Thanks.
Tim Argo: Yes, Haendel, this is Tim. For now, we're expecting it to be pretty similar. I think some of the reasons that drove turnover this year probably moderate a little bit and maybe some of the other reasons go up a little bit. But in general, we're expecting similar turnover to what we saw in 2022. .
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Thanks. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead. 
Richard Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the expected deceleration of rent growth, obviously, in 2023, no one is surprised by that. But I'm wondering if you can sort of get into some more of the nitty-gritty detail of where you're landing, how much of it is proactive on your part? How much of is it reactive? Are you sensing fatigue from customers? Are you noticing occupancy moving around or turnover? I think you mentioned – Tim, I think you mentioned turnover uptick in the fourth quarter. Are there any things that you're reacting to that's causing you to pinpoint where you're headed for same-store revenue growth in 2023? Or are you just sort of protecting the downside given some of the uncertainty in the macro environment and being more proactive in your approach? 
Eric Bolton: Well, Rich, this is Eric. Let me try to answer that. I think that at the ground level, I would say that we're not really seeing anything at this point that causes us to believe that we're looking at a much weaker demand environment over the coming year. I mean as I touched on earlier, I mean we're still seeing no evidence of distress with our vendor base. Our rent-to-income ratios remain very stable relative to where they have been. Collections performance has been very strong. We're not seeing any behavioral changes with roommating, things of that nature. We're not in the trends to migrate – migration trends continue to be quite positive. Move outs to non-MAA markets and our move outs out of the Sunbelt continue to be quite low. So I think more than anything for us, we're just trying to keep an eye on the broader economy and the broader employment markets and any evidence that the employers are really starting to get aggressive at downscaling and downsizing their staffing. And we've not seen that yet, but that would be obviously a cause for concern. But at a macro level, move-outs to home buying continues to be quite low, and there's no evidence mounting that that's starting to change and move outs due to the people not wanting to pay their rent increase that we're asking for, still is our third biggest reason. But we're still having people come in after them when they do move out, willing to pay more than what we were asking the renewing resident to pay. So that's a – that to me, is a fairly strong indicator that the market is still holding up quite well. And so, I think we're just – we're moderating off of incredible highs and that's what's happening here. But in terms of any significant pullback in demand, we are just not seeing that at this point.
Richard Anderson: Okay. Fair enough. Second question is, just closing the loop on the supply conversation, what always happens is developers chasing 2022 growth by delivering product in 2024. Always a smart strategy. But I guess my question is, do you feel like the environment and interest rates and everything else, do you feel like sort of the private developer model is on shaker ground than normal this time around? And perhaps even more of an opportunity for you to step in at some point down the road? Or is it sort of a typical environment, different, obviously, variables, but a typical opportunity for you a year or two down the road?
Brad Hill: Rich, this is Brad. I definitely think in terms of new starts, they're on much shaker ground, the privates are, for sure, in terms of getting financing. I would say that anything that is in lease-up right now. I mean there's not distress in that market currently. So there's not a lot of forced selling at the moment. Now there are still equity and capital folks that they want to cycle out of.  As I mentioned earlier, our region is predominantly controlled or developed by merchant developers and they're really – their model is built on developing an asset and selling it, taking the profit, moving on to the next deal and rinsing and repeating. I'd say that's a little bit in flux right now with nothing selling and the inability to start new assets. I would say the private developer is a little bit more in flux right now because of those reasons.
Richard Anderson: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead. 
Wesley Golladay: Hey, good morning, everyone. Last year, you had about just under $200 million of nonrecurring CapEx, how are you thinking about the spend for this year and is there anything in there that would drive down expenses maybe in 2023 or 2024?
Albert Campbell: Wes, this is Al. I'll start and frame the capital. I mean overall, we're spending -- all the programs to get her probably around $300 million in recurring and enhancing together probably $180 million. And so that's about$1,800 a unit, probably $1,000 recurring a little more and the rest being rent-enhancing. We continue our programs in redevelopment program, which includes our smart grant. So we'll do those interior programs that's another $97 million and we'll continue our property repositioning program with Tim talks about taking properties and increasing their revenue potential of another $20 million or so. So overall, it's about $300 million. I mean certainly, there's some There's certainly some things in the revenue has we think whether there'll be some ESG investments or some things like that, that will have some potential for the future. We're also seeing some inflationary pressures in that as well. And then a large portion of that fee is just investment for the future in some of those programs, repositioning program, redevelopment and smart rents. So that's kind of how we think about that.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. And then I guess as we maybe fast forward for the next few years, does this ever start to ramp down or do you have just a big pipeline of when the smart rent is done, you just move on to something else? How should we think about a multiyear view on this?
Tim Argo: Yes. Wes, this is Tim. I mean, in total, I think it comes down a little bit. The Smart Brent installation is a fairly significant piece of that. we expect to finish that capital project this year. I think you'll see that come down. But I would expect both on the unit interior redevelopment program and the broader sort of amenity-based property repositioning program that we expect to continue those at similar levels.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. And then did you comment on the exposure right now? I might have missed it?
Tim Argo: Exposure right now sit at about 7.5%, which is in line with what it was last year and kind of what we would typically expect this time of the year. .
Wesley Golladay: Okay. Thanks a lot, everyone.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead. 
Robert Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Brad, what are the markets represented by the four to six development starts over the next year plus? And given Tim's comments on R&M pressures, what are you seeing in terms of construction cost pressures going forward for new starts?
Brad Hill: Yes, Rob. So for the four starts that we feel we're in good shape on for this year. We've got one in Charlotte, we've got one in Denver, we've got one in Orlando and one in Atlanta. I think I had those in my prepared comments. So those are projects we've been working on for a while and plans are in process on those. So we feel pretty good about those. In addition to those projects, we own a number of sites and we've got some in Denver, another phase in Orlando.  Second phase in the Raleigh market. So a number of those projects that would add up to that six over the next 18 months or so. But for this year, the 4 are the ones that I mentioned in my comments. In terms of construction costs, what we're seeing right now is that costs are not escalating like they were in 2022. We saw a significant increase in construction costs throughout the year. At this point, we're not seeing that at the moment. It's certainly our hope that as we get further into this year, the times where our developments will be starting second or third and fourth quarter that perhaps we get some relief there. The first signs of that are that we're getting calls from contractors saying they didn't think they had capacity to bid our job originally, but now they do. We're hearing that from subcontractors as well. So given where the single-family market is and the fact that we expect new supply starts to come down on multifamily, we hope to see some relief on the construction side but for now, it's just holding flat.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then, Al, G&A was 58.8 in '22 and the guidance is 55.5 at the midpoint for '23. Obviously, Tom's left, but what else is in that expected decrease?
Albert Campbell: I think that's, well, let me start with Rob, as we talked about, we really look at overhead as a total. And so I would focus more on the 128.5 and then that's over 3% growth in total for the year, which we think is rise. But on that specific G&A line, the biggest item there is we had very strong performance in 2022.  So you've got certain programs that performance incentive programs that are max and then we said our guidance for next year is based on target. So that's a big part of that. And then on the property management expense line, the growth in that, that you see is really investments in, primarily in technology, both to strengthen our platform and to support the initiatives that were going on. So, and I answered both of those because I think that's both together a part of that overall overhead growth for the year, Rob.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Good morning. thanks for taking my question. What's the expected expense growth cadence during the year? Is that relatively flat or is that accelerating? And within that are you have a midyear renewal or insurance but easier compares in the back half, how does that reconcile? And then on real estate taxes, the midpoint of the guidance is 6.25%, but that would be lower than 6.5% last year.  So, just trying to understand the shape of the expenses through the year and also why the real estate taxes would be perhaps slightly down this year?
Albert Campbell: Okay. I'll try to answer that. This is Al. I think what you – the cadence for expenses, you should see the most pressure in probably Q1 and that's because you've got a continuation of sort of the inflationary levels that we saw in third and fourth quarter carrying sequentially over and comparing to Q1 last year with a lot of inflationary pressure wasn't yet built in. So the highest point would probably be Q1 and it will moderate down Q2 and Q3 to more level more that mid-single-digit range. So that's the main thing. In taxes, the 6.25%, I think we are – last year, what we saw in 2022 was looking back to a strong year, we saw millage rates come in that we thought would roll back more than they did. It surprised us a little bit in the fourth quarter as we talked about. And so that was – we ended the year a little higher than we expected in 2022. And I think as we move in 2023, we don't expect significant reprising key areas. Our – we got a pretty – we have a pretty good beat on what's revaluing this year, it's primarily Texas and part of Atlanta, parts of Georgia, there's primarily Atlanta, and so given what's revaluing and our expectations for millage rates, and we have a few of our cases from 2022 that we're litigating that are spilling over into 2023. And so we've got an estimate of what we think we'll win on that. We may be wrong, but we've got an estimate on that, included in that. So all that together gets us that that 6.25% range. And a lot of unknown in that right now, as we talked about, but we think where we stand, that's a very good estimate.
Michael Goldsmith: Got it. And sticking with you, Al. NOI growth has been strong, but property values haven't had the same magnitude of increase due to the rise in cap rate. So does that leave more opportunity for successful appeals maybe in '24 and beyond? Thanks.
Albert Campbell: Yeah, I think what we'd say is '23 is a year just that they're still looking back at very strong revenue. It's kind of backward-looking game, looking at the beginning of this year. Still looking at strong revenues for 2022 and a pretty stable cap rate environment has changed, but it's still fairly stable. So that's driving it. I do think your point, I think, is a very good point.  As we move into 2024 that they're looking back in a more normalized year, we would expect some moderation in taxes, primarily in Texas, Georgia, and Florida. We're seeing that in most pressure because there – it's going to be driven by a normalized top line to your point. So we would agree with that comment.
Michael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in ‘23
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead. 
John Pawlowski: Hey, thanks for keeping the call going. Al, maybe just a few quick follow-ups on the property tax conversation. Could you just give me a rough sense what percentage of the portfolio you already have a high degree of visibility for the increases this year?
Albert Campbell: Man, it's – what we have a high degree of visibility is pretty low other than we have a good beat on what we think the values are. Obviously, we know given the current cap rate environment is what they are. . And John, I mean, 70% to 75% of our tax exposure is from Texas, Florida and Georgia. So it's really going to come down to the millage rates. It's going to turn down to what municipalities need? What are they going to –we expect to have continued strong valuations and probably millage rates rolling back again. Where that all ends up? It's hard to have precise visibility at this point. I mean I think we have consultants that help us. We have a lot of market knowledge. So it's based on – our estimates based on Texas Georgia and Florida, the key drivers of our expense. And that's – I wish we had more at this point, but I do think that our experience our history in the markets, our consultants give us a pretty good understanding at this point, as good as we can have until second quarter, John, we'll have more third quarter, we'll have not perfect, but very good knowledge, I would say.
John Pawlowski: Okay and I understand there's a range around all the estimates. But just curious, A1, what do you think a reasonable worst-case scenario is for property taxes this year?
Albert Campbell: That's kind of why we've been a little higher – I am sorry yes, that's a good question. That's why we put a little bit higher range or a wider range on that, John. You saw that we put seven at the top end of our – I think that's what we would say. I mean we're 6.25, it could go – you could have some things go either way. We're hopeful that we have some strong fights in these areas, but I think seven would be several things going against us that we didn't expect.
John Pawlowski: Is 8, 9, 10, 0 probability if cities don't lower millage rates...
Albert Campbell: I mean 8, 9 or 10. I mean, given what's revaluing and given the shape of where things are, I think 8, 9, 10 is probably low probability I do think 0 too low end is low probably, I mean the we're looking back again to a very strong 2022. I'm going to use that to put a cap rate on. And so I think it's hard to see much reduction in expectation this year. But as we mentioned, John, as you move into 2024, it would be hard to not be able to argue that some of those because so we would expect what moderation that we see at the beginning 2024.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for keeping the call going. Just a broader general question about the regulatory backdrop. Again, I apologize if this has been asked, but again, just a lot of talk in several municipalities around additional rent control, even at the federal level you have the White House putting out guidelines. Just curious, your overall thoughts on this particular actually have any impact in the short, medium or long term. But if you kind of think maybe a lot of the suggestions are just things that may not impact you at all because it's all about just reading out the bad players in the industry?
Robert Del Priore: Tayo, this is Rob. I'll take a shot at answering that. I think really like if you start at the federal level and the White House blueprint that they put out a couple of weeks ago, it really does seem to focus a lot on – more on the affordable housing component of it. And really almost using the agencies as part of the leverage there, as we look at our states in which we operate and the municipalities, there is some rent control pressure or proposals that come up from time to time, but really don't ever see them gain any traction.  So from a kind of a short, medium term, we don't really see anything as we're tracking legislation across the board that gives us any significant concern and still view it as really if affordable housing is the end goal, it's more of a supply-driven pressure that needs to be added to the system rather than focusing on rent control, which ultimately is a negative for both the owners and the residents.
Omotayo Okusanya: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: We will move next with Jamie Feldman of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you. I guess just a follow-up on question, I mean, do you, in any way, include handicap any kind of rent control risk in your guidance or your rent outlook?
Robert DelPriore: We have not.
Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then, I appreciate all the color on so far in kind of markets. It sounds like things are still going pretty well. But I guess if you focus specifically on like Austin, Nashville, Raleigh, some of these big tech growth markets in recent years and probably market have more layoffs than others.  Can you provide any kind of anecdotal evidence of anything changing there, whether it's different types of people backfilling vacancies or move-outs or anything like that, just those kind of markets versus the rest of the portfolio would be helpful? Thank you.
Tim Argo: Hey, Jamie, this is Tim. I mean I think the ones you point out are right in terms of Austin, Nashville, Raleigh are the ones where we would have more tech exposure than some of the others. But as of now, we haven't seen it. I mean we're keeping an eye on what it exactly means in terms of which staff are going to be impacted by some of the announcements that have already been made, but to date, we haven't seen any impact from that.  No trends different in those markets other than sort of the broader we talked about Austin with broader supply/demand concerns, but we haven't seen anything yet, but those are the ones we would be keeping an eye on, for sure.
Jamie Feldman : Okay. Are you seeing slower demand from those types of employees, people in those industries?
Tim Argo: Not really. I mean, a lot of these markets aren't quite the Silicon Valley in terms of the types of employment that we had there. It's a little more call it, mid-level or if you want to say more a little more blue-collar-type tech, but we've not seen it yet. Like I said, it's some we're keeping an eye on, and that could be what drives more of the downside risk on our forecast for 2023, but nothing reportable so far.
Jamie Feldman : Okay. All right. Thank you. 
Operator: We have no further questions. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: Okay. Well, we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. If you have any other thoughts or questions follow up, just reach out at any point. So, thank you for joining us.
Operator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MAA Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, October 27th, 2022. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.
Andrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Riesa, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, Tom Grimes, and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34x filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and audio recording of this call will be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Andrew and good morning. MAA posted solid results for the third quarter as strong demand for apartment housing across our portfolio drove a 16% increase in leasing traffic volume as compared to last year's third quarter. Higher leasing traffic supported continued solid occupancy and rent growth as was detailed in our earnings release. While as expected, we are seeing a return to more normal seasonal leasing patterns with slower leasing velocity that is typical during the coming holiday season, it's clear that leasing conditions have held up stronger than expected over the back half of this year, and we are carrying solid momentum into calendar year 2023. We will have more details to share about our expectations for next year when we provide earnings guidance for 2023 as part of our fourth quarter earnings release. But absent a severe recession taking place with the resulting weakness in the employment markets, we expect the demand for apartment housing across our portfolio to continue to be strong. At this point, we've not seen any evidence of weakness in the drivers of demand for apartment housing as it applies to our Sunbelt portfolio. Of the leases written in the third quarter, 15% of our new residents were relocating to the Sunbelt from coastal markets. This is comparable to the trends we saw last year. It's also worth noting that the move-outs we had in the third quarter, only 5% were moving out of the Sunbelt. This is also consistent with last year's trends. As noted earlier, leasing traffic is high and resident turnover or move-outs remain well below long-term trends. And importantly, we are seeing no signs of stress in terms of affordability with rent-to-income ratios on the leases completed in Q3, remaining consistent to Q3 of last year in the 22% range and resident payment practices remaining very strong with over 99% of bills rent being collected. As detailed in the earnings release, we are nearing full completion on several of our new development projects, and we have recently started construction on a new property located in Tampa, Florida. In addition, we expect to start construction during the fourth quarter on a new property located in the Research Triangle Park in Raleigh, North Carolina. During the third quarter, we also closed on two acquisitions where we had initiated negotiations and due diligence earlier in the year. The transaction market has become increasingly choppy as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty have presented more challenges. And as a result, seller activity has slowed. We are actively monitoring conditions, but are not currently under contract at the moment with any additional acquisitions. Before turning the call over to Tim to recap more details associated with our property operations, I did want to acknowledge the retirement that -- the announcement that we made last week concerning the planned retirement of Tom Grimes, who has been with our company for the past 28 years. Tom has been a large part -- played a large part of supporting MAA as long and established record of strong performance and steady growth. I'm grateful for Tom's contributions to our company, and we all wish him well. As outlined in last week's release, we have a strong team of leaders at our company with extensive experience, expertise and a record of strong performance we are well-positioned for continued progress as we move forward into 2023. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I will now turn the call over to Tim.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Eric and good morning everyone. Same-store performance for the quarter was once again strong and ahead of our expectations. We saw broad-based strength and pricing performance across the portfolio. During the third quarter, with blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved up 13.9%. As a result, effective rent growth or the growth on all in-place leases for the third quarter was 16.7% versus the prior year and 5.6% sequentially from the prior quarter. Based on our forecast for in-place rents at the end of 2022, we expect our earned in or baked in rent growth for 2023 to be in the 6% range before considering any new rent growth that may occur in 2023. Alongside the robust pricing performance, average daily occupancy for the quarter remained strong at 95.8%. We have continued to achieve pricing better than our previous expectations in the early part of the fourth quarter with blended lease-over-lease pricing for October to date at a very seasonally strong 8.3%. Average physical occupancy for October to date is in line with expectations at 95.7%. Additionally, on average, we are achieving growth rates on signed renewals of around 10% for the fourth quarter. Despite projections that supply will likely remain elevated in 2023, that we think at similar levels to 2022, various demand indicators remain strong and we expect our region of the country to continue to benefit from population, household and job growth. During the quarter, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program and our installation of smart home technology that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and door locks as well as leak detection monitoring. In addition, our broader amenity based and more extensive property repositioning program continues to make great progress. The value to residents provided by these programs can be particularly impactful when new supply is being delivered into the market. On average, we are seeing new development being delivered in our markets with monthly rents that are $350 or about 22% higher than the average rent of our current portfolio. This helps drive the value opportunity associated with our repositioning programs. For the third quarter, we completed 2,305 interior unit upgrades and installed 652 smart home packages. In 2022, we plan to complete over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and approximately 23,000 smart home packages. By the end of the year, we expect our total number of smart units to approach 70,000. For our repositioning program, leases have been repriced at the first eight properties in the program that are now complete, and the results have exceeded our expectations. We have another eight projects that are currently in various stages of construction and unit repricing. Those are all in my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Brad.
Brad Hill: Thank you, Tim and good morning everyone. Despite the challenges in the transaction market, the team continues to make good progress in executing our disposition plan for the year. In addition to the two Fort Worth properties we sold in the second quarter, we closed on the sale of a 396-unit community in Maryland earlier this month. We have one more disposition property located in the Austin market that we expect to close in the fourth quarter. Total expected proceeds for all four disposition remains at the midpoint of our guidance of $325 million with an NOI yield of 4.3%, generating a total expected IRR for these 25-year-old assets of 17.8%. The slowdown in transaction volume that started in the second quarter continued in the third quarter as dislocation in the capital markets increased over the quarter. Most buyers remain on the sidelines and with only a limited number of properties coming to market, price discovery will take some time. However, as we've seen in previous cycles, when deals begin to come to market, the evaluation of counter-party risks will drive decisions, with buyer financial strength and speed of execution being attractive key differentiators. During the third quarter, we were able to opportunistically use those strengths to close on two compelling newly constructed properties for a total of $213 million, generating an initial stabilized NOI yield of 4.7%, which we expect to increase further through our operating platform capabilities. These investments not only provide a higher immediate NOI yield than what we are selling, but they also give us more scale and higher demand, higher growth markets, where we expect to generate higher organic growth over the long term, especially on an after-CapEx basis. Due to their locations near other MAA communities, both investments also provide additional margin expansion opportunities that we will fully harvest over the next few years. We continue to make progress in building out our development pipeline, while our under-construction pipeline remained at $444 million at the end of the third quarter. Earlier this month, we started construction on a $197 million, 495-unit project in Tampa, bringing our total active under-construction projects today to $641 million, representing 2,254 units. Predevelopment work is nearly complete on our Raleigh project, and we expect to start construction this quarter. With the scheduled completion of our Windmill Hill property in Austin, during the fourth quarter, we expect to end 2022 with approximately 2,310 units under construction at a total cost of $723 million. Also during the third quarter, we purchased a land parcel for a potential late 2023 start of a 500-unit development in the Denver, MSA. We now own seven and control five development sites with total entitlements in place for approximately 3,700 units. As we've indicated in previous quarters, the timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and the construction bidding processes, but we are hopeful we can start a number of these projects over the next 18 months. Having said that, our balance sheet strength gives us the option to be patient and our construction timing, if it's warrant. Our disciplined approach to asset allocation, including site selection and land valuation will continue to be an integral part of our capital deployment decision process. Our construction management team continues to do a tremendous job actively managing our projects and working with our contractors to keep the inflationary pressure surrounding labor and material costs from causing a meaningful increase to our overall development costs or our schedules to help mitigate some of the potential cost escalation and schedule expansion that is prevalent in the market today, we are working with our contractors to make commitments to purchase materials much earlier in the process. Today, our biggest challenges involve securing labor, obtaining cabinets and electrical components and securing building permits. Our team has been able to work around these issues on the majority of our projects to stay on schedule. In line with the performance of our overall portfolio, operating performance at our development communities in their initial lease-up is strong, with results at each community well ahead of our pro forma expectations. Demand remains strong and the competition from other new supply is not impacting our lease-up performance. During the third quarter, our Jefferson Sand Lake Community in Orlando reached stabilization and due predominantly to the strong rent performance, we expect our stabilized NOI yield to be between 7.8% and 8%, exceeding our original expectation by over 25%. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So, I'll turn it over to Al.
Al Campbell: Thank you, Brad and good morning everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.19 was $0.12 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. About $0.75 or $0.9 of the outperformance came from revenues, stronger than expected rental pricing trends continued into the quarter, producing 14.6% same-store revenue growth, which was over 200 basis points above our expectation. Remaining core FFO per share outperformance primarily came from overhead and other non-operating items during the quarter, which were slightly favorable to expectations. Same-store operating expense growth for the third quarter was impacted by continued inflationary pressures as well as a challenging prior year comparison. If you recall, operating expenses grew only 1.5% during the third quarter of last year. Real estate taxes made up the biggest portion of the variance from our expectations for the third quarter this year. We received a significant amount of information during the quarter, particularly in Florida, reflecting some pressure in both values and millers rates as compared to our expectations. We will continue to aggressively challenge values where we can, but we now expect our real estate tax expense to be at the higher end of our previous range. Revised guidance for the year discussed more in a moment, reflects these expense pressures, but they continue to be more than offset by the strong revenue performance. Our balance sheet remains stronger than ever, providing both protection and opportunity as we move through this volatile market environment. In August, we received an upgrade from S&P to an A- credit rating. We're now rated A- by both S&P and Fitch and continue to have positive discussions with Moody's, which we believe will eventually lead to an upgrade. We also completed the early renewal of our unsecured credit facility at very attractive pricing levels during the quarter, and upside facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion despite a challenging financing market. In addition, we expanded the size of our commercial paper program from $500 million to $625 million to reflect the increase in our credit facility. These two programs provide significant low-cost and flexible capital development program and our future capital needs. At the end of the quarter, we had over $1.2 billion of combined cash and borrowing capacity available. Our leverage remains historically low. Net debt adjusted EBITDA rate of only 3.97 times. Our debt balances also have significant protection from rising interest rates, as over 97% of our debt is fixed at an average interest rate of 3.4% and with an average maturity of eight years. Finally, given the third quarter outperformance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased our full year range for core FFO by $0.20 per share at the midpoint to a range of $8.37 and $8.53 per share or $8.45 at the midpoint, which now represents a 21% growth over the prior year. This increase is primarily a result of higher revenue growth as the strong pricing trends continued into the third quarter with the projected impact of prior year comparisons and seasonal trends coming later than originally projected. We now expect same-store revenue growth for the year to be 13.5% at the midpoint, primarily driven by 125 basis points increase and our effective rent growth expectation for the year over our previous guidance. Our revenue projection for the year continues to be built on strong pricing performance and stable occupancy were growing impact from prior year comps and normal seasonal trends during the fourth quarter. We're now seeing the beginning of this impact, albeit a few months later than originally projected. We expect average blended lease pricing to be in the 7% to 8% range for the fourth quarter, which for context is on top of a record high 16% growth captured in the fourth quarter of last year. We also narrowed the expected range for same-store operating expenses for the full year, effectively increasing the midpoint by 25 basis points from last year's guidance -- from last quarter's guidance, excuse me, primarily reflecting the pressure from real estate taxes that I mentioned earlier. The overall impact of these changes is an increase to our same-store NOI growth guidance for the year by 200 basis points to a midpoint of 17%. So, that's all we have in the way of prepared comments, Riesa. We'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: We will now open the call now up for questions. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Your line is open.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Just given your experience recently in the transaction market, particularly on the sales, but as you look to acquire maybe if there's interesting opportunities and kind of the positives you mentioned in terms of being a certainty a buyer. How are you thinking cap rates have trended? And then how are you changing your underwriting standards for any future potential opportunities?
Brad Hill: Yes. Hey Nick, this is Brad. I'd say we've certainly seen cap rates come up here in the third quarter as we've seen interest rates really rise very quickly. Now interest rates are regularly over 6%. We don't have a whole lot of data points frankly, in the third quarter. Second quarter, we commented we saw cap rates in the 37% range. For what we did see close in the third quarter, call it, 4.5% is really where we saw cap rates. But again, not a whole lot of trades there. And I would say that what we've seen -- for what has traded is there's been some characteristic about the property really that has allowed the buyer really to take advantage frequently of previous debt rates through loan assumptions, while taking advantage of the rent profile today. So, I would say that what has traded so far, in my opinion, is not reflective of where the market is going. Most of what we're hearing today is new assets that are being priced. BOVs are going out today 5% or more in terms of the cap rate. So, I would expect to see cap rates rise from where they are today. Where they shake out, that's hard to say. But given where interest rates are, over 6%, given where we are starting to see seasonality come back into play, which we did in last year. The appetite for a significant level of negative leverage from a buyer's perspective, I think that appetite is dissipating a bit. So, my sense is that we'll continue to see cap rates rise a bit next year. But I think it will be mid next year before we really start to see some transactions come to market and transactions to clear. So, I think it's going to take some time to really get visibility into what that looks like.
Nick Joseph: That's very helpful. And then maybe just tying that environment to the new starts and any plans for starts. How do you think about kind of underwriting or starting the project today given maybe the uncertainty of where the acquisition cap rate and trying to price a net risk premium on development?
Brad Hill: Yes, I mean I'll back up and just start with, we have purposefully sat out of the acquisition market over the last couple of years. The last deal we purchased was in 2019 because really the spreads between development yield and acquisition cap rates had gotten really large over the last few years. So, we have purposefully focused our capital on development. Where we sit today with cap rates of 4.5%, perhaps moving up to 5%, I think you're going to get back to a more normal 100, 125, 150 basis point spread between cap rates and development yields. So, I think there'll need to be some movement going forward. And all of that is really dependent upon the quality of the development that you have where it's located, what the rent trajectory looks like on that asset. But clearly, I think for starts going into next year on the development side, I think you're likely to see a drop off in the construction starts. Developers, we obviously are active in the JV market partnering with developers. We are certainly hearing that equity partners on deals are backing out. Some of the pipeline, I think, is shrinking as you go forward from here because those yields do need to go up a bit. So, we're hopeful at this point that some of that starts to manifest itself through construction costs. But as you know, just like land costs, it's a little sticky. It takes time for that to manifest itself down into the cost, but we are certainly hopeful that yields expand a bit on the development pipeline.
Nick Joseph: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Neil Malkin with Capital One. Your line is open.
Neil Malkin: Good morning everyone. Great quarter. Congrats. First, high level, Eric, good to talk with you. I think last quarter -- last two quarters, you kind of started your comments by saying you expect given the favorable demand trends that rent growth or same-store top line trends will continue to be nicely above trend for, I don't know if it was like 2023 or the foreseeable future. But maybe can you just comment on if you still think that's the case? And if, I guess, a more uncertain macro cloud over the general U.S. and global economy maybe has changed that in the near-term? Thanks.
Eric Bolton: Well, thanks, Neil. What I would tell you is that as we start to think about the next year 2023, I'm pretty encouraged still about our ability to continue to drive top line performance that's going to be well above our long-term averages. As Tim alluded to, based on where we sit today, we think the earn-in to next year based on the rent trajectories that we've captured over the last number of months is baked in next year is going to be 6% and then you start to think about what sort of market rent growth we're going to get on top of that next year. And as we sit here today and think about the drivers of demand surrounding the employment markets, the stress of single-family affordability and these net continued positive migration trends that we see across our markets, we continue to see an expectation lease I have a positive rent growth next year on top of the earn-in that we're getting. Now, there is more discussion surrounding the prospects for a recession. I think generally, the thought at the moment is that if it happens, it tends to be -- it will likely be not particularly severe and not particularly prolonged. Certainly, that's the hope we have. And we also are hearing that the idea that it's going to have a huge negative effect on the labor market, in the employment market in general, is not likely to occur. So, who knows exactly what's going to happen. But as we sit here today, we continue to feel pretty positive about the outlook going into next year. And we are -- there are a lot of things that we're doing to prepare for the potential for more negative outlooks, particularly pushing rent growth is something that we always do as we think we may be heading into a downturn. Of course, the balance sheet is in really great shape, and we're keeping a lot of capacity available to deal with opportunities that might emerge in a more recessionary environment. And we think that we're going to be well-positioned for whatever we likely are going to see next year. But to your question, I mean, as we sit here today, it's hard to see anything at the moment that suggests to us that any meaningful pullback on the demand trends that we're seeing is likely to take place.
Neil Malkin: Okay, great. And then real quick, did you guys give your loss to lease, I apologize if I missed it.
Tim Argo: Well, Neil, this is Tim. We talked about the 6% sort of earned in that we think we have next year. If you look at kind of -- I think the question you're probably asking is sort of where our rents sit today here in September compared to are all in place rents that's roughly 3.5% from where we sit today.
Neil Malkin: Okay. And then the other -- last one for me is maybe for Brad. When you think about the elevated supply or delivery environment over the next 12 months plus you look at the much more difficult permanent financing environment, LTVs, terms, et cetera. And then you also layer on sort of the -- what you expect to be rising cap rates. I mean maybe just talk -- give a sense for like how your capital allocation priorities or playbook looks heading into 2023, particularly given the current cost of -- or the -- your current share price? Thanks.
Brad Hill: Yes. Well, I'll certainly talk about the external piece of that. As we sit here today, as I mentioned in my comments, we have really spent a lot of time developing our ability to deploy capital externally, both through acquisitions and development. And we are in a really good spot for that. We control, as I mentioned, 3,700 units, both owned and sites that we just have under contract. So, in the land basis of those, as I mentioned, we've been very disciplined in picking sites and we've lost out on sites because, one, the location wasn't the best location in a market and ones that are likely to stress more if things get a little bit shaky in the economy or the land price was too high. So, we feel really good about where we stand today in that regard. And so we have optionality on those projects given the size of our balance sheet. It's not a problem for us to continue to work those sites get to a point where we're ready to pull permits. And if the financing environment is such that it doesn't make sense for us to pull on those or our capital is better used in the acquisition market. We'll certainly lean into that. Just for perspective, in the acquisition side of things, after the last recession for a three-year period, 2010 to 2012, we executed on almost 10,000 units, single transactions, 9,500 units. And if we were able that similar type environment plays out over the next year, two years, three years. that's 10,000 units and at today's pricing even at a discount, that's $3 billion to $4 billion. And so that's what we're really preparing for is for an environment where we're able to execute on opportunities. It may or may not be that size of opportunities. But to your point, the amount of construction that started in 2020, 2021 in our region of the country was significant. And as you mentioned, the cost to refinance that, the cost to extend loans, banks are not going to be willing to do that. They want to clear these loans off their books at this point. So I think you will see, as you get into next year, a number of these merchant developers will need to transact. And I also think the basis of these developments that went under construction in 2020, 2021 still have profit in them. So, I do think a market will be made on these assets, and there will be an opportunity for us to step in and execute in that area.
Neil Malkin: Hey that’s awesome. Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey good morning. Just going back to Nick Joseph's question on underwriting, I think you guys quoted a 17% levered IRR on the transactions in the quarter. So one is, curious what the unlevered IRR is. And then second, more importantly, you guys Sunbelt over the past decade or so has benefited big time from cap rate compression. Certainly, as your comments just said, everyone expects cap rates to come up. So, how do you think IRRs are going to -- how are you underwriting IRRs over the next sort five years of investing, given that the past decade has just been this incredible dual tailwind to both cap rate compression and rent growth? So first, what the unlevered IRRs were on the deals sold in the quarter and then two, the latter part, how you're underwriting new deals without the benefit of the compression tailwind?
Brad Hill: I'll start with that, and Eric can jump in if he needs to. The unlevered IRR on what we expect to sell this year is just under 13%. So still a really good IRR generated on those assets, which I'll also mention just, by the way, our 25-year-old assets to generate those IRRs. In terms of cap rate compression, yes, we've benefited from that over the last few years. And that will not obviously be the case going forward. But I think that's -- indicates really a healthy environment where we get back to the point where location of assets really matters, and that will drive the value of an asset. And I think that benefits us long term because I think we've got some of the best located assets in the best markets in our region of the country. And I think that differentiation between cap rates based on location and markets will absolutely benefit us as we go forward from here.
Eric Bolton: And Alex, this is Eric. And I'll add to what Brad is saying there that cap rates in a given market and cap rates across this region. It's a function of two things. It's a function of obviously what's happening with interest rates and how asset pricing is being reconfigured, if you will. But to some degree, cap rates are also a function of sort of the demand-supply dynamic for capital -- investment capital wanting to deploy in apartment real estate. And you get a lot of buyers in the market trying to chase a few sale opportunities is going to head downward pressure more so on cap rates. And what I would tell you is that this region of the country that we do business in, these markets continue to show very strong demand dynamics leading to job growth, population growth, household formation trends. Those variables were present before COVID, and they were strong during COVID. And so as a consequence of that, I think that as you begin to think about how cap rates may change, I would argue that we may not see cap rates move up as much across a number of our markets as you might think. And we may -- and I would argue that they're not going to move up as much as you might see in other markets or other regions of the country because of the rent growth prospects and the demand dynamics that we are seeing that are so positive across this region of the country. And then to your other point about IRR, candidly, it's not something that we spend a lot of energy focusing on. Most of the modeling that we do is built on kind of a 10-year model. And to try to think about what an extra cap rate would be appropriate in 10 years from now is who knows. And what we're really looking to do is compare the opportunity to deploy capital, create a stabilized yield on that capital that is complementary to the existing yield. We're getting off the existing asset base and then also obviously look at it on an after-CapEx basis, so as we think about the opportunity to continue to grow the dividend. And as we look at an opportunity in front of us at the moment, certainly, the development continues to make a lot of sense. We're going to be very thoughtful and careful with that. As we've talked about in the past, we're not going to see our development pipeline get more than about 3% or so of our enterprise value. So, we're going to keep it at a very manageable level. But we have a lot of dry powder that we're keeping available at the moment because should the opportunity on the acquisition front really start to pick up and present itself in a big way, we'll be ready to jump on that and we've demonstrated in the past that a lot of value opportunity in that sort of focus.
Alexander Goldfarb: Eric, that's helpful. So, the second question plays into that. A lot of market talk about concern about supply in the Sunbelt, it seems that over time, the Sunbelt has handily handled supply, maybe with the exception of like the Houston, for example. So maybe you could just talk a little bit more about some of the supply that you're seeing in the market. Do you see it just sort of dispersed across your markets? Do you see it more concentrated in certain submarkets? And are there any areas where you could see yourself maybe next summer going, yes, this market or that market, we have felt a supply impact?
Eric Bolton: Well, broadly speaking, on the supply picture, I mean, what we see right now based on the data that we're looking at suggests that 2023 deliveries are going to be very comparable to what we saw in 2022. And actually based -- when you do an NOI-weighted analysis against our portfolio, it's actually down just slightly in 2023 versus 2022. So, I don't think that -- we're not sitting here today looking at numbers that suggest to us that we're going to see a big lift in the supply deliveries next year relative to what we've been experiencing for the last year or two, particularly last year or 2022, I should say. So we -- because of some of the challenges that we've seen with construction labor and materials and permitting and all that goes into predevelopment, we're just -- we just don't see supply likely picking up, broadly speaking, in a huge way next year in 2023 as compared to what we've experienced in 2022. The other thing that I will tell you, to your point, Alex, is, yes, I mean, I've heard about new supply worries for 28 years since I've been here. And it's -- and I will tell you, it's never been a problem. It can create some moderation here and there across the portfolio, given markets, given submarkets from time to time. But it's never been such an issue for us that we haven't been able to work through it. And one of the things that we've always done with our strategy is we work very hard to do what we can to mitigate some of the supply pressure it does occur from time to time. That's one of the reasons why we are diversified the way we are in both secondary as well as in large markets. We have a very affordable price point broadly in our portfolio. The new product coming in to the market is generally running 25%, 30% higher rents than what we are charging that creates some room for us, if you will, in terms of being able to weather that pressure, not only that, but also creates a tremendous opportunity on the redevelopment front. So we're -- as we sit here today, we are not particularly nervous about supply levels next year as we go into 2023.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question today from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks and good morning everyone. Eric, you and the team have referenced being open to a large transaction I think probably over a year now and have been historically. And I'm just curious what you think the benefits of additional scale are to the company at this point? And what really would you be trying to achieve strategically from a portfolio allocation standpoint through a potentially larger deal?
Eric Bolton: Well, it's hard to put a number on or quantify what additional financial benefits may come from scale. We feel like, frankly, at the point we are at the moment that we're fairly efficient in terms of what we're able to do. Certainly, put more assets against this existing platform, there's going to be at the margin, some additional opportunity that comes from that, but it's not something that we're candidly, actively trying to initiate, if you will, right now. For us, right, our focus really is the opportunity to drive increasing scale in a very disciplined fashion through the development effort that we have and through emerging opportunity for one-off acquisitions that we've done a lot of over the years. And we think that with our development pipeline headed towards $700 billion of active construction with emerging opportunities surrounding acquisitions that we think are likely to pick up more so next year, it puts us in a position to put together fairly meaningful levels of external growth that we think we can capture just through those processes that we have without the need to go out and do something more strategic in nature. We're always open to those ideas and we'll continue to monitor it, but it's not something that we feel compelling need to do in any way right now.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. And then I'm curious, where do you guys expect market rent growth across your portfolio to end the year? And just to be clear, I'm focused on sort of your broader submarkets, not the MAA portfolio specifically. And then do you think next year should be higher, lower or sort of in line with 2022?
Tim Argo: Austin, this is Tim. The market rent growth we've seen to date is about 7% or so, when you strip out sort of the baked in and everything else. It's hard to say that we expect rent growth next year to be at the level that we've seen this year, which certainly has been between this year and 2021 then record levels. But as Eric laid out a little bit ago, we don't see in the near-term, anything changing too much from the demand standpoint, supply kind of is what it is, like we talked about. So, we think we're still in a period where we can see some better than average, if you will, but likely not to the extent we're seeing the last 12 months or so.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's fair. And then just last quick clarification. What's embedded in the 8.3% blended lease rate for October between new and renewal? And then presumably, should we assume, I think you said 7% to 8% for all of 4Q that you don't expect a lot of movement there through the balance of the year?
Tim Argo: So, as we said, the October new lease is 5.7%, renewal is 10.7% and the comment we did make around the rest of the year as we're seeing on the renewal side, somewhere around that 10% for what we've signed so far.
Al Campbell: I'll just follow-up that the forecast that we've put out does imply a 7% to 8% blended for the fourth quarter. You're right, we don't expect it to move much, number one. And remember, there's -- most of the leases have been signed in the second and third quarter already anyway.
Austin Wurschmidt: Of course. No, that’s great. Thanks guys.
Operator: And we will take our next question today from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Nick Yulico: Thanks. Good morning everyone. I wanted to go back to the 15% of move-ins or relocations from the coast. I think it's surprising to hear people wouldn't expect that the numbers are still strong on that versus a year ago. And so I guess what I'm wondering is if you have any insight on whether certain markets are benefiting more within your portfolio? And then from a relocation standpoint, what you've learned from where -- which coastal regions people are moving? And also maybe you could talk about do you have any insight on the job profile of the people who are moving.
Tim Argo: Nick, this is Tim. Yes, we're at the 15% for Q3 for sort of move-ins from non-M&A states. That's been pretty consistent. It's kind of range from that 14% to 16% sort of range back to the beginning of 2021 or so. And so we're seeing it consistent. It's coming primarily from New York and California, some of that makes sense given they're the largest states. But particularly some of the markets that are benefiting are Dallas, Tampa, Nashville, Charleston, Phoenix, Savannah. Those are the largest ones, and that's been pretty consistent. And we are seeing our -- the quality of resident, if you will, and the income levels have been pretty strong. Our rent-to-income ratio stay consistent now for the last couple of years, around 22%. So, we are seeing more sort of professionals, finance and tech and that sort of thing coming into our markets.
Nick Yulico: And is there any insight on that -- that's helpful, Tim. Any insight on whether these people are working remotely or in physical in-person jobs in your cities?
Tim Argo: It's hard to say. We haven't seen any big significant changes that we've noticed at the property level. It's a little bit hard to tell, but I think it's -- there's certainly some, but not -- probably not quite to the level we saw like a year or so ago.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Thanks. And then just following up on some of the supply questions. I mean as you look across your markets, over the next year, maybe you could just point out which markets you do see some incremental supply pressure that could be meaningful versus some other larger markets where the supply impact looks pretty manageable.
Tim Argo: Yes. To point out a couple, we think we'll be on the higher side, likely are Austin and Charlotte would be a couple and Austin's a pretty interesting test case. It's had high supply now for a few years in a row. Expect that to continue, but it also ranks at the top in terms of job growth, in migration, household formation, population. So I think to the extent that demand side stays where it is. We don't -- despite that supply, we don't think it will have a significant impact. Dallas is one where supply has been pretty light, and we've seen that market come on pretty strong over the last few months. We think Dallas is one that can that can perform pretty well. The rest of the markets, it's pretty evenly spread, but also in Charlotte being the two that we'll probably keep our eye on a little more.
Nick Yulico: All right. Thanks guys.
Operator: And we will go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
John Kim: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to understand this dynamic. You had the strongest lease-over-lease growth rates this quarter among your peers, when you ended the quarter with the lowest loss to lease and that same dynamic has continued sort of like this quarter, low loss to lease, highest rent growth. I'm just wondering if there's a unique way that you calculate loss to lease or maybe there's a timing difference. And if the loss to lease today, it's roughly 3%, is that roughly where your lease growth will be going forward?
Tim Argo: So, the loss release of 3.5%, the way that is calculated is basically just looking at the rents we did in September that went into effect in September as compared to all in-place rents right now, and that's 3.5%. And so we typically see that number. That's calculated in that way. It's going to be the highest in the summer when rents are strongest and the seasonality is the strongest. It will come down a little bit as you get into the fall and likely into the winter, assuming you're seeing that normal seasonality. So that -- in my opinion, that number is pretty volatile. I mean it's going to move around. And that's why one of the points we're making is with where we expect December to be in all of our in-place rents that will be there in December, if you just carry that through to 2023 and assume we don't get any more rent growth, you get to 6%. So to me, that's -- in terms of trying to figure out what it's going to do to impact 2023, that's kind of why we focus on that 6%.
John Kim: Okay. So, it's in placement versus what you signed versus the market, which may or may not be the same number. My second question is the concept of rent control has almost been an overnight potential risk in Orlando, one of your top five markets. And I'm wondering if you're concerned that this may actually be tasked given it was just put on the ballot as a few weeks ago, and you may not have enough time to educate voters on the downfalls of rent control.
Rob DelPriore: Hey John, this is Rob. Yes, I think if it gets on the ballot, I think it's okay. The one court that's actually looked at the ordinance itself effectively said that they consider that it violates for a law. So even if it passes, ultimately, I don't think that it will be upheld as an effective ordinance. And then if you look at it for us, we've got nine properties in Orange County, seven in same-store, and it's about 4.4% of our third quarter same-store NOI. And we went back and looked at it as it were in place in 2022, and it would really only have an 18 basis point impact on same-store revenue and about a 17 basis point impact on total revenue. So overall, not that material to us as we think about it. So, we think it probably doesn't pass, and we think it's not material to us overall anyway. And also that was in some of the highest growth rate rent increases that we've had over this period in Orange County compared to until recently, a relatively low CPI.
John Kim: Regardless if it passes or not, does it change the way that you look at how much you push renewal lease?
Rob DelPriore: I mean if it passes will be guarded in how much we push renewal rates until there's a court decision that says that it's invalid.
Eric Bolton: And John, as I think you know, if it passes, it's only good for one year, and then they have to go through the process again. So again, we think that the downside risk to us is, frankly, fairly small in this topic.
John Kim: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question today from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Brad Heffern: Hey good morning everybody. Thanks. So, there's been a big divergence in how single-family home prices have been trending and you have some areas in the Southeast that have been holding up well, but then you have markets like Austin and Phoenix where they're dropping significantly. Obviously, multifamily is different than single family. But I'm curious if you're seeing any differences in apartment demand in areas where you're seeing home prices show more weakness.
Tim Argo: Hey, this is Tim. Not necessarily. I mean we look obviously at the move-outs to home buying and that sort of thing, and it's become a much smaller piece of our turnover, and that's pretty consistent across the market. So with the recent move up in interest rates, I think that probably continues even if with prices have gone down, interest rates have gone up. So the total cost is not any less than it really was before. So right now, we're not seeing any change from what we've been seeing.
Brad Heffern: Okay. What I was sort of getting at is, is there any sort of like underlying demand weakness in general for housing in a market like Austin or Phoenix that looks somewhat new?
Tim Argo: Yes, we're not seeing traffic has been up across the board in pretty much all of our markets. We're not seeing any of the kind of doubling up. Our average occupant per unit is the same, whether you're looking at efficiencies, one-bedrooms, two-bedrooms, three-bedrooms. So we're not seeing enough phenomenon of people trying to double up or anything like that. So, as of right now, all the trends that we look at for that kind of thing have been pretty consistent.
Brad Heffern: Okay, got it. Thanks for that. And then on the development starts that you mentioned for this quarter, can you talk about what the expected yield is on those?
Brad Hill: Yes, this is Brad. Both of those are 5.5%, which is what we have been consistently underwriting recently. But I will say for both of these deals. We feel really, really good one, about the location of those assets. And then two, just about our ability to outperform that. As we -- I indicated in my comments, the outperformance on our recent Jefferson Sand Lake project. Certainly, that's a little bit different because of the cost basis, but there are some characteristics there that I think carry over to all of our developments. And number one is that we're very conservative in our rent growth projections on these assets significantly below what the market rent growth projections are over the first three or four years, which gives us a level of conservatism. Number two, I would say that as we expect over the next year or so, costs could come down on the construction side, which means we are less likely to dip into contingency and things of that nature on our projects. If we're able to save those expenses on these projects, that's a, call it, a 40 basis points improvement in yields on that. And then I would say the third thing is that our taxes that we have underwritten on these projects are reflective of today's valuation. So, to the extent we get some relief in that area. It's a lagging -- kind of a lagging item. But if we get some relief in that area, we also will see some relief on our expense pressure on the tax side. So we feel really good about where we've underwritten those assets and our ability to really improve the yields from the conservative numbers that we underwrote.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Appreciate.
Operator: We will take our next question today from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Your line is open. Rich Anderson, your line is open, please check the mute function on your phone.
Rich Anderson: Sorry about that. My headset never works anymore. First of all, congrats to Tom. As I get older, I get increasingly envious when I hear retirement. So congratulations. I also hit you. My first question is somewhat related to loss to lease, but not entirely. We did kind of a quick analysis of the multifamily space at some point between second and third quarter to compare your rent versus the average rent within your markets, including all competitors and so on. And you sit at about 7% above the average market rent. I don't know if you agree or disagree with that, but that's where we came on MAA. I'm wondering if you think that in a recession being above the market average is a comfortable place to be if people start to reduce their cost structure in a recessionary environment and they might dial down to lower quality and so on so that they can continue to have their own apartment, is that a pressure that you're worried about at all? You're seeing at all where you guys are operating perhaps a cream of the crop level versus some of your competition, but could be -- put you in a vulnerable spot if we do get into a deeper type of recession.
Eric Bolton: Rich, this is Eric. I would tell you, I mean, frankly, we think that our price point in the markets where we do business is exactly where we want to be. I wouldn't -- 7% above average, I wouldn't call a cream of the crop. Cream the crop is going to be to all the new stuff that's been built in the last two or three years, which is going to be 20% to 30% higher than the market average. If we had a portfolio of nothing. But that -- yes, I'd be more nervous about it. But what we typically see is a trade down from the really high-end product to our more affordable product to then go significantly below the market average, you start to get into a different submarket and you start to get into less amenities and you start to get into a product that is going to, I think, not be as appealing, if you will, to a lot of the resident profile that we serve. And I think that what we are likely to see if we find ourselves in a recession where people are really starting to think about how to lower their housing cost as you're going to see people in the very top end of the market doubling up in our properties. And I think that, that's what we've seen in the past and what we would likely see again if we found ourselves in a deep recession.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Good enough. And then the second question is early in the calls mentioned new rents to your point, new developments coming in at 22% -- rents 22% above where you guys are, which invites the opportunity to do upgrades to your portfolio. But that strategy only works if that 22% higher rent is actually working. In other words, those developments that are happening and coming to market are leasing up effectively and quickly. Are you still seeing that, whether it's you or somebody else are developments meeting expectations? Or is that starting to wane a little bit? And then if that is the case, maybe the idea of this being an opportunity for you to upgrade your existing portfolio, maybe takes a bit of a backseat.
Brad Hill: Rich, this is Brad. I'll address the part of that, which is the current lease-up dynamics in the market. We're certainly not seeing pressure and struggles from the development community in terms of the lease-up performance of assets that are in lease-up. I mean our -- the five properties that we have right now that are in lease-up, if they're an example the lease-up velocity continues to be very, very strong. And those are the products, by the way, that are competing directly with the new supply in the market. velocities are strong. Traffic is still very good in our markets. And then the rents on those assets continue to outperform. So if that's a proxy for what we're seeing in the market, we're just not seeing in our region of the country struggling fundamentals yet even on the new development side. So, we're not seeing developers under pressure, fire selling their -- or leasing their properties and offering multiple months concessions. We're not seeing that at this point. Everybody is pretty disciplined. The fundamentals still appear to be very, very strong in the lease-up properties.
Tim Argo: Rich, I'll add one point to that. The areas we're actually doing some unit interior renovates this year and the ones we're looking at for next year, it's actually a little bit wider debt kind of in that 25% to 27% range on the comps we're looking at. And we're not looking to get to that rent. We're -- as you know, we're kind of usually getting in that 9% to 10% range. So still creates that gap that we think we can execute on.
Rich Anderson: Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much.
Operator: And we will go next to Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Chandni Luthra: Hi good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just have one. How do you think about the outlook for real estate taxes next year, I mean you talked about Florida a little bit? But last quarter, you had spoken about expectation of rollbacks in Texas. So, what are you seeing there right now? And how do you think about real estate taxes going into 2023? Thank you.
Al Campbell: Yes, this is Al. I can touch on that. So as we talked about, really in our portfolio, Texas, Florida and even Georgia, they are the primary areas of our taxes and our pressure that we've been saying together. They're somewhere around probably a little bit over two-thirds of our tax cost. And the primary pressure comes from Texas and Florida that you just mentioned. And so for the full year, that certainly we're looking at Texas is probably a little over half of that two-thirds. So, you see the significance there. We spend a lot of time working on challenging the values as we talked about when we're from informal to formal. So a lot of pressure on that. I think -- and so -- the change this quarter though was really about information coming in, in Florida. We got a lot of information late and they typically do that and it caused us to believe that the values were a little higher than we thought they were going to be in Florida and the miller rates so we're seeing rollbacks not quite what we're expecting. So, I would say that in general, across the portfolio, we talked about high assessments with rollbacks, that's still occurring. And we are seeing that occur, not quite what we'd expected that caused that increase that we put in the guidance. As we look into next year, I think it's important to think about there's two main components you got to look at one -- it's obviously a backward-looking process. And so you're going to have one positive impact maybe the change in cap rate environment that we talked about that this morning. But the other side is they're looking at a really strong top line revenue growth this year when they set the values. So both those coming together, what we would say is as we look forward next year probably looks a lot like this year with maybe a little bit of upward bias because of that strong revenue performance. But as we move into 2024, and pass some of the comments Brad was saying on the acquisitions and development, you would expect that the things settle down and we make a little bit of moderation at that point because of the stabilized cap rate and rent growth environments.
Chandni Luthra: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question today from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning guys. Al, why the $0.16 range for fourth quarter FFO per share, seems wide sitting here basically November one with a limited number of leases rolling through year-end? What drives you towards the low and high end of that range?
Al Campbell: I think we moved that, Rob, we certainly do that each quarter as we look at it. And just really, I think it would be something significant occupancy really at this point. I mean I think -- or some unforeseen item that we didn't anticipate. So I think to your point, -- the rent pricing that is the biggest piece is pretty certain and depending on -- excuse me, performance is pretty certain. Even if the pricing moves around from that expectation on the tip of the spear, the few leases in the fourth quarter, so that would have a less impact. It would have to be something in occupancy or in significant surprise in expenses. We don't expect that. And we did continue to narrow our range showing that there's a little more certainty, but I just felt that was prudent to leave that at that level.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And in terms of the expenses, are you having any material hurricane expenses here in the fourth quarter?
Al Campbell: We're -- you saw in the release, we had -- in the third quarter, we incurred about $1.6 million of expenses for that. We were very fortunate in our portfolio there. I think had minimal impact from that. We'll have some cleanup costs and some water intrusion and some roofing things. But expense incurred $1.6 million which you saw it's not -- it's in -- it's in operating expenses outside of same store. You see that disclosed in the press release. We'll have a little bit more capital items. But together, the cost are going to be pretty significant. We are very fortunate.
Rob Stevenson: All right. And are you seeing any uptick in the last 30, 60 days in either bad debt or delinquencies in the portfolio?
Al Campbell: We're -- I'll let Rob talk about the details if he wants to. But we have very good performance really going all the way back to COVID. The biggest spread was worse point about 200 basis points of delinquency. We have been, for the last several quarters, very good, though we've almost our normal long-term range, which is about 40 to 50 basis points. We call it 60 to 70 basis points now. So we've been performing very well, not quite to where we were pre-COVID but certainly performing very well.
Tim Argo: Just one point there, Rob, to is just our current resident receivable balance is about September 30 is about $5 million compared to $5.3 million at June 30. So kind of as Al said, I mean, trending down in the right direction.
Rob Stevenson: All right. And then last one for me. Why only 658 smart homes in the third quarter versus more than 9,000 in the second quarter and 2000 to 3000 expected in the fourth quarter? Was it a supply of the devices issue? Was it something else that sort of drove the sort of lull in the third quarter on that?
Tim Argo: Yes, there is a little bit of supply chain issues there and getting -- there's a couple of different models out there and kind of getting some of the new ones in that we think will happen in the fourth quarter. We had preplanned everything we did in the first couple of quarters, which is why it was skewed that way, but we expect to get a little more normal time line here in the fourth quarter and then certainly into 2023 as well.
Rob Stevenson: All right. Tom, you'll be missed, wish you all the best. Thanks guys.
Operator: We will move next to Alan Peterson with Green Street. Your line is open.
Alan Peterson: Hey guys. Thanks for the time. I was just hoping to follow Eric's comments on the trade down dynamic. Tim, based on the conversations you're having with your field level personnel, are you starting to notice that trade-down occur in your portfolio in any given market?
Tim Argo: Not necessarily. I mean I will say, actually, if you look at our blended pricing for Q3 more of our B-style assets or which you might consider the B assets in our portfolio actually did a little bit better in terms of blended pricing. So we're not seeing our existing portfolio. The turnover was a little higher in some of our secondary markets that have some B assets, but we're also replacing those with residents where the rent to income ratio has not changed. So I think to the extent we are seeing it here and there, we're able to quickly replace it with residents that have that strong affordability.
Alan Peterson: Awesome. And then in regards to the price sensitivity, what markets are you seeing the most price sensitivity? Would it be those secondary markets that are seeing a little bit higher turnover versus the rest of the portfolio? Is it -- are there any other primary markets that are flashing maybe a yellow versus red right now?
Tim Argo: No, like I said, in the secondary markets, the pricing performance has been pretty strong and the B type asset has been pretty strong. I mean, we are seeing some moderation. Most of it's driven by seasonality. Phoenix is one that's moderated a little bit, but it has had a really strong rent growth now for two to three years straight. But the demand fundamentals, as we talked about, are really strong. Supply kind of is what it is at a similar level. But outside of Houston and D.C., which we talked about, have been a little bit weaker markets, all the other ones are hanging in pretty consistently with what they've been doing.
Alan Peterson: Understood. Well, appreciate the time guys.
Operator: We will take our next question today from Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is open.
Wes Golladay: Hey good morning everyone and congratulations, Tom. I just have a quick question on the -- more the private developer. What are they saying today yields have been quite volatile. But if rates were to stay where they're at today, where do you think your required yield would be for a new development? And when I look at Mid-America, I think best-in-class balance sheet operations, you trend had imply fixed cap cost of capital may be around 7%. I mean at a high level, I'm thinking if things stay where they're at, it has to be in the high single digits. Would you agree with that?
Brad Hill: This is Brad. I would say that's probably a little higher. I mean I think what developers are generally trying to solve for is return on cost, a year one return on cost on their development, similar to what we're looking at on a stabilized yield. But those are trending up to over 6% at this point. I think aside from construction costs, really what the developers have been hit with is interest rates have gone from call it, 3.5%, 4% and now they're probably double that. So, their interest expense have gone up tremendously on their projects. Really, in the -- from the underwriting perspective because of the seasonality we're seeing that didn't see earlier this year, I suspect when they go back in at this point, and get construction cost price updates they may not increase quite as much as they have been, but their rent growth when they update those at this point is showing seasonality. So their yields are probably under pressure from that. And then also just the interest expense line item. So, developments, I was at a conference last week with quite a few developers in their is a general sense that most projects at this point that are not kicked off really are being pushed out. Land timing is being pushed out. Projects are being shelved at this point. So, I think there's just a broad recalibration going on in the market. And it's hard to say what developers are looking for in the private side, but it's definitely higher than what it has been and it's going to be somewhere return on cost in the six to mid-6% range, I suspect.
Wes Golladay: That’s great. Thank you for that.
Operator: We will go now to Barry [Indiscernible] from Mizuho Group. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Barry on for [Indiscernible]. First of all, congratulations on an impressive quarter. I just wanted to get some clarity on the renewal rates you cited. I know correctly that it was 5.7% in October, but expecting 10% in the fourth quarter overall.
Tim Argo: No. The 5.7 was the new lease rate in October. Renewals were 10.6.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. thank you. And on the typical seasonality being pushed back, do you see weaker demand and recent traffic kind of a potential headwind in Q1 and Q2?
Tim Argo: We've not seen any lag or any reduction in leasing traffic. We talked about our traffic in Q3 was up, our leads are up. So the seasonality will just be relative to Q2 and Q3, yes, traffic will be lower and leads will be lower than what we see in those quarters, but no different than we typically expect to see in the winter season. So there's nothing to indicate anything different other than as we've talked about, I do think the seasonal or the normal seasonality returns more so this year, certainly that we did not see last year.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks. And my second question is on just bad debt trends. We've seen some of your coastal peers report an uptake. Is that kind of what you're seeing?
Tim Argo: What trend, you kind of cut out there for a second.
Unidentified Analyst: Just a trend in your bad debt portfolio, bad debt?
Tim Argo: I think we just talked about a moment ago, I think we've had a very good performance in our bad debt. Our delinquencies for really the last year, 1.5 years. So I think we're a little above in delinquency. Our long-term rate, which is really low 40 to 50 basis points of rents historically, we call it, 60, 70 basis points range, but still very strong. Don't see an indication that says that's changing today or expect that change as we move into fourth quarter next year.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we will go now to Aaron Hecht from JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Aaron Hecht: Thanks for taking my question. Times relocating from the coast, are those renters typically more transient? And do they typically move to buy a home more quickly or for a trend in terms of those coastal renters come in?
Tim Argo: We haven't seen any indications that are more transient. I mean if you -- or certainly more transient to move back out of our footprint. We've talked about the move-ins from out of footprint, bringing in that 15% range now for a while. The move back out of our footprint is 5% has been that way for a long time. So we don't see any trends that they're moving back to where they came from, so to speak, and haven't seen any significant trends and types of turnover, anything like that. So no indications of it.
Aaron Hecht: Yes, I was saying more wealthy renter that's entering the market or looking for a holding purchase, but it doesn't sound like it. How is that 15% rate this quarter compared to like pre-pandemic over the last several quarters. Is that increase significantly?
Tim Argo: It was -- I would say, pre-COVID at range in that 9% to 10% range. So we have seen it pick up some, but it has now remained consistent, like we said for the last two or three years. And you're talking about just of our move in. So, when you think about the number of units with turnover and all that, it's a relatively -- it's significant in terms of it's picked up, but it's still -- it's not driving the bulk of our demand or the bulk of our outperformance.
Aaron Hecht: Great. And then on the property management technologies savings initiatives. Just wondering, are you guys taking property managers off of the property? Are they responsible for more than one to maybe there are managers there all the time? Some of these managers are changing in that format. I'm wondering if that's something you guys are looking at?
Tim Argo: Yes, we are testing and looking at some, if you want call it, pods or whatever, where we have some oversight roles at managing multiple properties, particularly ones that are within close proximity and with the new CRM we have in place that's helped enable that. And there's some other things we're looking at that will help enable that. But yes, and we talked about that a little bit on the last call. That's something that we're actively engaged in right now.
Aaron Hecht: Appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator: And we will take our final question today from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Anthony Powell: Hi, good morning. A question on the multifamily development, redevelopment, I guess, one of your peers said that they are maybe pulling back on that next year due to some uncertainty and some timing. Just curious what you are you going to keep your schedule in terms of redevelopment next year? And are you still seeing kind of the returns that you expect in the October end?
Brad Hill: Yes, this is Brad. So we've got, as I mentioned earlier, a number of properties between four to six that we can start next year. Those will probably be weighted mid to late next year is my sense. So we've got a little bit of time on those really to kind of figure out where the market is. And frankly, just to see if there's some reset on the construction cost side of these projects. So we've got some time under our belt from that. But as I mentioned in my comments, we have the ability to be patient on those. -- and the discipline that we use to help us find sites and really underwriting our deals will also be the same discipline that we use in determining when we -- when is the right time to start construction on these assets. So, I'd say it's a little early right now to tell if that will push off at all. We do have the ability both from a timing perspective and then just also the balance sheet capacity to be able to hold those assets if we need to those land assets.
Anthony Powell: Maybe one more for me. In terms of -- what are you seeing in terms of land cost for new developments? I know you talked about cap rates and how those are moving? How are land costs trending? And how is that impacting your ability to do deals?
Brad Hill: Yes, I mean, land is probably the last component to adjust if there's an adjustment on the development side. construction costs, that takes a little while to manifest itself into the cost of the project and then land is the last thing that adjusts. And at this point, we're not really seeing any adjustment in land prices, and it will just take some time to really see if there's anything to that.
Anthony Powell: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call to MAA for closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: No closing remarks. We appreciate everybody hanging with us this morning, and we look forward to seeing a lot of you over the next few weeks with upcoming conferences. Thanks a lot.
Operator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MAA Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, July 28, 2022. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.
Andrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Gretchen, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, Tom Grimes and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34x filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the -- Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. Leasing conditions remained strong across our Sunbelt portfolio, job growth, positive migration trends and the higher cost of single-family home ownership continue to fuel strong demand roughly halfway through the busy leasing season, we do not see any indication that demand is slowing. Leasing traffic or leads were up 11% in the second quarter as compared to prior year generating a 7% jump in lease applications, new move-ins during the quarter from households migrating into our Sunbelt footprint increased slightly from last year and drove 15% of our new move-ins. Further supporting the strength of the leasing market and the prospects for continued rent growth, it's worth noting that the rent-to-income ratio of the new leases executed in the second quarter was 22%, it remains in a very affordable range. Collections also remained strong with 99.5% of the rent build in the second quarter collected, which is actually up slightly from 99.4% collected in the preceding first quarter. Al will touch on this and while we see no near-term indications that leasing conditions are poised to change and we expect the strong occupancy and rent growth trends to continue, we do anticipate that we'll see some year-over-year moderation in rent growth over the back half of the year as the prior year performance comparisons become more difficult. But current rent levels continue to hold up well and are increasingly fueling solid revenue momentum for the start of the next calendar year. Pressure on operating expenses from the competitive labor market, inflationary and supply chain pressures and real estate taxes continued in the second quarter. We expect these pressures will likely persist over the balance of the year with some relief beginning in 2023 as we begin to harvest increasing benefits from our new tech and margin expansion initiatives. On balance, given the strong top line performance, our NOI margin continues to expand. And as noted in our earnings release, we, once again, increased our expectations for growth in same-store net operating income for the year. We are seeing increasing opportunity within the transaction market and are very pleased with our Tampa property acquisition completed earlier this month. This new property acquisition is actually located directly adjacent to 1 of our existing properties providing an opportunity to consolidate on-site operations to drive a very attractive investment return. Our new development pipeline continues to expand as we continue to find attractive opportunities to drive value and yields well above our overall cost of capital. Our pipeline of existing construction projects remains on budget, and our lease-up projects are outperforming our pro formas. We remain very encouraged by the current leasing conditions and the early momentum in key variables that will define calendar year 2023's initial performance. There are, of course, growing concerns surrounding the broader economy and concerns surrounding a potential recession. Should we find ourselves facing a weaker economic backdrop later this year or in 2023, we believe that MAA is very well positioned for such an environment. First, we believe that the well diversified and more affordable nature of our markets will continue to enable our Sunbelt portfolio to better weather an economic slowdown as compared to other regions. MAA's balance sheet and coverage ratios are very strong and better than at any point in our company's history. We continue to introduce new technology and changes to our operating practices that will drive more efficiency and higher margins over the next couple of years. MAA has had a established performance record of responding well to down cycles, and I'm confident that we will again demonstrate that resilience, should we find ourselves in such an environment. Meanwhile, our outlook remains positive, and current leasing conditions are very strong. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Brad.
Brad Hill: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Transaction activity in the second quarter slowed meaningfully from the first quarter of the year as the increase in interest rates coupled with a higher degree of economic uncertainty have combined Ascend Buyers with shorter investment time horizons as well as buyers using higher leverage to the sidelines. Unlike previous quarters, we saw a number of properties fall out of contract in the second quarter. For the properties that did close, generally, they closed with stronger institutional quality investors at cap rates that were 40 basis points higher than where deals traded in the first quarter. As the uncertainty in the market has risen, our ability to move quickly and close all cash has led to a significant increase in inbound calls to our transaction team. As Eric mentioned, in July, we successfully acquired a newly constructed property in the Tampa MSA. This 196-unit property is adjacent to an existing MAA property and will be fully integrated into our existing property, creating operational efficiencies and margin expansion opportunities that we will fully harvest over the next few years. Our under construction and in lease-up pipeline remains at $740 million. While we had no construction starts in the second quarter, we did purchase a land parcel for a planned 2023 start of a 300-unit development in Orlando. Also, subsequent to quarter end, we purchased a 500-unit development site in the Denver MSA that we also expect to start construction on in 2023. These land purchases bring our owned land sites for development to 8 sites with entitlements for approximately 2,677 units. We previously expected to start construction on our sites in Raleigh, Tampa and Denver this year, but we've pushed the start of our Denver project to 2023. Predevelopment work on our Raleigh and Tampa projects are progressing and subject to receiving acceptable construction costs and the appropriate building permits, we still expect to start construction on these projects this year. We continue predevelopment work on several additional in-house and prepurchase developments located in Atlanta, Charlotte, Denver, Orlando and Salt Lake City that we hope to start over the next 18 months. The timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and the construction bidding processes but at this time, we expect to start construction on approximately 1,250 units this year, and we expect to end the year with a pipeline of under construction projects over $700 million and pipeline of projects both under construction and in lease-up between $925 million and $975 million. Our construction management team continues to actively manage all our projects and has done a tremendous job working with our contractors to keep the inflationary pressures surrounding labor and material costs from causing a meaningful increase to our overall job cost. To avoid the cost escalation that is so prevalent in the market today, we are making commitments to purchase materials much earlier in the process than we've had to in the past. Nevertheless, delivery delays, material shortages and securing building permits remain our biggest challenges. In our supplemental, we did push back by 1 quarter, our expected delivery dates on Novel Val Vista in Phoenix and Central Park in Denver. Operating performance at communities in their initial lease-up continues to strengthen, traffic and leads remain elevated, leading to rents well ahead of our pro forma expectations at all of our lease-up communities. Due to the strong leasing performance achieved by our property team at MAA Westland, we moved up our expected stabilization date by 1 quarter to third quarter of '22. As mentioned in our release, we successfully sold our 2 disposition properties in the Fort Worth market for $167 million. We have 2 more planned disposition properties in the market that we hope to close late this year. One is in Suburban Maryland, and one is in the Austin market. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.
Tom Grimes: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Same-store performance for the quarter was once again robust, and our busy summer season is going well. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the second quarter blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 17.2%. As a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth increased by 14.3% on a year-over-year basis and 4% from the prior quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver and with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 95.7. The strong demand environment continues to create new opportunities for our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our smart home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. During the quarter, we completed 1,844 interior unit upgrades and installed 9,438 smart home packages. In 2022, we plan to complete over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and approximately 23,000 smart home packages. By the end of the year, we expect our total number of smart units to approach 70,000. For our repositioning program, we're in the final stages of repricing leases at the first 8 properties in the program that are now complete, and the results have exceeded our expectations. We have another 8 projects that are underway this year. Strong leasing activity continues for July. Same-store lease-over-lease pricing on new move-ins as of July 25, is 17.9% ahead of the rent of the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in July is running 15.4% of the prior lease and as a result, blended lease pricing for the portfolio is up approximately 16.6% thus far in July. Same-store physical occupancy as of July 25 was 95.9. Exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.4%. Both numbers are in line with our expectations. Our teams have performed well during our busy summer season and have the portfolio well positioned for the slower fall and winter seasons. I'm grateful for their time and commitment to serving all our stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Al.
Al Campbell: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.02 was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. The outperformance virtually all came from property revenues and stronger than projected rental pricing trends continued through the quarter, which produced a strong 17.2% increase in blended lease pricing for the quarter even as more challenging prior year comparisons began to grow late in the quarter. We do continue to expect a growing impact from prior comps as we move through the back half of the year as well as a return of a more normal seasonal pattern during the fourth quarter, which we'll discuss just a bit more  guidance in a moment. Same-store operating expenses for the quarter were slightly higher than projected as we saw some inflationary pressures and repair maintenance costs as well as revised expectations for real estate tax expenses for the year as more valuation information came in during the quarter. Our revised guidance for the year reflects these expense pressures, but these are more than offset by growing revenues as reflected by our revised NOI guidance. Our balance sheet is stronger than ever as reflected by the upgrade to an A- credit rating by Fitch during the quarter. We continue to have discussions with the other agencies and are confident the strength will eventually be reflected in our other ratings as well. Just after the end of the quarter, we completed a renewal of our unsecured credit facility, which is our primary tool for liquidity and short-term funding of development, debt maturities and short-term operating needs. As part of the renewal, we increased the facility size to $1.25 billion from $1 billion and capture improvements in pricing and terms despite the growing volatility of the financing markets. At the end of the quarter, we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility, and our leverage was historically low with debt to EBITDA at a low 3.97x and 100% of our debt had fixed interest rates with an average maturity of 8.2 years, providing potential in a rising interest rate environment. And finally, given the second quarter performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased our full year range for core FFO by $0.17 per share or 2% at the midpoint to a range of $8.13 to $8.37 per share or $8.25 at the midpoint. This now represents a 17.5% growth over the prior year. This increase is essentially all the result of higher revenue growth, strong price intends continued through the second quarter, as we mentioned, we're now projecting a 125 basis points increase in our effective rent growth expectation for the year to 13.25% at the midpoint. Our revenue projection for the year continues to be built on strong pricing performance and stable occupancy for the year with some growing impact from prior year comps for the second half and normal seasonal trends during the fourth quarter, as we mentioned. We expect blended lease pricing to be approximately 8% for the second half of the year, which for context is on top of a record high 15% growth in blended pricing captured in the back half of last year. So I think this reflects our expectation for continued strong demand in our markets. As mentioned, we also increased the expected growth rate for same-store operating expenses for the full year by 100 basis points at the midpoint of our range, now 6.5% to 7.5% for the full year, primarily reflecting the pressure in repair and maintenance costs as well as real estate taxes. Property valuations received during the quarter, mainly in Texas, reflected aggressive assessments, and we do expect these valuation increases to be partially offset by millage rate rollbacks finalized late in the year, but we increased our expectation for taxes by 100 basis points for the full year to reflect the net impact. The overall impact of these changes is an increase to our expectations for same-store NOI growth for the year to a midpoint of 15%, up from the 13.5% provided at the end of the first quarter. And this represents a 170 basis point expansion in our margin in 2022 from the prior year. So other changes to guidance of note were a $50 million reduction in our expected development spending for the year, reflecting really revised timing of funding as well as a $25 million reduction in our gross disposition proceeds as we finalized the sale of the 2 remaining properties in Maryland in Austin. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Gretchen we'll now turn the call back over to you for any questions.
Operator:  Our first question comes from Nicholas Joseph from Citi.
Nicholas Joseph: Obviously, rents have been moving up, but appreciate the affordability stats that you provided for the new move-ins. But for the existing portfolio, obviously, you don't kind of requalify them off of income. But are you seeing anything change in terms of move-outs because rent is too high? Or any other kind of commentary on affordability of the existing portfolio would be helpful.
Tom Grimes: Yes. Nick, I'll jump in there. I mean I think looking at a few different fronts, but collections improved to 99.5 from 99.4, which is encouraging. Our unit types, we're not seeing a flight to efficiencies and our efficiency 1s, 2s and 3s are performing consistently. Our headcount units has moved from 1.7 heads to  on that. So it really seems to be moving steadily. I mean we are pushing rates, and we do see a tick-up in move-outs to rent increase. But again, we're moving those folks back in at 22%. So it's pretty steady as it goes, Nick.
Nicholas Joseph: That's helpful. And then as you think about the pricing trends, I guess, year-to-date, but also your expectations in the back half of the year. What does that start to look at in terms of the earn-in for next year in 2023?
Tim Argo : Yes, Nick, this is Tim. I'll hit that one. So thinking about the earn-in. The way we typically think about that is our full year blended lease-over-lease for this year, call it, somewhere around half of that, we would expect to blend into 2023. So If you think about the forecast that we laid out there in the 8% back half of the year, blended lease-over-lease that comes out to about somewhere 12%, 12.5% blended lease-over-lease is what we're expecting for full year 2022. So call it, somewhere about 6% earn-in as we sit here today.
Nicholas Joseph: And how does that compare to kind of the history of earnings?
Tim Argo : It's certainly the highest we've ever had. I think going back to 2020, it was 0 last year, I think it was about 3% or so, so certainly the highest we've seen.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: Eric, you transformed the portfolio for more of a classic focus to a more diversified price point. Should we give an update on what percentage of your portfolio Class A versus Class B? And what part you were able to perform better in consumer recession?
Tom Grimes: John, you're really fragmented. And I think the first question was what's the balance between A and B assets as we look on that?
Tim Argo : Yes. Between A and B, it's roughly 50-50. I mean there are some nuances between what we would call A plus A and B and B plus I would talk about 50-50 or so.
John Kim: And the second part was what do you think will perform better if we head into recession?
Eric Bolton: Well, John, this is Eric. I think that broadly speaking, across our markets and our footprint, I mean, we see that our product is pretty for but that rent-to-income ratio that we see between the As and Bs is pretty consistent across the portfolio. Our collections performance is still consistent across the portfolio. So I think that trying to think that the Bs will maybe do a little bit better than As in a downturn just because it's a slightly more affordable product. But honestly, I don't think there's going to be a huge difference if we find ourselves in a downturn of some sort, I think it becomes more a question about markets that you're in. And employment base, employment diversification. And certainly, I do think that a slightly more affordable product probably holds up a little bit better. But across our Sunbelt markets, we think that broadly, the whole region will just do a little bit better in a downturn as it has historically always in prior downturns.
John Kim: Okay. And my second question is on expenses. You've seen some inflationary pressure expenses higher than your coastal peers. And I realize some of that is just real state taxes. But you made a similar type of investment in technology as you  and had. So I'm wondering if you could comment on the expense guidance going up this quarter.
Tom Grimes: John, you were really broken there something about inflation and expense guidance.
Al Campbell: I think he said also in real estate taxes --
John Kim:  increase on the expense guidance --
Al Campbell: I think a couple of things, and I'll start with this, Tom, and please jump in here. But on the guidance on that, and John, you were broken up, but I think you're asking that. And it's 2 things primarily, which  up a bit. And then real estate taxes, which is obviously almost 40% of our expenses, that's a real big driver of that. And for that picture, particularly, we started the year with no information really, put out our best estimates of it. And we saw the valuations come in higher. They're pretty aggressive as they're coming in particularly from Texas. As we mentioned, we do expect rate rollbacks or millage rate rollbacks come in for a large part of that as it progresses. But we get those late in the year, so it's hard to get a picture of that. And we'll certainly continue to fight like we do every year and we'll formally litigate over half of our Texas portfolio. So that's really the tax pressure. And Tom, you might want to give color on if you have any, but that's out, repair maintenance and taxes both in the quarter and I would say in the guidance as well as one for the back part of the year, probably tilting a little more toward taxes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern: I was curious if you could talk about the plan for the $200 million in equity forwards that were sold last year, I know they need to be settled by February of next year, but it doesn't really seem like there's an obvious need for the capital, especially with leverage below the target range and likely moving lower?
Al Campbell: Yes, I think that's a great question. I mean you hit that right, we have the Ford outstanding to, I think, February of next year. We don't have immediate plans to draw on that, but I think our expectations are between now and then to draw that to help fund the remaining development expectations for this year and as we go into next year. So we certainly don't need to take our leverage lower, but it is a part of our funding over the longer term that we think is important.
Brad Heffern: Okay. And are you guys' comfortable running at sort of like mid- to high 3x leverage or is there a desire to maybe ramp up development or do some net acquisition activity that fuel to get that leverage number back into the 4s?
Al Campbell: I'll give the leverage target and maybe add Brad and Eric will talk on the other parts of the strategy, but we're a little below our range right now. I mean, we've talked about for the last couple of quarters, we always are working to add strength to the business in every area. So on our balance sheet, we're very strong right now. Our leverage is historically low debt to EBITDA may touched 3.97%. That's below. I think we would -- Andrew and I would say between 4% to 5% is probably preferred. 4.5%, you certainly wouldn't want to get above 5% in our current credit ratings. So we're below where we need to be. We believe that's opportunity, both as protection and opportunities. So as we move into this recession and some opportunities come up for Brad and the team, we want to give them that flexibility to do that.
Brad Hill: Brad, this is Brad Hill. I think certainly, we've talked about over the last few quarters, the vision and the plan to grow our development pipeline, and we're certainly on pace to do that as I laid out in my comments and what Al has done with the balance sheet and the really optionality that he has provided us with to be able to do that is there. And I would say just on the acquisition side, certainly, we're keeping our eyes open in that area. And like past disruptions in the market, we've been able to really take advantage of those within our footprint, we have focused on the Sunbelt region of the country for the last 28 years. So we know that region of the country. We certainly have executed both on a transaction side and then operating side for the last 28 years there do all parts of the cycle. So what Al is doing with the balance sheet puts us in a great position to be able to execute on some opportunities, which are likely to manifest themselves during this time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital.
Austin Wurschmidt: So Eric, I'm just curious if you are concerned at all that if we do get sort of an economic slowdown if the migration trends that you've referenced for a couple of years, begin to soften further, perhaps you've had a little bit of a pull forward in demand in recent years. And when you kind of marry that with the fact that the under-construction pipeline in many Sunbelt markets is up. So just curious kind of how you think about that versus maybe the setup for the portfolio and ahead of any prior downturns?
Eric Bolton: Well, Austin, our long-term approach to this business and strategy has long been based on a notion of trying to position for the full cycle, both the down part of the cycle and the up part of the cycle. And we have long believed that the way to do that is to focus on markets where we think that job growth, population growth is likely to be the best over time, over the full cycle, which has caused us to continue to retain our focus on these Sunbelt markets. In an effort to take further cyclicality out of our performance. The other thing that we've intentionally done over the years is that we have purposely been very diversified across the region as well as differentiated capital allocation between large markets as well as some of the select secondary markets of the region as well. And as was touched on earlier, we tend to have a price point in our portfolio that appeals to the broadest segment of the rental market. We don't do the sort of the low end or the super high end. We averaged kind of right in the middle. So we're appealing, if you will, to the largest segment of the rental market. So all that to say that our strategy, we think, has continued to serve us very well for a long time. The migration trends that we've talked about over the last couple of years, of course, they were evident there prior to COVID and move-ins from outside the Sunbelt into our footprint prior to COVID, we're running somewhere around 9%. And now it's up to -- of our move-ins, 9% of our move-ins were coming from people moving into the Sunbelt. Now it's up to 15% of our move-ins are coming from people to Sunbelt. So a long way of saying, while certainly there's been a trend of migration that has worked in our favor. It's not like it's been huge. It's not 50% of our move-ins or something of that nature. It's gone from 9% to 15%. So I think that particular variable of move-ins migration trends, if you will, helpful hasn't been as significant as sometimes what I think depressed and others to make it out as when you read what's going on nationally. Beyond that, I will just tell you that I think in a recessionary environment, if we find ourselves in such a scenario, I think that the diversification of the employment base, the employers, the affordability of the region that we have in the Sunbelt, I think all continues to work in our favor. And we think that today, we very much retain our defensive characteristics that would be helpful to have should we find ourselves in a downturn.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's a thoughtful answer. And then just curious about sort of the acquisition opportunities. I mean you were fairly upbeat when we spoke in REIT. You seem to still be fairly upbeat today and certainly have the balance sheet to fund if the opportunities emerge. But can you size up just what the pipeline looks like today or what you think you can really capitalize on? And then what the negotiations are like for cap rates in your markets versus maybe where it was 6 to 12 months ago?
Brad Hill: Yes. Austin, this is Brad. In terms of cap rates, as I mentioned in my comments, there's definitely been a movement in the last 2 to 3 months. But that movement is very different based on the asset quality, the asset location. And just to keep in mind, really the assets that we're looking at is just a segment of the assets that are out there. I mean we're looking at well-located assets, brand-new assets, high-quality assets. And so what we've seen there is about a 40 basis points change in the cap rates. And what we've also seen, though, is we look at the assets that traded in the second quarter, every asset that traded went to a high-quality institutional capital. So we're seeing buyers certainly flock to high-quality assets, and we're also seeing sellers flock to high-quality buyers. And that's where, in the past, when the markets have changed, where we've been able to find our opportunities through our execution capabilities and through just our 28-year history in the markets that we're in. So as we sit here today, we are getting more calls on acquisitions than we've ever received, frankly, to look at assets that either are fell out of contract or they're just taking to a couple of folks that they know can close the assets. So we're getting a lot of look at assets. And then I think just from an underwriting perspective, the deals within our region of the country just continue to perform extremely well, which leads us to believe that from a performance standpoint, these assets, again, that are very high quality will continue to perform. And I do think that the assets that are coming to market that we're looking at are likely to trade. You mentioned cap rates today versus a year ago. Well, cap rates today on what we're looking at are a 3.7. A year ago, they were 3.8. So we're still under kind of where we were a year ago. So although there's been some recent movement, interest rates went up in the second quarter, they're back down a bit. You can get a 10-year rate right now in the 3%, 4%, 5% range. So there appears to be on the assets that we are bidding against a floor at the moment on pricing for these high-quality assets. There are bidders that are still stepping in into the to 3%, 7%, 5% to 4% cap rate range. So there appears to be a bid certainly for those type of assets. You get outside of that for assets that aren't as well located, have a significant value add. The price differential can be a little bit different, but that's not what we're talking about. So our execution capabilities. Our ability to put our platform value in place on these assets like we're doing with the Tampa asset I think will yield us selectively an opportunity or 2 that we can execute on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC.
Rich Anderson: And just suggestion maybe do the question Q&A alphabetically next time. So the first question is the 22% rent to income. What's the range of that, assuming that there's that assumes though, kind of a 1.5 person per unit type of income? So what's the range of that 22%?
Tim Argo : Yes, Rich, this is Tim. It's a pretty narrow band. I'm going through all of our markets right now. The highest is 24%, the lowest is 19%. So pretty narrowband, most of them in that 22% range.
Rich Anderson: Okay. And then that to lead into my second question. You -- I think it was Tom that mentioned you're having move-outs for rent increases, but you're replacing that with 18% new lease increases and that same 22% rent to income. But is the cadence of that event like a single occupant moving out and roommates moving in. Is that sort of a dynamic that's going on? I'm not suggesting that there's an advance going on in doubling up, but maybe at the margin that, that's what's happening because people who are by themselves are starting to feel stretched?
Tom Grimes: Rich, we're not seeing the doubling up. And that if we look at our head count per unit, it's dropped each quarter since Q1 of '20 really pre-COVID. So we are not seeing signs of doubling up occurring.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Janney.
Rob Stevenson: Brad, with the land parcels that you've bought, how many projects do you now control land for future development on? And what's the ballpark expected cost to develop out those parcels?
Brad Hill: So in terms of the sites, as I mentioned in my comments, we have 8 that we currently own 2,600, 2,700 units. That does not include sites that we have under contract where we have not purchased, for example, the Raleigh site that we look to close later this year that would be an additional site. Our JV sites that we have under contract with partners would be additional sites as well. So -- but in terms of what we own and control right now, there are 8 sites, 2,600, 2,700 units. The costs on those vary a bit. What I have in front of me is about, call it,  a unit on those assets.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. That's helpful. And then what caused you guys to push the Denver development start out?
Brad Hill: Yes. That is really a permitting issue, and that's really what changed some of the funding requirements or needs from development that Al mentioned. Even the Tampa and the Raleigh project that we're working on, really the approval process is taking a lot longer than what we anticipated on all of those projects. So they're generally all getting delayed. What we're finding is these municipalities are really kind of kicking the cane down the road and reviewing things at this point, and it's taking a lot longer than we expected, but that is a permitting delay on the Denver deal.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then, Al and Tom, when you look at the continued spend on the technology initiatives and some of the stuff from an operating standpoint, what's really left for you at this point that's going to make any type of material impact on margins or operating expenses going forward that you already haven't started? And how much more is there to come? Or are we at a point where you've done what you can for now and everything from here is incremental. When you look over the next couple of years in terms of operating margin spend, where is -- what's the drivers and what's the potential impact there for you guys?
Tom Grimes: We've made a lot of progress on our revenue and a ton more to come, and Tim's got a great outline that he'll walk you through on that.
Tim Argo : Yes, I'll walk through and hit a couple of key points, I think, that are important. So I would say, we're in the very early innings in terms of capturing efficiencies on the expense side, really going back to late 2019, early 2020, our initial focus really was on the opportunities with  and some of the revenue opportunities, as you mentioned, and what that could do for us on the revenue side. And then really as well, the key infrastructure that, that puts into place as a result, it integrates with site plan that can help make our service staff and maintenance operations a little more efficient. And then also offer some opportunities from more seamless self-touring options. So I think important to note today, these have been rolled out about 3/4 of our units. And for the full year 2022, there's about $16 million or so of NOI embedded in our NOI stream for 2022. And then by the end of 2023, as we roll out some more, we think there's probably 120 basis points of margin enhancement from the rent increases just strictly on the Smart Home. And then as we fully roll it out, I think it will get fully priced out, probably by about mid-2024, you're talking 140 basis points of margin expansion just related to this piece and $25 million to $30 million of sort of ongoing NOI stream related to that. So now the focus, as we've got that into place is a little more on the expense side. And so I think now with our new CRM tool in process and live across the portfolio, we're focused on some of the efficiencies we think we can get primarily through staffing and task efficiencies. Right now, the new CRM gives us a lot greater access and visibility into properties and prospects, and we're focused on initially on some of the on-site office oversight roles to efficiencies from properties within close proximity, so call it pods or however you want to label it. We think that some of the near-term benefits that come over the next year or so. So when we think about adding, there's about 200 of our properties, call it, 70% of our portfolio that fit into 2 or more property pilot-type scenario. We think that will create somewhere $5 million to $10 million, about 40 basis points of margin expansion as we get towards the end of 2023 just on that piece. And so then we started thinking about beyond the initial pilot scenarios we're working on. We're testing and we're working on and reworking processes related to self-touring, virtual touring, AI technology as well as centralizing and automating some on-site activity. So we think that ultimately creates more efficiencies on the leasing side and other day-to-day tasks. And with our portfolio size, just given the high degree of variability in our assets, mid-rise, high-rise, garden style, some variation, frankly, in the consumer preferences across our markets. In many cases, there isn't just a one-size-fit-all solution. So trying to be thoughtful of that and mindful of that. So a long way of answering your question that beyond the 180 basis points of margin expansion that I mentioned between the Smart Rent and some of the initial podding. We think there's a lot more opportunity to come over the next couple of years.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then last 1 for me. Tom, when are you hitting your most difficult month of year-over-year comps in terms of the blended lease growth?
Tom Grimes: We're heading into it now. We are headed into it now. And Al had the back half, front half split force that I think is pretty telling. I'll let him share that on blended piece. He's just got it handy.
Al Campbell: Yes, I mean we certainly -- in going back to last year, the third and fourth quarters Rob has talked about where the -- when you're leasing the tip of the spear was 15% in the third quarter and 16% blended pricing in the fourth quarter. So those comps are what we're running into and probably July to August is kind of that peak of that heal comparing to. So I hope that answers the question.
Eric Bolton: I think it really is the third quarter will be the peak. And last year, in the fourth quarter, we had a little fall off. We expect -- so it was not quite as high, if you will, in the fourth quarter last year versus third quarter. So I think the third quarter will be are most challenging. But as noted earlier, I mean the July rents, which is obviously the first month of the quarter are pretty good. But as Al outlined in his comments, we expect blended pricing for the back half of the year in total to be 8% that's on top of 15% that we got last year over the back half of the year. And so -- but to answer your question specifically, Rob, I think it's really this month, next month, it'll probably be our toughest monthly comps.
Rob Stevenson: And then has anything changed since pre-COVID in terms of the amount of leases rolling in the fourth quarter? Are you still at a fairly consistent level -- so it's still a fairly light role in the fourth? Or have you allowed more leases to roll then since it's been better of late?
Tom Grimes: We've been quite disciplined on that, Rob, and that can get you into trouble in the fourth quarter, and our lease expirations remain on target with a drawdown in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Powell from Barclays.
Anthony Powell : Question on some of your more tech and biotech focused markets like Austin and Raleigh. Have you seen any decline in traffic in those markets? Or do you expect to see any weakness there given some of the job now since we've seen in those sectors?
Tom Grimes: Yes. We have not on those 2 sides, particularly. And a large part of it is because of the ongoing tech transition that's occurring. So -- and just picking Austin, you've got Tesla opening its Gigafactory that's on. And so hiring is up in that area. And then Raleigh, Apple's building a large campus there and bringing on jobs. And those are just the headlines. But I think the Sunbelt still continues to benefit from the tech companies reallocating jobs across the country. So we're in pretty good shape in those 2 markets right now. And rent increases are fabulous there.
Anthony Powell : And you talked a lot about how rent to income levels are consistent even as you raise rents so much, the incomes are going up. Over the long run, does that raise the risk of more move-outs to home ownership as you have maybe a more affluent renter base that may speak that out over the long run?
Tom Grimes: No. You would -- the thing to keep in mind is that what's going on with the homeownership rates over time, and that has grown at a faster rate than our rents have. And at this point, with the higher incomes coming in, I'm not sure we've seen move-outs to home buying at a lower point than the percentage that they are right now.
Eric Bolton: And I'll also add that what's been interesting to watch play out as well over the last 2 or 3 years is how the demographic of our renter profile has continued to evolve, continues to become increasingly single, continues to become increasingly female. And frankly, it's a demographic that wants the lifestyle that we're offering our communities as opposed to a single-family lifestyle. So we do not see any early concerns developing that should we find ourselves in a very affordable single-family housing market that we're at any sort of material risk from what we normally are in terms of move-outs associated with home buying.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: Just wanted to go back to the question on the Sunbelt. I appreciate the 9% versus 15% move-ins from outside to Sunbelt now. But if you think about -- I guess the question is, when you think about your total Sunbelt, are you saying that in your -- in the Sunbelt markets that you guys operate, the inbound migration is not as big of an impact overall? Or you're seeing in your portfolio, you guys tend to pull a lot more Sunbelt based residents while the overall markets that you operate in tend to benefit a lot from inbound migration? I'm trying to differentiate whether MAA's experience with inbound migration is representative of the market or more how you guys are positioned within your markets?
Eric Bolton: Alex, that's a good question. Honestly, I don't know the answer to that. I mean, obviously, the 9% to 15% metrics that you were talking about and sort of the move in traffic that we're seeing from outside the Sunbelt into our markets, it's only based on what we are actually seeing at our properties. And so it may be that when you look at other sort of broader market statistics that are published and reported on, it may in fact be, if you will, some higher level of migration trend that has been occurring than the 15% that we're alluding to that we saw in the second quarter. But I think that -- and obviously, a lot of the migration that's happening out of the coastal markets into the Sunbelt. I think there's been a lot reported on that. A lot of these people that are moving are fairly affluent households. And more likely than not, I would tell you that I think that a lot of the households that are relocating given that affluence are probably going into single-family homes. And to some degree, as we see single-family home pricing in markets like Atlanta and Nashville going through the roof, it is people coming from outside the Sunbelt homeowners outside the Sunbelt coming into the Sunbelt and wanting to be homeowners in the Sunbelt. So there probably is some level of differentiation there. But the point that I was trying to make earlier, which I certainly think you touched on is that the notion that we are, at least, within our portfolio that we've been somehow way outside -- captured a significant outsized benefit to relocations from the outside of Sunbelt. I think that, that's been a bit overstated. For us, it's only -- it's still only 15% of our move-ins. And as compared to 9%, as I said earlier. And so we're still seeing a significant amount of the leases that we're executing on and the vast majority are from people just moving around within the Sunbelt, if you will.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question. On the market disruption that you guys discussed early on the call, and many of my peers have asked about on the cap rates, you said up 40 bps buyers or sellers want more, the better sponsors. Just to be clear, this is really fall out from levered buyers stepping away and such that when you look year-over-year, cap rates really aren't changed. So as that process come up off the market? Or are you suggesting that it's beyond that, like more deals are unwinding simply regardless of whether it's a levered buyer or not simply because of the macro interest rate, pick your favorite  of the day. I'm just trying to understand whether you're specifically talking to levered buyers pulling back in the fallout or if this is a broader fallout in the market on transactions?
Brad Hill: Yes, this is Brad. One thing I would say is that there's not a ton of transaction data at this point. So I think, frankly, there's not a lot on the market right now. And I think as we get into the third quarter, we'll certainly start to see more data points. But what we're seeing today, it appears that the majority of the fallout to use your term is related to the higher levered buyers pulling back and buyers with shorter-term time horizons pulling out of the market. And those are impacting a certain type of asset class. They're not as impactful the stuff that we are looking at. We certainly hear in the market that cap rates are off 75 to 100 basis points. So we're not seeing that at this point out. Clearly, certain assets that are not well located or have some type of inherent issue with them. You could certainly see that. But we're not seeing that at this point. And based on the fact that every deal that we saw that closed in the second quarter was with institutional quality capital tells us that there's still a demand by institutional capital for well-located assets and the cap rates have moved a bit, but they have not moved tremendously. And they're still down from where we were second quarter of last year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chandni Luthra of Goldman Sachs.
Chandni Luthra: So with day-to-day inflation on commodities, food complex, gas prices. Could you talk about what you are seeing, if any impact on your residence? Has the discussion in negotiation level of negotiation gone up on renewables, just given more pressure on day-to-day expenses for some of your tenants perhaps?
Tom Grimes: Chandni, it's Tom. And the level of negotiation, if you will, in terms of the feedback that we get from residents began to go up last year as renewal increases went up last year. We negotiated well less than a percentage point on our renewal offers. In fact, it's like 20 basis points. That has not changed over time. And the renewal accept rate has continued as it has pretty historically high and turnover staying flat. So we're getting -- we get questions about it, but we have not needed to adjust our renewal rates. And so very little push -- I mean, excuse me, pushback in that area. But when they get out in the market and they look at what our new lease rate is, which is still $100 higher than our average renewal rate. They kind of see that they're priced fairly and accept the rate and move on.
Tim Argo : And Chandni, it is Tim. I think a point worth noting, if you look at some of our B assets or little bit lower price point assets. We actually have seen pricing performance do a little bit better in the last couple of quarters on those assets. So arguably, those would be the ones that might feel a little more pressure and we just haven't seen it from a pricing standpoint?
Chandni Luthra: Got it. And if I could get a quick follow-up, please. In terms of the development pipeline, how has the inflationary environment, supply chain, permitting delays that you talked about impacted yields, if you could give us some mathematical color around that, please?
Brad Hill: Yes. I would say that just municipal delays and those type things is not having much of an impact at this point on our overall yields. Certainly, in the last 6 months, we have seen a tremendous increase in cost escalation very acute the last 6 months, I'd say. But we are starting to see early signs of that cost escalation alleviate a bit. Certainly, some of the commodity prices are down, lumber is down just given that the single-family construction is off a bit. So from where we sit today, it looks like going forward that the cost escalation that we are seeing will start to mitigate itself. I don't think cost go backwards, but I think the rate of increase will substantially slower. It looks like it will substantially slow. And then you couple that with we're seeing on the rent side and our yields are actually holding up pretty well from those delays that I just talked about.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse.
Tayo Okusanya: Most of my questions have been answered. But just a quick one. I mean you did mention earlier on that the resident base is increasingly turning single, increasingly turning female. I'm just curious how that is impacting how buildings are designed going forward, whether it's unit mix and kind of what implications that could have for development costs going forward? And also, if you could kind of throw in any ESG considerations as part of that answer.
Brad Hill: From a development aspect, frankly, we haven't changed a whole lot relative to that. I mean, other than our amenities to take into account pets has increased substantially. So I'd say that would be one thing that certainly has changed. And then just broadly, I think the desire for meeting spaces in common area spaces where folks -- whether -- no matter what demographic it is, where folks can gather and just be in community with the other folks of the complex has certainly grown, and we're spending a lot of time on that. But other than, I would say, the pet areas that we've had to spend more design attention and paid more design attention to, there hasn't really been a whole lot of change associated with the demographic change there.
Eric Bolton: Tayo, and what I would say, over a longer period of time, longer horizon, I think that what has changed about the product in general, and it was a change in response to this demographic shift, but I think the demographic shift that you alluded to is finding it attractive and that is structured parking, interior hallways, I think it's also been 1 of the reasons why our Smart Home and  technology has been so embraced. It just -- it provides a certain degree of privacy that I think people really appreciate. And get out of the weather elements a little bit more with the interior hallways and the structured parking deck. So I think those things have continued to really find great receptivity this demographic shift that we've mentioned, and I think it will continue to do so going forward.
Tim Argo : Tayo, this is Tim. To hit on your ESG point. Our ESG group works closely with our development group and we've kind of historically built at least a broad standard in terms of green building certification. We're evaluating that and along the ones we've done recently for silver, even golds and -- so we're definitely thinking about in our underwriting, kind of considering what makes sense, but from a resident perspective and from our perspective as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.
Unidentified Analyst: It's  on for Nick. Most of my questions have been answered a lot of great detail. Just a quick 1 for me, and I apologize if you answered this, but what is the assumed split between new renewal embedded in the new guide? Is there an expectation for like a divergence through the end of the year in '23?
Al Campbell: This is Al. Just some color on that. I mean, certainly, as we talked about, as Eric mentioned, 8% over the back half of the year, there is a little bit lower expectation for the fourth quarter because that's 1 of the seasonality that we talked about would kind of begin because of the holiday season. So -- but in general, what we've built on is renewals continue to be the strongest I would say, in double digits, probably lower double digits, likely in that range with new leasing, which tends to feel the most pressure of probably both comps as well as certainly seasonality being in single digit by mid-single-digit range, and that's sort of the estimate for the back half of the year that you can roll in.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And then what are the main drivers of the components of the OpEx guidance increase? I know you mentioned real estate taxes are roughly 4% to 5%. So just wondering what's increasing the rest of that 6.5% to 7.5%?
Brad Hill: In general, it's -- for the increase for the quarter 2 components, primarily really repair and maintenance as well as taxes. We talked about taxes. And so -- and so I'll talk about repair and maintenance really is more just cost of materials, HVAC costs because it's been a hot summer as well as this is a month of our highest turnover by design as we have more of our units, we pushed most of our turnover in the summer months because that's when the demand is there. So that pressure is being built there a bit, and we're not seeing that -- I don't expect that to dissipate significantly or the back half of the year at this point. Some of the things Tim mentioned will help us going forward. But really repair and maintenance and taxes were the reasons for that change.
Operator: Our next question comes from  from Green Street.
Unidentified Analyst: Brad, I was just wondering if you could share pricing expectations for the incremental dispositions that you're guiding to through year-end? And then on top of that, too, if you could touch on the just of those assets that you're marketing and considering marketing that would be great.
Brad Hill: Yes. So I think I mentioned it in my initial comments. The 2 that we look to bring out or have on the market right now. One is in suburban Maryland, and then one is in Austin, and these are 20 -- on average, 25-year-old assets that we look to bring out. So in terms of pricing expectations on those, for the entire set -- for the year, we expect to achieve a, call it, a 4% to 4.5% yield on those assets. And the way we look at that is an NOI yield and 1 of the things that is having an impact on our yields there is specifically the asset in Suburban Maryland. That's an asset that has had some challenges in a number of ways. One, specific to the asset, it has a right of first refusal that the county there has where they can step in and buy the asset, they have the right to match any offer that you get. Normally, that's not a big deal, but they did recently take advantage of a  they had on another asset nearby. They have not done that in years. So obviously, the buyer pool is well aware of that. So they're more reluctant to spend a lot of time on an asset going through due diligence because what they have to do is go under contract on the asset and continue to their due diligence, but at any time during that period, the county can roll for the product. So we're seeing a little bit of an impact associated with that. We also have on that asset some regulatory issues, which recently rolled back, but it has impacted the performance renewal cap increases and things of that nature. So that is impacting the pricing of that asset, which is driving our overall returns a little bit off on those dispositions from what we would normally expect.
Unidentified Analyst: I appreciate the color there. And Tom, are you noticing any pickup in concessions in any of your more heavily supply markets that other operators might be using to drive up demand?
Tom Grimes: No. The concessions have really not been heavily used and where we see them is really only in the pockets where they're not really being used to drive excess demand on a stabilized asset, but you see them use from time-to-time on new lease-ups. But we're not having to compete much with those at this point just because our demand level is good, and concessions are less than 0.4% of our net potential right now.
Operator: And our last question comes from Barry Lu from  Group.
Unidentified Analyst: I was -- my first question was on the expense side. Could you -- I think you mentioned 180 bps of margin expansion from technology investments in your platform. Do you know how much of that expansion is coming from expense versus top line revenue growth?
Tim Argo : Yes. For the specific 180, about 40 or so of that is related to expense and the rest is revenue. And then that's just what all we've identified for now, or we think there's some further opportunity on the expense side in the next couple of years.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And also, are you concerned about turnover at all? And how much more are you willing to push pricing the capital more of your loss to lease? And also, do you know what the loss we see?
Tom Grimes: Turnover at 45% on a 12-month rolling basis is very good and low, sort of the lowest I've seen in my career, and we feel very good about the opportunity for pricing going forward and still believe now is the time to push rate versus volume. So we'll see a seasonal slowdown and tougher comps, but demand is good and our priority is for growing rents.
Unidentified Analyst: And sorry, you mention what your loss lease was?
Tim Argo : Yes. On the loss lease, if you look at our June blended rents compared to where our whole portfolio sits, it's about 8% or so. If you look at just new leases, it's about 11%, but we would typically expect that to be the highest right now. This is sort of the peak season, but that's where it stands right now.
Operator: We have no further questions. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: Well, we appreciate everyone being on the call and hanging there with us. And obviously, feel free to reach out back to us at any point if you have any other questions you'd like to ask. So thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's MAA First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, April 28, 2022. I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments.
Andrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, Tom Grimes and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Andrew, and we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. MAA continues to capture robust leasing conditions across our portfolio, and we are carrying strong momentum in rent growth into the summer leasing season. Leasing traffic remains high, solid job growth, accelerating migration trends to our Sunbelt markets and the higher pricing hurdles for single-family ownership continue to fuel strong demand for apartment housing. Almost 14% of the new leases we wrote in the first quarter came from move-ins relocating to the Sunbelt. This is an increase of 190 basis points from the first quarter of last year. Resident turnover continues to remain low with move-outs further declining by close to 6% as compared to Q1 of last year. These trends continue to support our ability to capture strong rent growth. The rents in place at quarter end within the same-store portfolio were on average 12.4% higher on a comparable basis to the prior year. And encouragingly, the new leases that went into effect in the first quarter were 16.8% higher than the expiring leases. Pricing momentum remains strong heading into the important summer leasing period. Our largest pressures on property operating expenses were with personnel costs and repair and maintenance expenses as the tight labor market, inflationary pressures and supply chain issues make an impact. But with the strong top line performance, we continue to see strong NOI growth. And as detailed in our earnings release, we have increased our performance expectations for the full year. Our new development pipeline continues to perform very well with 5 of the projects now actively leasing and capturing rents that are higher than assumed in our projections. As detailed in the earnings release, we have 3 other developments under construction that we expect to start leasing late this year. In addition to the development detailed in the earnings release, we are also expecting to break ground on another 3 projects later this year located in Raleigh, Tampa and Denver. We're excited with the strong start to the year. Leasing conditions clearly remain very favorable. We have a number of initiatives underway with new technologies and redevelopment that will further fuel margin expansion and higher earnings growth from our existing portfolio and expanding new development pipeline will add -- will also fuel additional FFO growth over the next 2 to 3 years and the balance sheet is in a strong position to support our growth plans. MAA strategy has consistently demonstrated more resilient performance during weaker parts of the economic cycle. But as a consequence of the many enhancements we've made over the past few years to the portfolio mix, to the operating platform, to the balance sheet and to our external growth capabilities, we're excited to now also see MAA's ability to post strong relative performance during recovery and the up parts of the market cycle. In closing, I'd like to extend my appreciation to our team of MAA associates for their continued hard work and consistently strong performance. I thought I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Brad.
Brad Hill: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, we continued to make progress towards growing our new development pipeline. We finished the first quarter with $444 million under construction and $740 million combined under construction and in lease-up at an average expected stabilized NOI yield of 5.9%. The size of our total pipeline is up from $700 million at the end of 2021. During the first quarter, we started construction on a 352-unit project in Denver called MAA Park Central. This is the first phase of a 3-phase 1,000-unit project on land we purchased in late 2020. Predevelopment work at our 3 young sites in Raleigh, Tampa and Denver is progressing. And subject to receiving acceptable construction costs, we expect to start construction on these projects this year. Additionally, we continue predevelopment work on several in-house and prepurchase developments that we hope to start over the next 18 months in Atlanta, Charlotte, Denver, Orlando, Phoenix and Salt Lake City. This pool of future development opportunities includes an entitled site in Denver that we purchased in the first quarter of this year. The timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and the construction bidding processes. But at this time, we expect to start construction on 1,600 to 1,800 units in 2022 and end the year with a pipeline of under-construction projects between $800 million and $900 million and a pipeline of total projects both under construction and in lease-up over $1 billion. Our operating performance at communities and their initial lease-up is strong, and we're achieving rents substantially above our pro forma expectations. Reflective of the strong leasing demand in our markets, we reached stabilization at our MAA Midtown Phoenix community 2 quarters earlier than our original expectation, while also achieving stabilized effective rents more than 7.5% above our original pro forma expectations. Our construction management team continues to actively manage all our projects and has done a tremendous job keeping labor and material cost increases from having an impact on our overall budgets. Material shortages and shipping delays are prevalent in the market today. And in many instances, necessitate us placing orders and making deposits much earlier in the process than we had to in the past to secure materials as well as our place in the delivery queue. Despite these challenges, we delivered our last units at both MAA  and MAA Park Point on time during the first quarter. Our 2022 disposition plan is underway with 2 properties in the Fort Worth market currently under contract with an expected closing date later in the second quarter. Buyer interest was strong for these 30-year-old properties with one buyer winning the opportunity to purchase both. We plan to sell 2 additional properties later in the year. Our transaction team also remains engaged in the transaction market, and we're actively evaluating several acquisition opportunities, and we continue to believe that as we get later in the year, more compelling opportunities for acquiring stabilized and lease-up properties are likely to materialize. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.
TomGrimes: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Performance for the quarter was once again robust, and we're off to a good start in 2022. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the first quarter. Blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 16.8% as a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth increased 12.4% on a year-over-year basis and 2.6% from the prior quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver. And with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 95.9%. The strong demand environment continues to create new opportunities for our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our smart home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. At quarter end, we have completed 1,098 interior unit upgrades and installed 11,018 Smart Home packages. In 2022, we plan to complete over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and approximately 23,000 Smart Home packages. By the end of the year, we expect our total number of smart units to approach 71,000. For our repositioning program, we're in the final stages of repricing leases at the first of 8 properties in the program that are now complete, results have exceeded our expectations of another 8 projects that are underway this year. The strong leasing activity continues into April. Lease-over-lease pricing on new rent leases for April is currently at 16.5% ahead of the rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in April is running 16.7% ahead of the prior lease. And as a result, blended lease pricing for the portfolio is up 16.6% thus far in April. Average daily occupancy for the month of April is currently strong at 95.7%. And exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 8.5%. Both numbers are in line with our expectations and support our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth headed into the busy summer season. Our teams are well prepared and looking forward to the busier summer season. I'm grateful for their time and commitment to serving all of our stakeholders. Al?
Al Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $1.97 was $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. And virtually all of the outperformance came from revenue growth as rental pricing, occupancy and collections all combined to produce 150 basis points of outperformance to our revenue expectation for the quarter. As Tom outlined, pricing trends continue to be strong through the first quarter and into April, as both new leases and renewals becoming effective during the quarter through solid double-digit growth over the prior lease. We continue to expect stable occupancy and strong rent growth through this year and with some impact from prior year comps and returned to more normal seasonal patterns during the fourth quarter leasing season, which did not occur last year. Overall, same-store operating expenses were in line with expectations for the quarter, but we do expect continued inflationary pressure over the remainder of the year and particularly in personnel and maintenance costs, which I'll discuss just a bit more in a moment. Our balance sheet remains in great shape, providing both protection for market volatility and capacity for strong future growth. We funded approximately $43 million of development costs during the quarter towards trajected $250 million funding for the full year. As Brad mentioned earlier, we expect to start several new deals this year and early next year, likely expanding our total construction pipeline to between $800 million to $1 billion by year-end, which remains well within our risk tolerance limits. We ended the quarter with low leverage. Our debt to EBITDA had a record low 4.27x, with virtually all of our debt fixed and well laddered over an average of 8.4 years and with $1 billion of combined cash and borrowing capacity remaining under our line of credit. Also during the quarter, Moody's affirmed our debt rating of Baa1 and revised their outlook from stable to positive, bringing all 3 rating agencies now to a positive outlook. And this certainly reflects the strength of our balance sheet and the potential for upgraded ratings over the next several quarters. And finally, given the first quarter performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are updating both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased our full year range for core FFO by $0.16 per share at the midpoint to $7.92 to $8.24 per share or $8.08 at the midpoint. This represents a 13% growth over the prior year. This increase is essentially all produced by higher revenue growth expectations as projected to continued strong pricing trends produce a 200 basis points increase in our effective rent growth, our expectation for the year to 12% at the midpoint compared to 10% in our prior guidance and 5.2% for the prior year performance. As mentioned, our revenue projection for the full year is built on continued solid pricing performance and stable occupancy for the year with some impact from prior year comps of the second half and normal seasonal trends during the fourth quarter. The trends with our property operating expenses remained largely in line with our original projections with some increased pressure expected from both from personnel and maintenance costs. The strong labor market, a robust development environment. And the continued supply chain issues are expected to continue to pressure our maintenance service salaries and materials costs. We increased our guidance for total operating expenses for this by 50 basis points at the midpoint to 6%, reflecting the continued pressure. However, it's worth to note, this increase is more than offset by the revenue growth trends, which produced a revised same-store NOI expectation of 13.5% for the full year, which is  above our prior guidance. The forecast for our largest property operating expense line on the real estate taxes remains at 4% to 5%. I'll add also as a result of the continued labor market inflation assumed higher performance-based incentives, given the strong projected performance, we have also raised the midpoint of our total overhead assumptions for the full year. And the only other change to our guidance was an increase in the dollar value of our disposition volume, which was increased $25 million to a midpoint of $350 million, reflecting higher pricing expectations on assets being sold. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Ashley, we will now turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: We will now open the call up for questions.  We will now take our first question from Neil Malkin from Capital One.
Neil Malkin : First question, I just kind of want to touch on immigration trends. I mean, obviously, that's been something that's been talked about for particularly since COVID started. But I was wondering if you can give an update on how those trends are going on either property or market level. Are you seeing those -- that inflow kind of remain steady? Is it increasing from the last couple of quarters in terms of people coming in from out of state? And then the second part would be, are those people from out of state also bringing with them higher average incomes compared to, I guess, you want to call it in-state move-ins?
Tom Grimes: Neil, this is Tom. Just to give you the broad trend for first quarter start and '19, move-outs from outside the footprint were 9.1%; in '20, they were 10.1%; in '21, they were 12%; and this quarter, they were 14%. So accelerating across the board. And then we see places like Phoenix are now 22%, Tampa 18%; Nashville, 29%; 15% Charleston. And yes, we see -- so those trends are continuing and they're coming in at higher salaries as well.
Neil Malkin : Yes. Makes sense. And then maybe I wanted to touch on the acquisition side. You guys have been kind of shying away from that, just given the low cap rates. And now with interest rates going up, I'm just curious about your comment about acquisitions, potentially pursuing some of those in the back half of the year. What are some of the trends that give you confidence that you might have some success there? Is it just elevated deliveries? Is it higher interest rates, maybe reducing competition? Any kind of color on the opportunities you see and why you have some more confidence versus the prior quarters?
Brad Hill: Yes, Neil, this is Brad. I'd say, first of all, we've continued to remain active in the acquisition space for the last few quarters. Certainly, pricing has been very frothy in that area. And so it's really hindered our ability to execute in that area. And we've said the last couple of quarters that we do think that opportunities will increase as we get later into the cycle and into this year. And generally, what we end up seeing is something changes, and something changes to drive the market a little bit closer to us where we -- where our execution capabilities are a little bit more valued. And I think what we're seeing right now is that play out a bit where our ability to execute via speed, where we're able to come in and close on an acquisition within really 30 days. Our ability to close all cash certainly becomes more valuable to some of the folks in the market. And certainly, we're seeing that at this point. We thought that, that would likely be the case this year. And I think just given some of the geopolitical things that are going on, the interest rate movements, as you referenced, are playing out, where we do believe that we'll be able to execute in that arena this year.
Neil Malkin : Does that mean to do with potentially cap rates backing up at all? Or do you expect cap rates to be flat to even compress further?
Brad Hill: We're really early. Interest rates have moved 100 basis points in the last 60 days. And so what I would say on cap rates is for well located, well executed properties. There's really no movement in cap rates. In fact, in the first quarter on the deals that we looked at, cap rates actually went down. Now that's the full quarter. That's likely not the case in March and April, where there have been some folks that high-levered buyers that have paused for the moment. But I would say that instead of getting 10 bids invest in finally, you're getting 4. And the deals that are well located, well executed, are still getting done. So I wouldn't say it's a result of cap rates changing. It's really a result of folks looking to certainty of execution more so than maximizing price. And I would say that where we are right now is bids have been blowing through the top end of broker guidance. Now they're getting the top end of their guidance. And deals are still getting done, especially for the asset types that we're selling and then the asset types that we're looking to buy.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern: Can you walk through where rent income ratios are currently? And any changes?
Tim Argo: Yes, Brad, this is Tim. If you look at our entire portfolio right now, rent income is about 23% that captures everybody that's in a unit right now. So it's gone up a little bit over the last couple of years, but still remaining fairly low and feel like there's still plenty of room to move in terms of our rent performance.
Brad Heffern: Okay. And can you talk about where renewal offers are being sent out currently?
Tom Grimes: Sure, Brad. April is, I think I mentioned, is currently running 16.7%. May in the 17% range, and June in 16% right now. But June's a little early for full understanding. So they continue to be very robust.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc.
Austin Wurschmidt : So I was just trying to understand, I mean, we saw new leases now trending a little bit below renewals in the first quarter and a slight bit, I guess, in April. And you've seen average daily occupancy just now start to tick down here more recently. So I'm just trying to understand if this is a trend that you think you can -- that can persist for some time, or if there's been just now to the point where you're receiving some pushback on the renewal pricing and that may ultimately lead to need to, I guess, bring those down as we move through the year.
Tom Grimes: Yes. I'll tackle kind of the first part of that. And I wouldn't see anything that I would characterize as a slowdown. It is very steady. We're few weeks into April or wrapping up April at mid-16s. And I'll tell you, we've certainly gotten some pushback on renewal increases. But those folks that are leaving for price, we're replacing with someone paying 27% higher. So what we see on this is good accept rates for renewals, both in terms of the number of people that are renewing and the increase. We are seeing closure below and occupancy continues to run in a level that we're very comfortable running in our demand metrics on leads per exposed units are as high as they've been. So short term, we feel pretty darn good about where pricing is.
Eric Bolton: Austin, this is Eric. I'll also add that, obviously, we're just now getting into the peak leasing season and where demand tends to pick up and leasing traffic really tends to pick up. So I think the fact that we're carrying the sort of renewal rates that we are and the new lease rates that we are through the last 6 months of the fall and winter heading into now, the more robust part of the year, I'm feeling pretty good about the trends that we're seeing.
Austin Wurschmidt : No, that's helpful. I guess just trying to understand, I guess, the opportunity cost or turnover cost associated if you're backfilling at a lower rent increase on average across the portfolio.
Tom Grimes: Just to -- yes. And so I think important to recognize we're backfilling, if you will, with someone paying 27% high and total turnover is down 6%. So we're not increasing turnover at this point, and we're repricing at a high rate on those folks that did choose to leave for price.
Austin Wurschmidt : Understood. No, that's helpful color. And so what is market rent growth across the portfolio today? And could you give the current loss to lease.
Tim Argo: Yes, Austin, this is Tim. I'll hit the loss to lease part. So if you look at the blended rents for, call it, March compared to our March ERU, it would imply about 8% loss to lease. You got about $1,600 was our effective rents in March versus ERU of 14.84%. If you look at just the new lease prices where our absolute new lease prices are still running a little bit higher than renewals, it's actually about 10% based on that number.
Austin Wurschmidt : And then as far as market rent growth, just curious where you are year-to-date? And I guess whether anything's changed as far as your projection across your markets for this year that led you to increase guidance 200 basis points this early in the year given we received guidance just a couple of months ago.
Brad Hill: Austin, this is Brad. I'll start with that, and Tim and Tom can add some color if they want. I think what we saw was we had always expected going back to when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year that we would have strength in the first quarter and begin to move into a situation where we have prior comp -- strong prior comps as well as the fourth quarter, some normal seasonal trends impact us that we didn't have last year. That general trend is still in our expectation, albeit the first quarter was just much stronger than we had. I mean pricing came in at 16%, you saw 16.8% for the quarter continued through April, as Tom mentioned, to be mid-16s, the same level. So I think that just went stronger and longer than we thought it would. So it caused us to expect the same continued shape of that curve for the year, given the comps was based, but just moved it up 200 basis points. And everything went up 200 basis points.
Eric Bolton: Austin, I'll add that as I alluded to and Tim or Tom mentioned as well, I mean our move-ins from people moving from outside the Sunbelt into our markets continues to grow. But the other thing that's changed, frankly, in the last 90, 120 days or so is with the change happening on mortgage rates and in interest rates. The hurdles to home buying just continue to grow. And I think that is continuing to fuel some level of demand for apartment housing as well that is running than we expected.
Brad Hill: We do continue to have in the back half moving to a mid-single-digit kind of growth based on those prior year comps and that fourth quarter season we talked about, which is still strong on a relative basis in terms of years past, outside of the COVID period with that's still built into our -- we think we can do that, and we'll just have to see what performance is.
Austin Wurschmidt : Is that mid-single-digit blended lease rate growth or same-store revenue growth?
Brad Hill: Yes. Same store revenue growth will obviously -- will continue -- the math is math. It will accelerate next quarter and stay high through the year just based on what we've done in the last several quarters.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Nicholas Joseph from Citi.
Nicholas Joseph: Brad, you talked about kind of the inflation and supply chain challenges with development. So as you think about the starts for later in the year, how much of construction costs moved, I don't know, either on a year-over-year basis or from earlier in the cycle just as you think of pricing those deals?
Brad Hill: Yes. Nick, this is Brad. So yes, we build into all of our projections, depending on when we expect those projects to start some level of cost escalation, and I would say that varies based on the market. And I would say also that the cost increase that we've seen varies based on market. And I'll tell you, some markets right now are seeing cost increases that are pretty substantial. But I'll also point out that the way that we approach our developments and the way we underwrite our developments is pretty conservative. As I mentioned, we do keep in our underwritings, if we're going to start a project later this year, we've got cost escalation built in our construction costs, but we're also not trending rents until we get to that point. And based on what we're seeing in our markets across the board, there's significant level of rent increases occurring between now or when we put our project under contract and when we ultimately move to construction that we're not recognizing until we get to the point where we start construction. So we're conservative in how we underwrite these, and we do expect construction costs to continue to rise. When we started this year, we kind of expected a construction cost increase of, call it, 8% across the board. And I would say that that's probably increased to 10% or 12% this year.
Nicholas Joseph: That's helpful. And that's kind of my second question, right? So if you think about, obviously, rents have moved up pretty meaningfully as well. So when you blend that together, how does kind of the underwritten untrended deals look today for some of those projects versus when you initially contemplated this?
Brad Hill: Yes. I mean the projects that we have today that are under construction actively. I think we're averaging about a 5.7% yield right now on our underwritten rents. And on those that are under construction, we have construction costs that are locked in on projects that we are modeling going forward. We continue to expect those yields to be in the, call it, 5.25%, 5.5% range. So there is some movement there. But when you compare that to still what we're seeing on the acquisition side, where the yields are 3% to 3.5%. The spreads continue to be in that 150 to 200 basis points range. And so we still continue to believe that taking into account the risk associated with development and the costs and all those things that, that 150 to 200 basis point spread is still a good place for us to be putting our capital.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.
Nick Yulico: Just going back to the guidance on the year, particularly on the 12% effective rent growth. I mean, I know you talked a little bit about this, but I'm honestly still a little bit confused. I mean if you did over 12% in the first quarter, within that, I really struggle to see how blended pricing would be below 10%, mid-single digits, as you said in the back half of the year and how you could still get to that 12% number for the year? I mean just any additional clarity on that would be helpful because it really feels like the blended pricing that's embedded in guidance on new and renewal leases is assumed to be pretty strong over the next couple of quarters.
Al Campbell: This is Al, and I can try to address that, and maybe Tim and Tom can look at it some more. But I think it comes down basically to the fact that it takes our average leases a year. And so if you look at the trends in our pricing over the last several quarters, go back to 2021 and started the year lending pricing at 2.7% and went to 8%, 8% to 15%, 16% in the third and fourth quarter, and then we put another 16.8% up in the first quarter this year. So I think what we're -- though we expect our blended pricing to be impacted by the trends this year, both prior year comps and the seasonal trends we talked about, that strength that we put in for the last several quarters is going to play out for another few quarters. And so I think if you think about our leases in the average year, that math will play out. So I think there's -- what we would expect is that revenue, given the leasing that we've done in the last several quarters will continue to accelerate. It should continue to generate in the next quarter to be pretty strong over the remainder of the year given those mid-single-digit new pricing and blended pricing performance that we expect to put in the back half of the year. So that's how it works out, basically, you got to take in the context of your lease and how that's building up and then winding down over time.
Nick Yulico: Okay. I guess when you're saying that blended pricing getting down mid-single digits. Is that a fourth quarter issue? Or is there any of that in the third quarter as well?
Al Campbell: Now we have to see what happens, Nick. Obviously, what we've projected as a strong second quarter continuing because we started off and so we started off, Tom talked about that's coming in, in the third quarter a good bit just because that's where the really -- if you go back to last year, that's when pricing really accelerated when we took off. So as the prior year comp at the quarter, you feel it. And then the fourth quarter has a little bit of prior year comp plus that season, so it's a little bit lower. So it's both of those, the average together is going to be in that mid-single-digit range for the second half.
Eric Bolton: And the other variable in all this to keep in mind, Nick, is that we're talking about blended assumptions here. But of course, what you see actually play out can vary a bit different between renewal pricing versus new lease pricing. And new lease pricing tends to be much more reflective of supply/demand dynamics going on in the market. But we've, as Tim has alluded to earlier, we've got some mark-to-market or capture to still continue to recover with our renewal pricing. And then if turnover stays low, and we continue to execute a higher level of renewal versus new lease pricing, it can change the outcome a bit. So what Al has laid out is sort of our best guess as to how things will play out over the back half of the year when you do consider the prior year comparisons are a little bit more challenging, and we are assuming a return to more seasonal patterns next year or later this year, which did not occur next year. But that mix between renewal and new lease pricing performance can change a little bit and that can create some variation in terms of the ultimate result we get.
Operator: We will now take our next question from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: I just follow up on that line of questioning. So you're able to push rents 16% to 17% this quarter off a comp period where you had 8%. Third quarter of last year, you had 15%. So shouldn't your renewals be about 10% in the third quarter if market rents don't move?
Eric Bolton: Yes. That sounds low to me for renewal --
Tim Argo: I think renewals is kind of what's -- is where some of the opportunity is right now. I mean we're still in a situation where our new lease pricing is, call it, 2% or so. The absolute pricing is 2% or so higher than the absolute pricing we're getting on renewal. So that's kind of where we -- if you want to call it, return to seasonality, return to normalcies, those renewals catching up and then likely surpassing the new leases. So I do think the renewals will continue to be strong for quite a while.
John Kim: At least 10%.
Tim Argo: I would say so.
John Kim: Okay. Al, what's likely that you get an A- credit rating this year? It seems like your net debt to EBITDA will continue to improve on an LTM basis. And can you remind us what the impact would be on incremental cost of debt if you get that rating?
Al Campbell: John, it's a great question. I think -- and of course, the markets are a bit volatile right now, both rates as well as spreads have gone up now because of some of the concerns about all the factors. But I think we certainly feel good about that deposit. I don't think we need to do anything else in terms of our balance sheet to make that happen. I think what we said is our long-term debt-to-EBITDA range is probably 4.5% to 5%, and we're below that now. I would say we have capacity for growth for some of the things that Brad is talking about. And so I think that we don't really need to do anything to let some time play out. I think there may be our boot would be there a little bit behind on catching up with the strength of the business, but we feel very good about where they are today. So we'll see what happens over the next few quarters. But hopefully, something happens there. We've already -- if you think about it, you should get about a 25 to 30 basis points impact on your borrowing costs say on average, a 10-year financing over time from going from a B to A rating. On our deals that we've done over the last couple of years, quite frankly, we've captured about half of that, John. I think we priced through a BBB+ rating and kind of move into -- almost touched A- at times and we got close. So we've captured about half, but I think we probably pick up another 15 basis points from here in a normal, stable market. The good thing is work that Andrew and the team has done, we really don't have much financing to do in this year. We only have $125 million coming due. So we'll be in the market very -- I don't plan to be in the market, as we talked about. But if we are and the rate income, we expect another 15 basis points increase what we would have been able to do.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: Two questions. First, on the asset pricing and the center pool, I think earlier to some of the questions you said that instead of pricing through the top end, it's now pricing at the top end, and there are maybe a fewer hitters coming forth to buy deals. Does that mean that multifamily is losing its luster? Or is there just a lot more supply out there? Or is the capital that was going to multifamily now going to other sectors outside of, let's say, the classic industrial and multifamily that was all the rage in the past few years?
Brad Hill: This is Brad. No, I certainly don't think folks are going away from multifamily. And in fact, just given the strength of the fundamentals and the broader trends and migration and job growth and things like that in our region of the country, we're seeing as much capital today as we've ever seen in this space and then in our region of the country. So no, it's not that at all. What I think that is, is a couple of things. One is the highly levered buyers are sitting on the sidelines at the moment, just trying to figure out what levers they're going to pull to try to get back into the market. Interest rates have moved so quickly for those folks that they're entering these deals at a negative leverage position, the rent growth that's in place in our region of the country helps them overcome that. So that's really what it is at the moment. It's not a reallocation of capital. It's not capital moving to sectors or anything of that nature at this point. It is simply folks on the sideline at the time being is the first point. The second point is that there has been a flood of projects, deals come to market in March and April. Folks were trying to get ahead of some of the interest rate movements. So there has been a flood of deals that have come to market, frankly. And so I think that part has dispersed the buyer pool a bit amongst these deals. So that's the second component that I would say is limiting the buyer pool on individual deals. But in terms of the entire market, no, I don't think capital has moved away from this sector at all.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is on gas prices. Are you seeing any impact on your residents? There are some people who say, because the Sunbelt is heavy drive and because of lower relativity customers the coastal markets, gas prices are a bigger deal. The offset is most of your residents I'm guessing are single and are probably more concerned about their beer budget than their gas budget. So just curious, if gas prices have any impact on your renters or if it's really just -- I don't let this nonissue, but sort of a nonissue?
Tom Grimes: I'd say it's a nonissue. It's one of many factors going on. And I think when you stack up sort of the different regions of the company or even the different of the country or even our submarkets, we're seeing steady performance in pricing, whether it's inner loop downtown walkable asset or a suburban asset with a drop. So just not seeing much on that on the renter side of things.
Eric Bolton: And Alex, we're also seeing wage growth take place at a pretty robust pace as well. So a combination of what's happening on the employment side and wages, I think, has muted any negative impact on the rise in gas prices so far.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: A couple of follow-ups here. I guess I heard you earlier mentioned that some markets are seeing very substantial development cost increases. I guess I'm curious which markets are those cost increases standing up more so and why more than other markets?
Brad Hill: Yes. I mean 2 that I can think of are Denver and Phoenix and really those are more because they're kind of islands on their own, frankly, in terms of the sub trade base and the GC base. You consider Texas, where you've got Austin, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio. All those markets, contractors really go to all those markets, but that's not the case when you get into a market like Denver and Phoenix, they're more islands unto themselves. So your base of -- your pool is a little bit more limited. So you have a different impact in those markets.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Okay. On the development pipeline overall, you mentioned getting to about $1 billion by year-end that you're still within your -- I think, your comfort threshold. I guess I'm curious how much larger could you be willing to go that pipeline to, especially if you now factor in the rising rates and the supply -- increasing supply projects to come across Sunbelt over next year or 2?
Al Campbell: We talked about in the past, Haendel, that we talk about 4% and 5% of our balance sheet kind of being the tolerance limit. We're well below that now. So we could go -- that's $1 billion to being 4 would be no problem for us given the surface line. Certainly, we're thinking about the marketplace and how things shape up. But our balance sheet is -- our leverage is very low as we talked about how we look at it. We're below our sort of our leverage thresholds right now with plenty of capacity. And so we have only a runway to continue funding in a market that's changing. So that's how we think about it.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Fair enough. And then one more, if you would mind just sharing some updated color on D.C. and Houston to your software market. I'm curious how those markets are faring its expectations coming into the year? And is there any  optimism and maybe pessimism as you kind of think about this market .
Tom Grimes: Haendel, D.C. is now 10.5% on blended rent for April. And Houston is 9.6%. So if we were 3 years ago, I would be telling you how well they were doing, but those are improving. They've improved over time. They probably moved from the mid 4s. It's just that, that still puts them at the lower end of our portfolio's growth rate. So they're improving modestly, I would say.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Anthony Powell from Barclays.
Anthony Powell: So your rental growth and lease spreads have been higher than a single family for the past few quarters, which is good. But in a lot of cases, now some of your monthly rents are converging with single family. So do you see that as a risk as single-family inventory increases? And could that be maybe a potential just headwind as you have maybe larger, I guess, homes available at both semi/full rents to what you're offering?
Tom Grimes: No. I mean there's just no threat at all. In fact, our in-house is, I mean, down 117 move-outs and is now just 3.2% of our reason for move-out. So it's a total nonfactor. And home buying, as you would expect, is down close to 23%. It's now just 18% of our move-out. So the affordability in those areas seems to be driving people to stay, and that's a big part of our production in turnover.
Tim Argo: I might add one point to that, that even with the rate increases we've been seeing, our new lease rates are up about 30% over the last 2 years. But single-family home prices in our markets is up almost 40% over that same period. So relative affordability has actually got lower for single-family than it was a couple of years ago.
Anthony Powell: Sorry, I was a referring to single-family rents, I guess. I was looking at one of the large rental peers and looking at a market like Atlanta or Tampa. It seems like the actual monthly rents .
Tom Grimes: Yes. And to be clear, move-out to rent increase is now down to 3.2% of our move-outs is at 100 basis points lower. So nonfactor there.
Eric Bolton: Yes. I think that, Anthony, it's also important to recognize, as Tom is alluding to, competition that we may have from people choosing to rent a home versus rent an apartment. I mean, it's just -- it's a nonfactor for us, and I think it really is a nonfactor because people are making a choice for renting housing based on a lifestyle need. And given the demographic that we're serving and the demographic that defines our resident profile, these are not people that are choosing or want or desire the single-family lifestyle. They want the apartment lifestyle. So we just do not and never have really seen it as being a problem comparison.
Anthony Powell: Got it. That's clear. And just one more. I guess, one of the multifamily peers yesterday said that they're seeing just older tenured tenants in certain markets like Tampa move out as pricing increases? Are you seeing the same thing? And does that kind of factor into how you price in renewals in any of the markets?
Tom Grimes: And then affect how we price on renewals and our average length of stay has stayed consistent at about 20 months. So we're not seeing a real material change on that point. And we're so consistent with our renewal increases that the renewal people that have renewed, they're not generally that behind, it's more the new move-ins that are getting that higher increase.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Rob Stevenson from Janney.
Rob Stevenson: Average same-store rents $14.69 a month. Where are monthly fees per unit today? And what type of growth rates are you passing through with fees? I assume it's not anywhere near the rental rate growth levels of mid-teens?
Tom Grimes: I mean, no, it is not. And that is -- those run from $100 and $150 a month, and they run more in the 3% to 4% range.
Rob Stevenson: Are you seeing lower application fees given the lower turnover?
Brad Hill: Sorry, say that again, Rob?
Rob Stevenson: Are you seeing any decrease in application fees given the higher occupancy and the lower turnover, so just less units available in your portfolio. And so therefore, you're getting lower application fees that are pushing down fees a little bit in aggregate across the portfolio.
Tom Grimes: No, not materially. And fees are actually up a little bit as we've gotten back to more normalized operating conditions on things like late fees and term fees.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then some of your peers have been talking about earning into 2023. So rental rates continue at current levels at the current trajectory through the prime leasing season. How much it baked in same-store growth is there going to be locked in for 2023 as we exit 2022? I think the peers have been talking about 3% to 4% in their portfolios for 2023 even if rents didn't increase from here. How are you guys thinking about that, the sort of where these leases are going to set you up for 2023 as a base?
Tim Argo: Rob, this is Tim. I'll answer that certainly in terms of the guidance that we have for the rest of the year. The way we kind of look at it is that the blend of lease and release that we expect to get from the full year, roughly half of that should pretty much carry into the next year. So I think I guess a little more than that, I would call it somewhere around 5% now based on our guidance if pricing holds up better than we think, and certainly, that will impact that number as well. So every day that goes by, it helps us in '22, but also sets us up for '23 as well.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then one quick one. How much of your redevelopment is being done by internal MAA staff these days versus contracted third parties? .
Tom Grimes: On the interior innovated, it's primarily a contractor base that's coming in and doing the countertops and cabinetry and flooring in those items. We do a little bit of the paying in-house, but it's primarily a contract process and always has been.
Rob Stevenson: And is that an impediment at this point of getting that labor? Or are you guys still getting as much done as you want to at this point?
Tom Grimes: It's not an impediment at all, much like Brad has outlined in his comments about construction, we've seen some rate increase there, but the price opportunity that we're seeing from the markets is better. And then, of course, new supplies come into our markets, and that's given us additional opportunity to grow it to a higher price point. So there's -- I would say there's some expense there, but it's not affecting the economics or saw in us down.
Operator: And we do have a follow-up question from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: One more development question. One of your apartment peers entered the SFR development business this past quarter doing attached product, I think, in Houston. I guess I'm curious, one, if you have any plans to do so anything in the pipeline that perhaps contemplates an SFR development? And what's your thoughts overall on maybe adding that to your -- that type of product to your pipeline?
Eric Bolton: Haendel, it's Eric. The short answer is no. It's not something that we plan to jump on. We have spent a fair amount of time looking at it. We have studied a good bid over the last couple of years and have ultimately concluded that frankly, we can capture margin expansion and -- from the portfolio and earnings upside, we think, from the existing -- from our operations just through continuing to focus on the multifamily product that we have. And I -- and certainly, the -- some of the things that we're doing with new technology and so forth, which is a lot of it obviously is being used in the single-family space as well. But when you apply it to our more condensed, if you will, apartment communities, where you've got 250 units often with shared structure and much more efficient from a CapEx perspective, we just ultimately believe and have concluded after studying a lot that we're better off to just stick to our knitting and stay focused on the apartment product. And certainly, as we continue to look at ramping up our external growth, we've got plenty of investment opportunity and plenty of growth opportunity, we think, by focusing again on what we really know which is multifamily. So again, the answer is no, we're content to focus as we are.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Chandni Luthra from Goldman Sachs.
Chandni Luthra: What are you hearing these days on the subject of rent control? We've seen increasing dialogue here. We've seen rent margins in Atlanta and kind of with election coming around later this year. Basically, how are you thinking about managing this dynamic? Do you see heightened risk going into 2023 if 2022 was basically, let's say, done at this point from anything material transpiring from a rent control standpoint? .
Robert DelPriore: Chan, this is Rob. I'll start and then maybe turn it over to Tim and Al. But so across our markets, 13 of our states that represent about 90% of our NOI actually have in place state laws that prohibit rent control at a local level. So with that starting as a backdrop to it, it's very difficult to get rent control imposed across our portfolio. So we have a group that is active in monitoring these along with the various apartment associations and trade industries that we're part of. So don't really anticipate any significant impact from rent control across any of our markets.
Eric Bolton: No, I'll add to what Rob is saying is what Tim alluded to earlier, with rent to income and our portfolio now running around 23%, it's still a very affordable level of rent relative to income that we are at right now. And most economists will tell you, once you get to 30% or better or higher, that you start to run into a problem. So a combination of just the environment we find ourselves in, the issues and the fact that a lot of our states we operate really prohibit it, we just -- and the affordable nature of our product and relative to income. We're just not seeing any real evidence that we're at risk of any sort of meaningful efforts towards rent control or regulations to try to keep that in check.
Chandni Luthra: Got it. And a quick follow-up. So earlier on one of the questions, you talked about 2023 in terms of where you are from capturing that loss to lease standpoint, you expect basically that going into 2023, you're looking at a 5% pricing for now. So big picture kind of thinking about where you guys were pre-pandemic. When do you think the market gets back to that 3.5%, 4%?
Eric Bolton: I don't know. I think that it's going to vary a bit by region of the country and by market. From where we sit here today, and I think about the fundamentals that are driving demand for housing in the Sunbelt largely as a function of the job growth that we are seeing and increasing embracing by employers of some level of remote working. And I think that's going to be with us for many years to come. I just -- it's -- I see the demand side of the equation for our business as continuing to be quite strong in our markets for some time. And then I'll overlay on that, the pressures that Brad has been alluding to surrounding construction costs and development and the ability to secure effectively, in many ways, we are at kind of full capacity at the moment in terms of the ability for developers and construction companies to deliver supply. So I think -- I mean, our biggest challenge, frankly, is just the prior year comparisons. It's -- and of course, that will -- we have that this year. And then going into next year, it will be more steady. But I think that as I think about a return to normal from a rent growth perspective, as you're framing it up, it's hard to see that happening over the next 2 or 3 years. I think we're in a very unique window right now where I think the only thing that could change that, the only thing that could really weaken that is if we do, in fact, see the country slip into some form of a recession, and job growth begins to significantly slow and we go into a real downturn in the economy, which, of course, will affect everyone. But historically, of course, MAA has shown the ability to weather those downturns better than most. And again, I think a lot of that comes back to the markets and the way that we are uniquely diversified across the Sunbelt and the more affordable nature of our product. So I think that my answer is fundamentally that I think the conditions are likely to remain pretty bullish for quite some time. And the only thing you can really materially weaken that would be a significant downturn in the economy, a recession, if you will. And even in that scenario on a relative or comparative basis. I like our story in that kind of scenario.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Rich Anderson from SMBC.
Rich Anderson : So speaking of recession, so the GDP print for the first quarter, surprising down 1.4%. How do you -- you speak about some of the protection that MAA has offered in the past about tougher economic climates. But I mean, is there a reason to be thinking out a couple of years or a year about all the good things that are happening today and being careful not to have sort of a hangover when this is all said and done because I might argue that this is not a forever thing. And Karma that you know what? So how do you manage this in light of the broader economic environment and the changes that are going on?
Eric Bolton: Well, Rich, it's a good question. And frankly, it's something we've been spending a fair amount of time thinking about because I do agree with you that -- I mean, one thing we know is the economy is cyclical and our business is cyclical. And I think that while it's hard for me to sit here today and see any reason to get particularly definitive about a downturn. There's a lot of uncertainty out there, and there's changes afoot. But as we think about how do we position the company and prepare for an eventual downturn, there really has always been 4 things that we have really focused our energy and efforts on. One is just the portfolio strategy itself and ensuring that we are focused in markets that we think can weather downturns better than other regions and other markets in the country. We think that the price point that we have in the portfolio relative to others is an advantage to us should we find ourselves in that kind of situation. And as you know, we are a bit uniquely diversified also across the Sunbelt and that we have exposure to a number of secondary markets as well as the larger markets as well. And that balance and that diversification across the region, unique to our story, I think, really is one of the things that we're going to continue to hold on to and to protect as we think about cycling capital and growing the company. The other thing that I would -- we focus on, of course, is the balance sheet and the capacity we have on the balance sheet, and you've now it's a long time, Rich. I mean our balance sheet has never been this strong. We've never had this much capacity. So we think we've got that position about as well as we can. The other thing is we continue to monitor very carefully about how much forward funding obligation we're creating for ourselves through new development. And as Al alluded to, we feel like that no more than 4% to 5% is kind of where we want to be. Right now, we're well below that and continue and certainly intend to stay there. So we -- while we've scaled up a fair amount, we're still in a very comfortable position such that if the capital markets close for some reason, we feel very confident that we can continue to complete all the obligations that we've created. And then the final thing I'll point to, if you were to tell me a year from now that we for sure were going to recession, what would you be doing from an operational perspective, I would tell you we're doing exactly that. This is the time to be pushing for rents. When you get into a recession, the thing that will cause revenues to hold up better than they otherwise would is that you've got baked in performance in your revenues through the rent growth that you've been capturing over the prior year or so. So we think that this is for a host of reasons, is a good time to continue to be prioritizing rent growth over occupancy. And if you want to think about a recession, for sure, that's what we should be doing, which is obviously what we are doing now.
Rich Anderson : Okay. And then second question for me is about an hour ago, you talked about 14% of your leasing came from someplace else into the Sunbelt. But your urban peers are also claiming in migration to these days. So everyone's got immigration. It's a party. It's a migration party. And my question to you is that the 14% of leasing only tells half the story. Because what about the people that did not renew and are leaving your portfolio, where are they going? And so I wonder if you know, perhaps the net is a positive inbound to Sunbelt. I'm not going to argue that. But I wonder if there's -- the back door is opening up a little bit as people perhaps are looking to the urban world and saying, maybe I can get myself a deal someplace else or get a big paying job or whatever the case may be. Is that something you monitor the back door and where people are going, not where people are coming from?
Tom Grimes: Yes. Rich, we do. And move-outs, who moved outside the Sunbelt area were just 4.3%, but less the area, and that's down from 4.5% last year. And it's not big enough that I've spent much time trying to figure out where they're going. So -- and that is pretty big in our favor.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Tayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse.
Tayo Okusanya: My question is more around innovation and technology. Hoping you could talk a little bit more about what you're doing in that area? And ultimately, what kind of margin expansion you expect from these initiatives that may be comfortable that they're all positive MPV projects.
Tom Grimes: Sure, Tayo, and I'll take the first part and kick it over to Tim to cover the margin expansion. But we've -- currently, what has either occurred or is in process as we expanded our call center solution. We've implemented lead nurturing software, which is automated prospecting engagement technology that interacts with our prospects earlier. It allows us to automate follow-ups. We've upgraded virtual touring. We've added a prospect-centric CRM. We've added mobile maintenance and mobile inspections. These changes just so far have allowed us to restructure 30 physicians in the office staff in 2021 that's benefiting us in '22. We're also getting better clarity on billing and higher resident satisfaction as a result of the inspection process. And then underway right now is improved self-touring, improved multi-location sales support, simplified online leasing, and we expect another 30 to 50 headcount reduction in '22, that will benefit '23. And then Tim can talk about -- a little bit about the margin expansion.
Tim Argo: Yes. So regarding the margin, at least for 2022, we're expecting our total margin to go up somewhere between 150 and 175 basis points. Obviously, a lot of different factors playing into that, but a lot of the components, Tom mentioned, are included there. And so smart homes, one, for sure, the installations we're doing there that we can see on the top line. That's probably contributing 40 basis points or so this year to the margin. And then some of the efficiencies on the headcount side, the call center, the automated chat are contributing a piece of that as well. I think some of the foundational things we're doing now with the CRM that's currently getting rolled out and some of the other things that Tom mentioned will have more of an impact as we get into '23, and we'll define that more definitively as we move out to the next few months.
Operator: We have no further questions. I will now return the call to MAA for closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: Okay. Well, we appreciate everyone hanging with us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, obviously, just feel free to reach out to us at any point. So thanks for joining us this morning.
Operator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-03 10:55:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MAA Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, February 3, 2022.  And I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments. Please go ahead.
Andrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, Tom Grimes and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.  Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our Web site at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and audio recording of this call will also be available on our Web site later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. MAA wrapped up calendar year 2021 with strong momentum in rent growth, driving fourth quarter results that were ahead of expectations. The demand for apartment housing across our markets continues to grow. Comparing the pricing achieved on all the leases that went into effect during the fourth quarter on a lease-over-lease basis, rents jumped 16% as compared to the rents on expiring leases. This is 100 basis points ahead of the performance in the preceding third quarter. We are clearly carrying good momentum for continued strong rent growth in the coming year.  As outlined in our earnings guidance for 2022, we plan to take further advantage of the strong leasing environment and drive additional rent growth through unit interior upgrades and more extensive full repositioning projects at several communities. Additionally, we continue a steady rollout of a number of new technology initiatives aimed at further expanding our operating margins. We are just beginning to harvest some of the benefits of our new tech initiatives with 30 leasing positions eliminated through attrition in 2021, and another 50 leasing positions targeted to be eliminated by the end of this year.  Our new development and lease-up portfolios continue to make solid progress with leasing velocity and rents running ahead of our pro forma expectations. As Brad will outline in his comments, we have several additional new projects that we are expected to start in 2022.  The balance sheet remains a very strong position. And during the fourth quarter, Standard & Poor's moved their credit rating outlook on MAA to a positive status. Given the strong earnings performance and robust pricing being captured on property dispositions, we expect to see the balance sheet metrics improve further in 2022.  Our initial earnings guidance for 2022 outlines in more detail our expectations for continued strong performance from our existing portfolio, the expansion of our new development pipeline and our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet.  Following a 9% growth in core FFO per share in calendar year 2021, we're forecasting a 13% growth in core FFO in 2022 at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our team of MAA associates had a terrific year performance in 2021, and I very much appreciate their service to our residents and support to each other.  And that's all I have in the way of prepared comments. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom to update on property operations. Tom?
Tom Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Performance for the quarter was once again robust and those trends carried into 2022. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the fourth quarter. Blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 16%. As a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth increased 10.1% on a year-over-year basis.  Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver, and with current blended pricing momentum we expect it to continue to strengthen. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 96%.  As outlined in the release, we saw steady progress from our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. For the full year 2021, we completed 6,360 interior unit upgrades and installed 23,579 Smart Home packages. This brings the total number of Smart units to 48,000. In 2022, we plan to complete a similar level of interior unit upgrades and Smart Home packages. For our repositioning programs, we're in the final stages of completing work on our first eight properties in the program and have another eight that are underway this year. The strong leasing activity continued into 2022. Lease-over-lease pricing on new move-in leases for January was 15.4%, ahead of the rent on the prior lease.  Renewal lease pricing for January was running 17.1% ahead of the prior lease. As a result, blended lease pricing for the portfolio was up approximately 16.3% in January. Average daily occupancy for the month of January is currently 95.9% which is 50 basis points better than January of last year.  Exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 7.4%. This is 60 basis points better than prior year. This supports our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth. We're well positioned as we move into 2022. I'm grateful for our team's continued resilience and strong performance. I'm excited to see what they accomplish in 2022.  I'll now turn the call over to Brad. 
Brad Hill: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was a record year for multifamily transactions and the fourth quarter was no exception. We continue to see very strong asset pricing trends across our footprint with an acceleration in pricing in the fourth quarter.  Operational performance across our markets is strong, driving continued high investor demand. Bid sheets are deep, with winners surviving multiple best and final rounds and offering aggressive all around deal terms.  To date, we've seen no negative impact on asset values from expected rising interest rates and we believe the tremendous amount of liquidity coupled with continued strong rent growth expectations will drive values higher. We remain active in the transaction market and are constantly evaluating several acquisition opportunities, and believe that as we move further into the recovery part of the cycle, particularly in a rising rate environment, more compelling opportunities for acquiring stabilized and lease-up properties could materialize. New development continues to provide a more attractive investment basis, higher stabilized NOI yield and higher long-term returns to capital as compared to acquisitions. So we will continue to focus on growing our development pipeline.  Our pipeline ended 2021 at $460 million under construction and $242 million in lease up. As we've indicated in the past, the size of our development pipeline will fluctuate due to the timing differences of starts and completions. But we remain focused on expanding our opportunity.  Later in 2022, the growth in our pipeline will be more evident as we expect to end the year with $900 million to $1 billion under construction and $300 million in lease up. Therefore, we expect our total under construction and in lease up to grow from approximately $700 million at the end of 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by the end of 2022.  This ramp up will include in-house developments at two owned sites in Denver, one of which is a three-phase site, an owned site in Tampa, and two controlled sites in Denver and Raleigh. On the pre-purchase side of our development operation, we are in predevelopment on the Salt Lake City site that we hope to start in late 2022.  Performance at communities and their initial lease up is going well. Absorption is stronger than we expected and rents on average are 5% to 13% above performance. Reflective of the strong absorption, we've moved up the expected stabilization date of our Novel Midtown community to first quarter '22.  All of our under construction projects remain at or below our budgeted construction costs, but we continue to see increased and broad-based material shortages and delivery delays. In addition, we've begun to see some level of labor shortages in the market.  Our construction team has done a great job navigating these challenges and minimizing the impact of schedules and the economics of our projects. But this is an area we'll need to actively monitor throughout the year.  We expect these challenges to add 60 days or so to any new starts this year, and we expect a 30-day delay at our Val Vista and Westglenn projects. We've adjusted our construction schedules as noted in the supplemental to reflect the delay at these two properties.  We had tremendous execution on our property dispositions in 2021, selling seven assets and achieving pricing well ahead of our expectations. Our fourth quarter dispositions were sold above our guidance range, generating a leveraged investment IRR of 26% for these 29-year-old assets. In 2022, we will continue our discipline pruning of the portfolio and expect to sell another four properties over the coming year.  That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn it over to Al.
Al Campbell: Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Core FFO performance of $1.90 per share for the fourth quarter was $0.07 per share, above the midpoint of our guidance. Producing core FFO was $7.01 per share for the full year, which, as Eric mentioned, is 9% above the prior year. That performance for the quarter is virtually all from revenue growth.  As Tom outlined, strong pricing trends continued through the fourth quarter. So no seasonal slowdown, which not only benefited the fourth quarter, but provide additional strength for 2022 expectations, which I'll talk about more in just a moment.  In total, same-store operating expenses for the fourth quarter were essential in line with our expectations as some inflationary pressures impacted repair and maintenance costs. Real estate taxes were lower than expected due to favorable appeals and rate rollbacks finalized during the quarter.  We expect some continued inflationary pressures in our operating expenses during 2022, but we expect the impact to be more than absorbed through the continued strong revenue growth for the year. We did provide initial earnings guidance for 2022 with the release, which is detailed in a supplemental package with the release.  Core FFO for the full year is projected to be $7.92 per share at the midpoint of the range, which represents a 13% growth over the prior year. The overall backdrop for our projected 2022 performance is continued strong occupancy levels, remaining between 95.6% and 96% for the full year, providing a foundation support of continued strong growth in effective rent per unit as the strong blended lease-over-lease rent rates continue to work through our portfolio.  Effective rent growth is projected to be 10% for the year at the midpoint, which is nearly twice the total of effective rent growth posted for 2021. This result is based on continued strong blended lease rate growth through the first few quarters with some normal seasonal trends and challenging comparisons beginning to be felt late in the year, particularly during the fourth quarter. This produces projected total same-store revenue growth of 8% to 10% for the full year. As mentioned, we expect to see some inflationary pressures impacting our same-store operating expenses for the year. The personnel costs, repair maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance costs, all trending above long-term growth rates producing 5% to 6% growth overall for 2022. However, this pressure is expected to be more than offset by the strong revenue trends producing an NOI growth expectation of 10% to 12% for the year. Our forecast also assumes an active transaction year with projected development funding of 200 million to 300 million for the year and acquisitions of 75 million to 125 million. We expect a majority of this to be funded on disposition proceeds of between 300 million and 350 million. Our forecast anticipates us starting six new development projects during the year, a combination of in-house, pre-purchase deals, as outlined by Brad, which will increase our total pipeline and funding commitment as we enter 2023.  We currently have no plans to raise additional equity during the year as our forecast projects our leverage to end the year slightly below the current level with debt to EBITDA ranging 4x to 4.5x. Also virtually all of our debt is currently fixed with maturities well laddered, over 8.7 years on average, providing some protection against rising interest rates.  So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Chris, we'll now turn the call back over to you for any questions.
Operator: Certainly. . And our first question comes from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Nick Yulico: Hi. Good morning, everyone. In terms of the guidance, I was hoping you can maybe give a little bit more detail on the 10% effective rent growth at the midpoint. Your blended lease pricing has been trending higher than that in January fourth quarter. So just trying to understand -- I know you talked about some slowing in the back half of the year, but just trying to understand how you're thinking about sort of future market rent growth on top of what you've already achieved so far?
Al Campbell: Yes. This is Al. I could give you some color on that. And as we talked for a little bit in the comments, it's really -- it's based on a strong projection of revenue for sure. But carrying the significant strength of what you're seeing in the fourth quarter end of the year and having pricing of beginning year, as we talked about, move to the back half of the year being impacted by a couple of things, really just some normal seasonality. As we entered the back part of this year, particularly in the fourth quarter, we thought we'd see some seasonality really power through that. It just continued to accelerate in rent pricing. So our forecast is built on continued strong pricing, particularly in the first half of the year, beginning in the back half to feel a little bit of normal seasonality and then hitting those tough comps that we saw from the fourth quarter. So I wouldn't say that we project a weakness at all, we're just projecting a couple of things that come back to sort of normality in the back part of the year. I think that's -- we felt like that was a prudent forecast for the year.
Nick Yulico: Okay, that's helpful. I guess just on the renewal piece of that. Maybe you can give us a feel for, again, you've been pushing renewals at well over 10%. So at what point does that sort of slow down you think this year?
Al Campbell: I'll give you overall, and if some of these other guys want to jump in here. But what I'm saying is first to forecast, we build our forecast often blended, first and foremost, because that's really -- that drives obviously the economic portion of the forecast. And so how it falls out from renewals to new leases where we don't focus specifically on the forecast other than I would say the underlying belief expectation is that you'll see renewals be pretty steady through the year. That's where you'll see the strength continue to market that we're seeing right now continue. If we see the seasonality that we're talking about in new comps, you'll feel that more in new lease pricing. So I hesitate to give too much details there, because we're focused on blended. I think that's the most important number. But that's how we think about it. And we've laid it out in our forecast as you'll see that, those two normalizing factors hit the new pricing on the year.
Nick Yulico: Okay, thanks. Just one last quick one is if you had any latest move-in data into your portfolio from stats from areas outside of the Sunbelt, any markets that that's more beneficial right now?
Eric Bolton: That continues to be the trend. And we saw in 2019, it was 10% and 11%, and now 14%. In the markets that we're seeing, 25% of move-ins are in Phoenix, 22% in Tampa, 20% in Nashville, 19% in Charleston. Honestly, it's just a continuation of the trends we have been seeing and we've been talking about for the last year or so.
Nick Yulico: All right. Thanks, guys.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Nick.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Brad Heffern: Hi. Good morning, everyone. First, could you give the current loss to lease number? And can you talk about how much of the revenue growth you're projecting for '22 comes from realization of that loss to lease versus how much of it comes from underlying market rent growth?
Tim Argo: Yes. Brad, this is Tim. So there's a couple of ways to think about our loss to lease. But if you look at the leases we did in December, for example, the average price of -- the blended average price for December of all those leases was about 1,574. And you compare that to our December effective rent per unit, so all the leases in place in December was about 1,443. So if you do the math on that, it's roughly 9%, recognizing December's only about 5% of the leases. So it takes some time to work through that and get through a full loss to lease. Alternatively, if you base it on our new leases that we did in December, it's a little bit higher, closer to 12% or so. But in terms of what's going to flow into 2022, it's really more of a function of all the blended lease-over-lease that we saw in '21. So 10.7 was our full year blended lease-over-lease in 2021. Assuming the normal seasonality that Al talked about, we would expect half that or so to flow into 2022. So you've got, call it, 5% to 6% of sort of earned in rent price sitting here as of January 1.
Brad Heffern: Okay, got it. And then on the dispositions for this year, obviously the balance sheet is improving pretty rapidly. So I'm curious, why have dispositions at all and why not fund the capital needs with that?
Eric Bolton: Brad, this is Eric. We just think that it's really important to continue a discipline of cycling off the bottom, if you will, a little bit every year, specific properties that we think that either due to the age of the asset or submarket or neighborhood concerns that the outlook for the property is not likely to be as strong as the rest of the portfolio. And in an effort to sort of manage earnings performance and earning stability over a full cycle, one of the ways that we feel like we accomplished that is by having a discipline to cycle off a little bit every year, some of the weaker properties from an outlook perspective. So we think that -- and certainly, obviously, we're getting great pricing today. So we sold seven properties in 2021. We'll sell four is our plan at the moment in 2022. And we think that that effort is just part of our chemistry to continue to compound long-term earnings growth.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Neil Malkin from Capital One. Your line is open.
Neil Malkin: Good morning, guys. Nice job on another stellar quarter. Can you guys please give an update on what you're sending out for renewals in February and March?
Eric Bolton: Neil, renewals are in the mid teens, ranging from sort of 15% to 17% on where they've gone out.
Neil Malkin: Okay, great. And I know that you mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks about how potentially rising interest rates may yield some acquisition opportunities. You've been pretty outspoken about kind of focusing your capital on development, just given the historically low cap rate environment. Do you expect that in some of your markets, rising rates will eliminate some incremental marginal buyers who use a lot of leverage, floating rate to finance the property and can pay essentially uneconomic rates? Is that something that you think will actually come to fruition? Is it more of a market specific thing? Can you just kind of comment on that outlook as the year progresses and rates, at least in the short part of the curve, go higher?
Brad Hill: Hi, Neil. This is Brad. I'll answer that. I would say, we expect as we get later in this year and as some of these interest rates do start to increase a little bit that on the margin, we could see some of the buyer interest in some of the markets that we're looking at could come down a little bit. But I'd say there's so much capital that's out there in the market right now that I think that's really on the margin. I don't see anything indicative on the horizon or from the buyers and brokers that we're talking to, to indicate that some level of interest rate rise would drive a big fall off in pricing. We're not really seeing that. We've certainly seen a run up in pricing. Here in the fourth quarter and also in the first quarter cap rates are really stable, but the underwriting is very aggressive. So we continue to see price increasing. But I think as we -- the operation start to normalize a little bit more, I do think that the run up in pricing that we've seen, the run up in rent growth that we've seen is already priced in. So I think to see another large increase in asset pricing from here on the acquisitions is not likely to come. So I think from a sellers' perspective, kind of the benefit that they're going to get is already baked in at this point. And so from the sellers and brokers we're talking to, certainly price is the most important characteristic or function right now in a transaction. I do think as we get later in the year, that starts to shift a little bit more to some level of strength that we have of execution, all cash closing, speed, those type things become a little bit more valuable as we get later in the year in our markets.
Neil Malkin: That's super helpful. If I could, just a quick one. I've heard some rumblings about some Sunbelt apartment owners looking at potentially single family rental portfolios or assets kind of in their backyard just to sort of tap into that strength and continue to follow the renter through their lifecycle. Can you just comment on that?
Eric Bolton: Neil, this is Eric. We get asked this a lot. I think that for us at the moment, we continue to find ample opportunity we think to deploy capital and achieve some growth at very attractive yields through the physical development and pre-purchase programs that Brad has detailed. And as we sit here today, the notion of consciously going out and really deploying capital in single family rental is not something that really we're focused on doing. I just don't see frankly a real need to do that. As you mentioned, that segment of the residential market continues to attract just enormous amounts of capital. And anything in that area, much like in the apartment sector, is going to be very expensive to execute on today. And we continue to believe that the renter pool, if you will, for our product is still quite significant, growing significantly, quite deep, particularly at our affordable price point. So we think it's better for us to stick to our focus that we have on multifamily and that's certainly what our plans are at the moment.
Neil Malkin: Makes a lot of sense. Thanks, guys. Great quarter.
Eric Bolton: Thanks.
Brad Hill: Thanks, Neil.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nick Joseph from Citi. Your line is open.
Michael Griffin: Hi. This is Michael Griffin on for Nick. I wanted to circle back on the effective rent growth question posed initially. So I'm just curious, how do you get both to the low end and the high end of that expected guidance range?
Al Campbell: I think it would come down to -- Mike, this is Al. And Tim can jump in here as well. It's going to come into what happens with those recent trends from here as you move into the year. What we've got dialed in is, as we talked about, two kind of normalizing factors happen in the back part of the year. We start seeing some normal seasonality to come in and we bump into those comps. And so I think the low end would be -- it would be bumped into that worse than we had projected right now, obviously, where you see, I would say, new lease pricing gets challenged earlier in the year, that is the most aggressive point of that negotiation, or the most challenging part of that negotiation. I think renewals will be stable, but  leases right now. As Tom mentioned, they're going out well. We saw that happen earlier. It would likely push toward that low end. On the other side of that, if we saw that in the environment we're seeing right now that we saw in January, we saw 16.3% blended pricing. If we saw that go for a couple of more months, a few more months, I think we would be talking about the top end of that. So that's really how we think about it. We put the forecast based on recent projection that we would see some of those factors happen. It's certainly reasonable. And so we'll monitor that as we move forward.
Tim Argo: I'll add one point, Mike. Overall, we've assumed economic backdrop of pretty good job growth and supply levels moderating a little bit. So to Al's point, if we had a shock on the job side or economic shock one way or the other, it would be something that might drive the pricing down and push us towards the lower end.
Al Campbell: I'll add one more factor to that Tim and I've talked about it. But one thing we did forecast also, we've done this in the past, is we left ourselves room if you look at the projection for average occupancy, we left 30 basis points below the average of this year, thinking that we want to continue pushing on that price and have a little foot on the gas. So we have that as support, but that's how we think about it, Mike.
Michael Griffin: Got you. I appreciate the color on that for sure. And then just turning to the development side, I know you anticipate 200 million to 300 million spend this year building the pipeline to 1 billion plus by the end of that year. Where do you see that sort of in the near to medium term? And how much more could you see that grow in the coming years?
Brad Hill: Michael, this is Brad. I'll certainly talk a little bit about the near term here this year. We have pretty good visibility in terms of our starts this year. This is a focus that we've had for the last couple of years, really focusing on building out our development capability, our development platform. And we have good visibility on the six projects that we've indicated this year and expect to start those between $650 million to $750 million here by the end of this year. We've got two owned sites in Denver that we should start here in the first half of the year. We've got an owned site in Tampa that we will also start first part of this year. We have a site under contract in Raleigh that should start this year. We've got another site in Denver that we're working on. It should start late this year. And then on top of that, those are all in-house projects, so we have good visibility on those. We're also working on our JV platform. We're in predevelopment on a site right now in Salt Lake City that should start by the end of this year. And then in addition to those, we've got other JV projects that we're working on. And one of the nice things about those is the lead time. A lot of times it's less than our in-house development. So sometimes those can start within the year. So we're hopeful that we can continue to build out that even more than where we are today. But those are the starts that we have this year. Again, good visibility on that and good momentum really in building that platform and the capabilities there.
Eric Bolton: Michael, this is Eric. Just to add to what Brad is saying, I think that with 60 starts this year and the funding associated with that, I would suggest to you that that's probably -- what we're attempting to do is build a process and seek opportunities, either through pre-purchase or land sites that we can acquire that I would view that as our goal is to sort of have a steady state level of funding that approximates kind of the funding that you've seen taking place this year. It would mean depending on the pace of construction and the pace of lease up that our overall aggregate sort of pipeline, if you will, is going to be hovering around $1 billion. And we have said for some time that from an enterprise perspective, we're comfortable carrying up to about 5% of our enterprise value in a development pipeline, which at today's valuation would suggest that we're comfortable somewhere around $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion. So I would tell you that we would expect going forward that you're going to see the pipeline sort of stay around $1 billion and annual funding needs are going to be approximating 300 million or so.
Michael Griffin: Great. Well, I really appreciate the color. Thanks for the time and look forward to seeing you all in Florida next month.
Eric Bolton: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
John Kim: Thank you. I wanted to ask about your optimism on acquisitions this year and how pricing is just getting better. How dynamic are cap rates due to not only interest rate movements, but the NOI growth that's being achieved? So if NOI growth is 15% to 20%, are we going to see a similar amount of increase in cap rates this year?
Brad Hill: Well, John, this is Brad. Based on the numbers that we're seeing, it looks to us like forward cap rates are pretty constant. They're hovering around that low 3% range right now. But what we're seeing is, as you mentioned, the rent growth and the underlying NOI growth that's being underwritten right now is in that -- it can be 15% to 20% depending on the market, which is really driving the value growth at the moment. So I think cap rates are going to be pretty steady where they are right now. I think the question is just what are folks going to underwrite on the NOI growth perspective. And that's very aggressive from where we sit today. And certainly based on the amount of liquidity that's in the market from some of the folks that we're talking to in the markets, some believe that cap rates go down from where we are today. I don't know if that's true or not, but certainly values appear to be increasing at a pretty rapid pace right now based on the underlying fundamentals.
Eric Bolton: And, John, this is Eric again. The thing I will tell you about why I think there is reason to believe that there may be better buying opportunities ahead is that when we see -- been through these cycles before and typically what happens is that as you get later into the recovery cycle, what you begin to see our sellers or developers capital is looking for a little bit more certainty for close. Particularly you see this happen towards the end of the year where contracts that have been -- our properties had been previously under contract fall out and they have year-end closing mandates, and therefore going to contract with someone like us who they know can be an all cash buyer, not subject to any kind of financing risk, and a very good track record of closing. Those attributes become more important as you get later into the cycle. I think that given what's happening within NOI growth, we don't really see the market changing from a pricing perspective so much. And for all the reasons Brad said cap rates we think are going to continue to hold very, very strong, because even with the prospect of some slight rise in interest rates, the NOI growth rate is more than compensating for that. So it's going to cause I think values to hold up quite strong. But the early indication that you see that as you get later in this cycle, the early trends that sometimes happen is certainty of close becomes a more important characteristic. And when we get to that point, that's where we think that we may have a little bit more success.
John Kim: Thanks for the color. Thank you. I also wanted to follow up on your same-store revenue guidance, which was 9% at the midpoint. Tim mentioned the earnings that you're getting from rents signed last year. But the last couple of quarters, you had it at 15% and 16%. And this quarter is trending at 15% as well. So what gets you to the 9% revenue? Is there any other offsetting factors that would offset the very high rent growth that's already been achieved?
Al Campbell: I'll start with that and then turn it to Tim. I think a couple of things. One, you're looking at revenue. So what we're talking about is effective rate growth is going to be 10%, which is a little higher and that's going to be based on largely what we talked about starting off that 16% level, which is great to see and expecting as we move late into the year to see those two normalizing factors occur a little bit, so it’s normal seasonal pressure in those comps. And so that's the . Also in terms of  you've got some other areas, other income items that though they're growing, they're not going to grow at 10%. So that kind of gets you to the 9% there. And so that's how we're thinking about that factor. So I'll let Tim add more color.
Tim Argo: I think the fees and the  a little bit lower occupancy is what gets you from the effect of rent growth to the revenue growth. And then back on the pricing, it's again sort of back to Al's point about seasonality. Typically, we would see Q2 as kind of the highest price point for blended pricing, Q3 down a little bit and Q4 down from there with seasonality. And that's really what's driving it is sort of we expect that return to normal seasonality, but starting off certainly at a higher point than we would in a “normal year.”
Al Campbell: Yes. Don’t forget, we also mentioned earlier, we're also giving ourselves 30 basis points, we're sort of eating 30 basis points of occupancy that's in that total revenue to give ourselves the room to continue pushing price as well. So I think all those factors impacted.
John Kim: Great. Thank you. Looking forward to seeing you somewhere .
Eric Bolton: Yes, absolutely.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC. Your line is open.
Rich Anderson: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So you’ve said a few times the kind of main variable to guidance among the main variables is what happens with new lease growth. A rule of thumb in my mind about strength in the market in multifamily is when new lease growth exceeds renewal, and that's been happening. That's obviously likely to shift this year. Do you have an idea of how low new lease growth could go, and that is in your blended number of 10%? And the reason why I ask is, I feel like you've done 6%, 7%, almost 20% new lease growth in the fourth quarter? Could it be possible that you could get close to zero new lease growth by the end of this year, back half of this year?
Eric Bolton: No. The short answer to that, Rich, is no. We think that when you look at sort of the supply/demand dynamics and just overall strength of the market, and you're right, new lease pricing is kind of the tip of the spear, if you will. We don't see any scenario suggesting that we see that kind of 0% growth. I think that particularly in the Sunbelt markets where we continue to see demand drivers, job growth, household formation, trends population, trends migration, trends such that the demand side of the equation we think in 2022 is likely to be as strong if not stronger than what we saw in 2021. And then following on what Tim mentioned as well, supply levels and deliveries in 2022 are actually down slightly from 2021. So while clearly there was some COVID recovery kind of and unique circumstances taking place in 2021 that helped there a little bit, when you just look at the key fundamentals that drive absorption and our ability to push rents in 2022, we see no reason at the moment to believe that there's going to be any material deterioration in fundamentals. As Al mentioned, the only thing that we're really thinking about is that we know that we've got some tough prior year comps and it's hard to put a number on that. But it's there. And then we'll have to wrestle with that topic a bit later in the year. And then we do think that contrary to 2021, there probably will be some seasonality that will come back into 2022. And as you get particularly into the fourth quarter, the holiday season, leasing volumes to our traffic, it just tends to moderate a little bit. So we didn't see that in 2021. We may not see it in 2022. But we're assuming we will. And as to where that actually gets to from a new lease pricing perspective, we will see. As Al mentioned, we really budget and forecast and manage our business based on blended performance. But we certainly see new lease pricing remaining positive in 2020.
Rich Anderson: Yes, I recognize zero is an extreme ring, but nonetheless it got the answer I was looking for. So the second question, you've had a great year last year. You're looking to have another great year this year. But perhaps a mirror image of last year where it's great in the first half and slows down in the second half. Considering that cadence, we should be starting to condition people that this type of growth, double digit blender growth is not a forever circumstance. Is that the right way to think of it? I'm not looking for '23 guidance obviously. But this is setting up for CPI plus return to growth type of thing in 2023 and beyond. Would you agree with that assessment?
Eric Bolton: Rich, it's hard to say. I think if you look at '23 and beyond, probably the biggest challenge we have is we're dealing with prior year comparisons at a level that we've never dealt with before. But again, fundamentally, when you think about the drivers of demand for housing broadly, there's been all kinds of studies. I'm sure you've seen a lot of the research done suggesting that broadly in the U.S., we have undersupplied housing in the U.S. by a significant amount for the last 5 to 10 years. And so you take a region, like these Sunbelt markets where the migration trends, the population grant trends and the job growth trends are such that they're outpacing other regions of the country. The demand is strong. Single family home pricing is escalating at levels beyond anything that we've seen. Developers are having trouble, whether it be single family, multifamily, securing the materials and the labor they need to address the demand that's there. It starts to define a pretty robust environment for the foreseeable future, call it the next three or four years, and particularly, again, as it relates to these Sunbelt markets. So it's hard to say exactly what we get to in '23 and '24. But reverting back to 3.5% to 3% rent growth I don't see that for a while.
Rich Anderson: Okay, great. Well, hope to see you in Tokyo someday soon.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: And our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Good morning, everybody. So you guys talked earlier about the loss to lease being in that high single, low double digit range, and you guys are achieving well above that today on the new renewal lease rates. So is that increase, I guess, above and beyond the loss to lease just reflect kind of what you're expecting for market rent growth this year, or are you guys kind of leading the market and could end up above market by the time we get to year end?
Tim Argo: Austin, it’s Tim. I think the pricing we're seeing right now is a combination, obviously, with the strength but also some of the comps going back to 12 months ago. We really saw pricing start to take off last year, around April, May and then continued to accelerate from there. And so we have this first three or four months where if you want to say there's some easier comps, those are in place, combined with the strength we saw toward the back half of last year. So I think that's kind of what's driving it now. And then, to Rich's point earlier, we'll see sort of a mirror reflection of that as we get into the back half the year and get into some of those tougher comps.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes, that makes sense. So what are you projecting for market rent growth across the portfolio this year?
Al Campbell: Well, I'll tell you what's built in our -- we talked about it earlier also. We really have blended lease pricing built in our  overall. And for the full year, the average it's going to be somewhere probably around 8% that we have built in at this point. And like we talked about, we'll look at that as we move forward. And we've talked about what it's built on this millstone  as we move to back part. Seeing some normal seasonal trends and bumping those comps Tim talked about that. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. And then just last one. I was curious what the rent income ratio is today. And maybe more importantly, what that figure looks like on some of the new moving leases over the last several months? 
Eric Bolton: We track that on a new moving basis. And right now, it's right up -- a little under 24%, which is in line when it is in the third quarter. It's moved up slightly over the last few quarters. It's been running in the 21%, 22% before, but we're seeing frankly great revenue or great salary increases in the folks that are coming in. They're doing well. And 24% is quite comfortable compared to the 30% or 35% you hear from the economists to put stress on households. So a lot of room to run there.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it, great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Alexander Goldfarb: Great. Good morning down there and certainly you guys are popular. A lot of people want to take you to different places. So a few questions here. One, first a clarification. On the year-over-year comps, is there any free rent that you're comping over? So like the 16% number that you cited, is that enhanced in any way by burn off of free rent a year ago, or this is absolute rent growth?
Tim Argo: It's absolute effective rent growth. Concessions were a little bit higher this time last year, but we're talking 10 to 20 basis points of difference. So it's really no impact at all.
Alexander Goldfarb: And then Eric, as far as the seasonality, your markets never really had the shutdown that the Post had. So it's not like there's a big reopening. That said, several articles have highlighted the job recovery back to near pre-pandemic levels. So what do you think is causing the aberration in terms of basically seasonality no longer being the case last year and potentially this year? Is it -- because again, it's not like all these markets suddenly reopened and people are surging back? So what do you think is really driving this?
Eric Bolton: Alex, I think that -- the fact that we did not have a seasonal slowdown in 2021 I think I would just attribute to just a continued very strong demand drivers for housing across the Sunbelt, whether it's job growth, it’s migration trends, as people looking to come to a more affordable region of the country, whatever the motivations and drivers are, I think that those trends were there in 2021 and more than offset whatever slowdown typically occurs when people get to the holiday timeframe, and are just less reluctant to think about moving. I think that we just had such strong pull to these markets for all the reasons I mentioned that in '21, we overcame that normal seasonal mindset. In 2022, I think -- we don't know. We think that it's prudent to think about some kind of a normal seasonal slowdown. Certainly when you look at how we stagger our lease expirations from a portfolio management perspective, we tend to stagger more of our lease expirations in the summer and spring and we intentionally stagger fewer expirations in the winter months, believing that the traffic levels will be a little moderate -- moderate down from what you see in the spring and the summer. So that's the way we've sort of set up the forecast and the way we manage our lease expirations from a portfolio perspective. We may be surprised again in 2022. And with all the factors that are at play today, it may continue to hold up or will hold up to some degree I'm sure. I think that we may be surprised to the upside again in 2022. But right now, we just believe that a normal seasonal slowdown in the holiday fourth quarter of next year is a prudent thing to count on.
Alexander Goldfarb: And then just finally, a quick question on development yields. Obviously, there's this cost pressure, there's timing delays, but you have really strong rent growth. So in your model -- and I realize that every pro forma always pencils, but in your model, do you anticipate rent growth outpacing the timing delays in materials and labor, or do you think that the costs will outrun or that they're even, in which case yields are unchanged?
Brad Hill: Yes, Alex, this is Brad. We are underwriting a little bit of downward pressure on our development yields. The developments that we have in our pipeline right now that we've started, those are kind of locked in, call it a 5.9 yield, with frankly upward movement in that yield when we update with current rents that we're seeing that are outpacing what our original expectations are. So the things that are on the book will certainly outperform what we expect. We do expect those yields to come down maybe to 5.25, 5.5. But I'll remind you that the way we underwrite our developments, we're very conservative. We're underwriting at today's rents with very little trending. So if we have a development that we're working on today that starts in 2023, we do not trend those rents for this year. And depending on what third party provider you're looking at, we're expecting rent growth this year of 10% to 15%. So if we were to underwrite our developments with those trending, I think we'll be fine and match the yields that we're seeing today. But we're not banking on that when we go into a development. We're underwriting with rents today and are just conservative in our underwriting and our expectations.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chandni Luthra from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Chandni Luthra: Hi. Good morning, everyone. This is Chandni Luthra of Goldman Sachs. Thank you for taking my question. So you guys talked about supply levels and deliveries in 2022 were actually down slightly from 2021. So looking out to 2023 and kind of thinking about sort of this fall or rather delay from 2022 plus all this surge capital that we have been seeing into your markets, what gives you comfort that there isn't an oversupply situation developing in your backyard, as we look out beyond this year? And as a follow up of that, how do you think about your offering being competitive in such an event?
Eric Bolton: Well, we don't believe that there is an oversupply risk building at the moment. We think that as you do start to look at 2023, and particularly in 2024, based on permitting data and new start data that we see, it suggests to us that supply levels may pick up or will pick up in late '23 into 2024 from what's currently happening. But that's a pickup in supply. What really matters is how does that supply level compare to the demand that is there in resulting absorption that you get. And with the strong demand trends that we expect to continue across these Sunbelt markets, I would characterize what we anticipate happening as a consequence of supply is perhaps the potential for some moderation in rent growth to begin to show up in late '23 into 2024 as a consequence of supply levels. But the extent of that moderation, if at all, is really going to come down to what's happening on the demand side of the equation. And what we see happening in Sunbelt markets is continued very strong demand. Coupled with that is what's happening on the single family side, both single family rental and for sale, where the demand there continues to -- and the supply there continues to be limited. And so broadly speaking, we just think that it sets up for a very strong demand outlook for apartment housing for the next two or three years. And even with some supply levels picking up a little bit in late '23 or '24, I think it suggests to us that at worst we're looking at a slight moderation, if you will, from today's performance trends on rent growth. But we don't at this point see any reason to underwrite any kind of long-term expectation for even reverting back to long-term historical trends. We think we'll be above that for some time. 
Brad Hill: And this is Brad. I'll add another point to that. On the construction side, we're seeing schedule certainly elongated. We're seeing labor struggles in the market. So getting projects finished is taking longer. So the overall system is pretty much at capacity. So it's really hard to see a major uptick in the supply side as we go forward.
Operator: All right. And our next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Your line is open.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. A quick question on same-store numbers. You guys are forecasting 8% to 10% same-store revenue growth. What is the band by market? Is that like 5% at the low end and 15% at the high end? Where's that band and what markets are you seeing its top and which markets are you expecting to be at the bottom of that among your major ones?
Operator: And I do apologize. Speakers, can you hear us? If you can hear us, we are unable to hear you. And I do apologize, participants, for the technical difficulties. We will try and get the speakers reconnected. Just one moment. And I do apologize, everyone. It looks like the speakers lost power. They are reconnecting just momentarily. All right, everyone. We got the speakers reconnected. They're going to let us know what happened. Go ahead.
Eric Bolton: Sorry. This is Eric Bolton here. We're actually having an ice and snowstorm here in Memphis, believe it or not. And one of the -- the building lost power. And so the generator kicked back on, but the line got disconnected. So all is well, but we did lose power. I'm going to suggest that we just go ahead and wrap up the earnings call at this point.  I think there were three more questions out there. And I would just ask that the two guys reach out to us directly. Feel free to call either myself or Al or Andrew and we'll be happy to answer your questions. But we appreciate everyone joining us this morning and sorry for the lost power here. But all is good on our side. So thank you very much.
Operator: And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MAA Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the Company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, October 28, 2021. I will now turn the call over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance of MAA for opening comments.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Mallory, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Robert DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Brad Hill, our Head of Transactions. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. Our third quarter results were well ahead of expectations. Growing demand across our Sunbelt markets continues to drive strong rent growth and high occupancy, steady job growth, favorable migration trends, wage growth and escalating pricing of single-family housing are all driving strong performance for apartment rents across our portfolio. We're carrying significant pricing momentum into calendar year '22. Resident turnover remains low. Collections remain strong, occupancy is high and rent-to-income ratios remain very affordable. This all suggests to us that we have good capacity in the market for the pricing trends that we are currently capturing. As we think about next year, we believe leasing conditions across our markets will remain favorable. Our Sunbelt markets continue to capture good job growth, driving positive migration trends. New move-ins year-to-date from households relocating to our Sunbelt markets constitute 14% of our new leases as compared to just over 10% in the same time frame of 2020. High pricing trends associated with single-family housing are further supporting strong demand for apartment housing. In the third quarter, move-outs among our resident base to buy a home were down 12% as compared to prior year, and move-outs to rent a home were down 38%. We continue to keep an eye on pressure surrounding supply chain challenges and inflation trends. Year-to-date, our biggest pressure on operating expenses is building repairs and maintenance costs, which are up just over 6%. Pressure is associated with both materials and labor. We expect year-over-year increases in repair and maintenance expenses will likely hold in the 6% range through the end of the year. Our current development pipeline remains on budget for both development costs and timing for unit deliveries. We're working into our planning and pro formas more cost and unit delivery contingencies as we expect the supply chain challenges to be with us through next year. But again, at this point, our current predevelopment pipeline remains fully on track and we expect to start several additional new projects in 2022. In summary, our markets continue to capture strong demand driving robust rent growth that will carry into 2022. And MAA's uniquely diversified approach across the Sunbelt region, supported by a very strong balance sheet, has the Company well positioned to take advantage of the outlook for continued strong leasing fundamentals in our markets. We continue to build strength in our technology platform and their operating capabilities. Our redevelopment program and several repositioning projects will drive higher earnings opportunity from our existing portfolio. We expect to capture meaningful expansion in our operating margins over the next couple of years. In addition, our external growth pipeline continues to expand and will deliver meaningful value accretion over the coming years. MAA is well positioned heading into 2022 and we're excited about the prospects for continued outperformance in the coming year. I'd like to thank the MAA team for the tremendous progress this year and the very positive results. I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?
Tom Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We saw strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the third quarter. Blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 15%. As a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis grew 6.3%. This is nearly 5x the 1.3% growth of the first quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary revenue driver. And with the current blended pricing momentum, we expect it to continue to strengthen through the remainder of the year. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 96.4%. As outlined in the release, we saw steady progress from our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program as well as the installation of our smart home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. For the full year 2021, we expect to complete just over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and installed 22,000 Smart Home packages. This will bring our total number of smart units up to 47,000 units. We're in the final stages of completing the repositioning work on our first eight full repositioned properties and have another eight that are underway this year. Leasing activity for October has been strong. New lease-over-lease pricing month to date for October is running close to 20% ahead of the rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in October is running 13% ahead of the prior lease. As a result, blended pricing for the portfolio is up approximately 16% so far for October. Average daily occupancy for the month is currently 95.9% which is 30 basis points better than October of last year. Exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 6.8%. This is 10 basis points better than prior year. This supports our ability to continue to prioritize rent growth. We are well positioned as we move into the fourth quarter and '22. I'd like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well, have shown tremendous adaptability and resilience over the last year. I'm proud of them and excited about their progress in 2021. Brad?
Brad Hill: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The already robust investor demand for multifamily properties in our footprint has strengthened. Transaction volume is at a record high as investors are looking to buy into the strong rent growth outlook in our Sunbelt markets. Strong leasing fundamentals, coupled with robust investor demand continues to push pricing growth. putting further downward pressure on cap rates. While the main focus of our capital deployment effort is currently on development through our in-house development and our repurchase program with third-party developers, we remain active in the transaction market and are actively evaluating a number of acquisition opportunities. For the moment, new development provides a more attractive investment basis, higher stabilized NOI yield and higher long-term returns to capital. We believe that as we move further into the recovery part of the cycle, we will likely find more compelling opportunities for acquiring stabilized and lease-up properties. Our pre-purchase and development pipeline that includes both under construction and in lease-up projects stands at 2,999 units with a total cost of $710 million. While the size of our development pipeline will fluctuate due to the timing differences of starts and completions, we continue to make good progress towards growing the pipeline. Our in-house development team has multiple sites either owned or under contract that we expect to start construction on in 2022. We have three sites in Denver, one of which is a three-phase site, a two-phase site in Raleigh and a site in Tampa. Additionally, we are negotiating on pre-purchase projects in Charlotte and Salt Lake City that we hope to start next year as well. Despite inflationary pressures on materials and labor, we expect stabilized NOI yields on our new projects to remain in the 5.5 to 5.75 range. The strong leasing demand we're seeing across our portfolio is also evident in our lease-up properties, where we're seeing rents and velocity well above our pro forma. Because of this strong demand, we've moved up the expected stabilization date of our Sand Lake property in Orlando by two quarters with an expected stabilization date of third quarter '22. All of our under-construction projects remain on budget and on schedule with yield expectations at or above our original projections. These projects have fixed cost construction contracts, so they remain on budget, but we are seeing increased material shortages due to strong demand and shipping delays. Our construction management team has done a great job in navigating these challenges and minimizing the impact to our schedules. However, we expect these supply chain disruptions could add 60 days or so to any new starts next year. We've made great progress on our remaining dispositions for the year, which includes two properties in Savannah and one in Charlotte. The buyers are through their due diligence processes with hard earnest money deposits so the closing should wrap up fairly soon. Pricing on these 31-year-old assets is very strong, generating a levered investment IRR of 30%. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. I'll turn it over to Al.
Al Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Brad. The continued very strong pricing trends and high occupancy through the third quarter produced revenue performance well above our prior expectations. Core FFO was $0.10 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, with the outperformance essentially all coming from revenue. Rent and lease pricing for the third quarter was 5% higher than projections, supported by an average physical occupancy about 50 basis points above projections. And as we expected, operating expense growth for the quarter moderated given some favorable prior year comparisons, but it is projected to return to the full year range during the fourth quarter. As you saw in the release, this third quarter performance produced a significant increase to both our core FFO and same-store guidance for the full year. We increased projected core FFO for the year to $6.94 per share, which is $0.19 per share above our prior midpoint and now represents a 7.9% growth over the prior year. The increase is driven by revised same-store revenue growth projection for the full year of 5.1% at the midpoint, which is based on continued strong pricing trends through the fourth quarter with some late seasonal moderation expected and we're assuming blended lease pricing averaging somewhere around 10% for full quarter. We left our operating expense expectation for the year unchanged at 4.25% and 4.75% growth which produces revised same-store NOI growth for the year of 5.5% at the midpoint. We do expect some growing pressure from operating expenses as we move into 2022 with personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs and real estate taxes which combined to make up over 2/3 of operating expenses, all expected to begin showing some inflationary increases during 2022. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We completed several important financing transactions during the third quarter, which further enhanced our strength. We issued a combined $600 million in public bonds during the quarter, a barbell deal pairing 5-year and 30-year notes, which had very good pricing for both, have lended to a 2.1% effective rate, which supports our view that our current ratings are conservative. These transactions also fixed over 99% of our debt and extended our average debt maturities to almost nine years, providing employee protection from a rising interest rate environment. We also executed an 18-month forward equity transaction which provides around $210 million of future funding for our growing development pipeline and based on current projections, this takes care of our equity needs for the next couple of years. That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Mallory, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: We will now open the call up for questions.  We will take our first question from Rich Anderson from SMBC. Your line is open.
Rich Anderson: So obviously, because of that saying, unbelievable performance to this point. What concerns you though? I mean to me, this economy and this setup with wage growth and everything happening in a positive direction on top of the supply chain issues suggest at least a risk of -- if there is a new Fed Chairman name that we could see him or her showing might to combat what's going on and perhaps increase interest rates in the short end. I'm curious if you're worried about that. We got a GDP print for the third quarter of just 2%. Do you see these as the main kind of factors in terms of the risks going forward, because obviously, this type of growth can't happen forever?
Eric Bolton: Well, Rich, yes, I mean I think you're certainly hitting on some of the bigger variables that could change that would change the dynamic that we're operating within. I do think that we believe that if we do find ourselves in a rising rate environment, that first, this business that we're in, the apartment business offers, I think, some degree of hedge against rising pricing and rising cost in general as we have the ability to sort of reprice our service and our product pretty quickly. Al and Andrew have done a terrific job of the balance sheet. We've got the -- all the metrics in a very, very strong position and I think, in a position to withstand pressures that we may see a various sorts in the capital markets. So I think that -- and then I think some of the supply chain issues that we've been referencing will continue to be with us for some time. Eventually, that get fixed, but I think it's going to be a while happening probably a couple of years or so. And that may -- it will create some issues for us. But I think it will also potentially cause some delays in deliveries of some of the competing supply that may be coming into the market. So there's -- it's hard to sort of underwrite things right now. There's -- and obviously, there's just a whole lot of noise coming out of Washington, D.C. these days and discussions surrounding changes in tax policies and what degree that may or may not affect the economy and capital and how capital chooses to allocate and invest. So I think there are a lot of worry beads out there in that regard. And from our perspective, we've long believed that the right thing for us to do is just simply orient our capital towards markets where we believe the demand for what we do is likely to be the most stable and the strongest over a full year over a full cycle. You've over the years have heard that -- me oftentimes make reference to the notion that we're trying to be the best full cycle performer we can be. And I think it starts, frankly, with protecting the downside in protecting against risk. And for that reason, that's why we focus the way we do on the Sunbelt and have for 27 years. And then it's also, frankly, why we choose to allocate capital the way we do across the region with a real bend towards both a healthy combination of larger markets as well as secondary markets and with an affordable price point, we think it all just combines to create a higher degree of appeal for our product and thereby sort of sort of drive more stability and the ability to weather down cycles better. I'm excited about the opportunities that are coming in terms of the emerging recovery cycle, and we've got some exciting things happening with development. We've got ample capacity and strengthen the balance sheet to cover risks surrounding that. We've got some pretty exciting things we're doing with redevelopment, which are going to drive revenue growth opportunities off our existing asset base. And then we've got some exciting things we're doing with technology then I think it could continue to create performance advantages for us in the markets where we do business. So, I feel like we're probably as well positioned as we could be for whatever the future holds. And time will tell.
Rich Anderson: That's great, Eric. And just a quick one maybe for Tom. With everything going up in price, including apartment rents, have you seen any indication that people are starting to at least consider doubling up to save some money? Has there been any more of that happening in your portfolio to this point?
Tom Grimes: No, Rich. It's -- the sort of popularity has stayed sort of the same with 1s and 2s being most popular and the efficiency is still the least, only 4% exposure to those in their mid-teens on rent growth, and they're above 95% occupied. So, we're there. But I mean, we they really -- we see people staying put. Our renewal conversations though at higher rates than they've ever been or easier because everybody sees the noise in the market and the price of single-family homes and those kind of things, so there has not been a retrenchment. And then on -- as far as affordability goes, we continue to stay in the same area where we've been in that 21%, 22% range. So, our sense is salaries are adjusting and folks are continuing as is.
Operator: We'll go to now Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Brad Heffern: Just based on the October stats that you gave, it doesn't really seem like there was any seasonality hitting those numbers yet. So then you talked about that 14% averaging out to more like 10% over the whole fourth quarter. So are you seeing preliminary signs of seasonality. Am I interpreting that correctly?
Al Campbell: I think -- Brad, this is Al. I'll take that in those comments as my comments. I think what we have put into our expectations is continued strong trends. I mean October was a little ahead of the quarter, as you mentioned. And so we're seeing that in October, maybe into November, but we do believe there's going to be some seasonal, call it, holiday moderation even as we get into the last month of the quarter we put that in the forecast. And so that kind of brings us to that 10% average. But I'll say this, but also -- the fourth quarter is the lowest number of leases that we do for any other quarter. And so, even if it's a little higher, a little bit lower, it really won't have that big of an impact on that performance. And so we feel like that was the right range to put in.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then I appreciate the comment just now on rent income that it hasn't really moved around that much. Can you just talk about, I guess, what the underlying driver for that is? It just seems surprising if you have new lease up 20% and some of these blended numbers up 15%, like it doesn't seem like the underlying wages would have kept pace with that.
Tom Grimes: Yes. And Tim has some more detailed data on this. But roughly, from '19 to '20, it's moved probably 150, 200 basis points, but it has not moved material, and it's still incredibly affordable. So, it is a shift or what we're seeing is the people coming in the front door are more qualified. So it may not be the rate. It may not be salaries that are coming up, but the people that we are attracting are easily able to pay for the rent.
Tim Argo: I'll add one comment to that. I mean if we go back to the Q3 of '19, two years ago, income for our residents has gone up about 17%. So while rents have increased quite a bit, our incomes have as well. We're not seeing a huge difference in terms of the type of resident where they work, similar sector, a lot of professional services, a lot of financial, a lot of health care. But we are seeing a little more single, slightly younger actually we moved from, call it, 75% single to about 82% single. But overall, incomes are generally keeping pace with great growth.
Operator: We will take our next question from Nick Joseph from Citi. Your line is open.
Nick Joseph: Maybe just following up on the seasonality. What's the loss to lease for the total portfolio today?
Tim Argo: Nick, this is Tim. I'll answer that. We look at it a couple of different ways. But if you take all of those leases that went into effect in September, so new leases and renewals, and compare that to our September ERU or all in-place leases in September, it's about 11% or so, if you look at it that way. And obviously, that changes daily. If you have the same question in December, probably a little bit different answer. The other thing I'll add, if you -- the way we think about it is how is that earned in or baked in to play into 2022. So if you look at our 10% blended lease or release guidance that we gave for the full year 2021, with most leases being on average, 12 months or so, we would expect about half of that to carry into next year. So earned in or baked in rate growth of about 5% right now heading into '22.
Nick Joseph: That's very helpful. And then you made a comment about the supply chain disruptions and the impact. How does that impact your market supply expectations for 2022?
Eric Bolton: Well, it's kind of hard to give you any real specifics on that, Nick, but I would generally tell you that as this supply chain issue continues to prolong in terms of an impact, I've got to believe that it's going to create some construction delays for some of the projects underway. I mean, we just we were anxious about delivering some heart plan siding at one of our projects in Austin that we currently have under construction, and we were really reaching a deadline in the last two or three weeks where we were going to have to make a decision to either hold out and wait and create a delay or make a change to a different type of siding just because we couldn't get the order in. And at the last minute, it did come in thankfully. And so everything is still on schedule there. But I -- we're hearing more and more discussion about material delays and challenges. And of course, it's been that way for some time over the course of the past year with appliances and other things, but we're hearing it more broad spread and more -- including more items than ever. And I just -- I think that as we get into next year, if it continues at the trends that we're currently seeing, I got to believe that supply coming into the markets next year is going to be a little bit below current expectations.
Operator: Our next question will be from Chandni Luthra from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Chandni Luthra: Thank you. Good morning. This is Chandni Luthra from Goldman Sachs. And congratulations on a really strong quarter. Could you perhaps talk about -- you said that you think that given your balance sheet you could get aggressive on development. Could you perhaps give us some color on where do you think development can go for you in this part of the cycle as we think about, say, as a percentage of enterprise value?
Eric Bolton: Well, this is Eric. And one thing I will say, we do not intend to -- I wouldn't use the word aggressive. We intend to be very not -- I mean, we will see some growth take place with our development pipeline, currently, including our lease-up, we're sitting on about $700 million of total funding. We funded a good portion of that at this point. And as Brad alluded to, we've got several projects that are getting teed up that we would likely pull the trigger on in 2022. I wouldn't be surprised to see the overall aggregate, if you will, amount of development to get to $1 billion, maybe a little bit over $1 billion. But recognize that the actual funding obligation in a given calendar year for that kind of pipeline is going to be approaching $400 million or something of that nature is something that we're very, very comfortable in dealing with. But in terms of enterprise value, if we get to $1 billion on a $28 billion or so sort of enterprise value balance sheet, we think that, that's still very comfortable and something that we're very comfortable executing on.
Chandni Luthra: Got it. That's great color. And then you briefly talked about sort of cap rates seeing further downward pressure earlier in the call. I mean, can you give a little -- can you throw a little bit more light there? What are you seeing? How much compression are we talking about? And what's that doing to your yield expectations?
Brad Hill: Yes, this is Brad. I can give you a little bit of color to that. If we go back to, call it, first quarter of this year, cap rates on new deals in the market that we were underwriting and looking at, cap rates were about 4%. Second quarter, they were at, call it, 3.75%. This quarter, that's down to about 3.25%. And these are really trailing three-month cap rates. So these are trailing cap rates that we're looking at. So you can see in the last quarter, we've seen probably a 50 basis points or so further compression of cap rates versus what we saw in the second quarter. So we continue to see a significant amount of capital looking in our markets, looking for to deploy for reasons I mentioned in my comments. So, we don't see any reason on the horizon right now that that is going to stop. In fact, we are hearing more and more stories from our brokers that we're talking to that cap rates are in the mid- to upper twos in some of the markets, depending on what the growth looks like. So again, as I mentioned last quarter, I think from here, it feels like cap rates probably come down a little bit more. But we have certainly seen, as we get later in the year and as often is the case, we have seen bid sheets lighten up a little bit. Some of that is because we've had a historical amount of volume this year. So folks maybe have met their allocation or maybe there's just a little bit of deal fatigue as we get later in the year. But Nevertheless, the pricing that the winning bidder is willing to pay is -- continues to be aggressive driving those cap rates down.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: So Al, you mentioned that the 10% blended lease pricing in 4Q was baked into the guidance despite kind of where you're tracking at this point through October. I'm curious, did you assume any additional moderation in occupancy? Or does it -- do you expect to kind of hold within that high 95% range through the balance of the year?
Al Campbell: We definitely put our guidance -- you've seen our update Austin. We expect to average for the year about 96%. So down a little bit from where we have been. But as Tom mentioned, October occupancy was down just a little bit. Nothing -- it's still in the high 95s. We expect something in the high 95%, something like that. But I think as we mentioned, the pricing growth that's the average for the whole quarter. Taking into account the last part of the quarter, which may be some seasonality, even call it, like we said, even holiday traffic really slows down during that period. But as we mentioned, it really shouldn't have that big impact from the quarter, not as much as we would in other quarters because there's just very few leases that are signed.
Austin Wurschmidt: Understood. That's helpful. And then just switching over to development. A couple of questions. Eric, you mentioned the $1 billion, you've talked about it previously. I mean do you think that you can scale up to that level, to $1 billion or a little bit north of $1 billion, by next year? And then secondly, you guys have talked about the projects and lease-up being a drag this year, but even less of a drag next year, a drag still nonetheless, but with the rent growth that your markets have achieved relative to what you underwrote, could that now be a tailwind at this point into next year?
Eric Bolton: Well, in reference to your first question, yes, we're very comfortable with our ability to execute with a development operation that gets the pipeline to $1 billion, a little over $1 billion and recognize that we're doing it in two different ways. We've got an in-house platform where we've got in-house development and in-house construction oversight. Now we do not actually act as a general contractor ourselves. We always contract that with third-party general contractors. So we're not actually building it ourselves, but we are overseeing the construction. And then in addition to the in-house execution that we've got what we refer to as a pre-purchase program, we're essentially joint venturing with third-party developers, and they really do the construction. And a lot of the development work and we just oversee what they're doing. So yes, I mean, with the staffing that we have today, we feel very confident in our ability to execute at that kind of volume given the ways that we're doing that. And then -- I'm sorry, the second part of your question was what?
Austin Wurschmidt: It was just on sort of the earnings contribution from the . Earlier in the year, you talked about it being a pretty significant drag this year and more modest drag next year, but still a drag. And I was just curious with the rent growth that your markets have achieved relative to what I presume you underwrote was much more conservative. I'm wondering if that's now a tailwind at this point.
Tim Argo: Austin, this is Tim. I mean, I think the key there is we've got we have three deals, I think, in that property pipeline that are -- that will move sort of -- that will complete here in the fourth quarter. And so still, even though we're certainly getting rents as good, if not better, than we had originally pro forma. There's still going to be for the bulk of next year, pretty low occupancy, you take some time to lease up. I think there'll still be a drag. But I do think we'll get to sort of that breakeven cost of capital yield a little bit quicker. So all in all, not as much of a drag as it would have been, but still be somewhat of a drag this year.
Operator: We will take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Alexander Goldfarb: First -- two questions. First, was -- as you guys plan 2022, and obviously, you're not giving guidance now, but you had 8% blended spreads in the second quarter, 15% now. Obviously, on the sell side, we're all imagining where our numbers could go based on these trends. But internally, as you guys sit there and underwrite next year, how do you reasonably underwrite next year, given that historically, you're probably looking at 3%, 4%, maybe 5% rent growth, whereas now your teams are -- I mean presumably, you guys could be 10% rent growth for next year with these type of numbers and a loss to lease. So how do you comfortably underwrite next year without us saying, hey, you're sandbagging, or you guys saying, hey, we left our targets too low and our field team is going to clean up?
Eric Bolton: Well, we do it really, really thoughtfully and carefully. I'll say that. I mean we're in the middle of, frankly, of doing that right now. For us, it really starts with kind of a bottom-up approach, and we have a very robust budgeting process that we go through at a property-specific level. We look at all the supply dynamics. We think about the baked-in trends that we have. And we -- and then at a top level, we think about job growth, we think about sort of the variables that drive demand, all of which we think are going to continue to be very positive into next year. And then in addition to that, we also have the variables surrounding what we're doing with both new technologies and various things that we think are going to create some upside as well as what we're doing with both redevelopment and repositioning efforts. So there's a lot of variables that go into it, and we underwrite them each of those in very specific ways in order to build up to what we what we think is the right expectation to establish. So I think that, as Tim alluded to, I mean, we're going to obviously be carrying in some great baked in performance stronger than I've I can remember it ever being. And I think that we'll see where we get to. It's -- I'm not really going to be able to give you a specific answer, Alex, other than just to say we try to go at it in a very detailed fashion. And I think when we wrap up our process, which will be done leading up to a Board meeting we have in December. We'll -- it will be arrived at in a pretty thoughtful manner, I can assure you that.
Alexander Goldfarb: Right. But it would seem like something upper single digits or 10%-ish for rent growth next year is not unreasonable. Would that be correct, Eric?
Eric Bolton: I mean it's -- with the baked in that we're looking at, coupled with some of the redevelopment and some of the market fundamentals, just assuming those continue to stay as strong as they are, I think what you're saying is not unreasonable. But we'll have more to say on that later.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. The second question is on cap rates. You -- obviously, we all know where cap rates have gone. But as far as the total IRR, have IRRs changed so that -- people are paying low 3s, you have 15% rent growth, et cetera. So have IRRs held firm? Or have you seen IRRs also compressing because the cap rate compression more than offsets any rent growth that people are baking in?
Brad Hill: Well, this is Brad. I think it really depends on what your long-term rent growth outlook is certainly putting in one year of 15%, 20% rent growth helps. But what does that look like in years 2 through 10, I think that's really what's going to drive whether your IRRs are coming down or staying flat. I'd say, generally speaking, IRRs are coming down. But to what degree is going to depend on to what degree you believe this outsized rent growth is going to continue, certainly for a couple of years. But outside of that, you've got folks that are dialing in substantial rehab components on assets to help drive those rates up. So I'd say it just depends, but my general comment would be that IRRs are down to some degree.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Amanda Sweitzer from Baird. Your line is open.
Amanda Sweitzer: Following up on that conversation on returns I may have misheard you in the prepared remarks, but it does sound like your tone has changed a bit on pursuing stabilized acquisitions. And if that's the case, what is giving you greater comfort today? Is it mainly being driven by that kind of continued improvement in your cost of capital?
Eric Bolton: Amanda, it's Eric. I think that -- I mean, obviously, the cost of capital factors into it in a big way. But I think that as we just feel like we're getting later into the cycle, supply and starts are -- have picked up a bit this year, and we'll get into more deliveries potentially next year. coupled with probably some growing levels of distress here and there, surrounding supply deliveries and supply chain challenges that we've been hitting on or talking about. I just think that we are getting more optimistic that we're going to see some struggling lease-up situations out there. And we really believe that, that is where we have the best opportunity to execute on an acquisition of a stabilized asset at a price point that we're comfortable executing with. And so, I just think the conditions are evolving to a point that you may see more distress with some of the stabilized assets, particularly lease-up assets, and we're optimistic that, that may yield an opportunity or two this next year.
Brad Hill: Amanda, I'll add one thing to that. As we -- we're getting to a point, we are seeing select instances where there is some aspect of a transaction that appeals to a seller other than the highest price, whether it be a timing, a year-end close or something of that nature. And as Eric said, as we get into situations where some supply chains causes some delays, we are seeing folks using more pref equity, mezzanine equity, things of that nature. So their capital stack gets a little bit more expensive as those delays occur, which could open up some opportunities for us to take advantage of an opportunity here or there.
Amanda Sweitzer: Okay. That makes sense. And then you also mentioned you're excited about your kind of next wave of tech initiatives. Can you talk about what those initiatives are after the Smart Home implementation is complete?
Eric Bolton: Amanda, I'll give you a kind of a quick update on what's going on. This year, we expanded our call center solution. We deployed lead nurturing software which is really just an automated prospect engagement tech that interacts with our prospects earlier and sort of extends the sales process. We upgraded our virtual touring, we launched mobile maintenance and mobile inspections. Sort of the next tools coming are improved self-touring, improved multi-location sales support to simplify online leasing this year, we were able to reduce 30 positions. Next year, we'd expect a headcount reduction, and we're doing this on natural turns. There's not a headcount reduction cost with this of about another . But in short, technology is just allowing us to shape and refine and change the resident journey so that every step of it is easier for the resident, which helps us capture them and help revenues and it's more efficient on the expense side as well.
Operator: We will take our next question from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Your line is open.
Rob Stevenson: You guys give guidance one year at a time, but presumably have some internal numbers run out several years at a time. Looks like given your guidance and what you did last year, you're going to average mid- to high 3% same-store revenue growth over the 2020, '21 period. When you're sitting back two years ago, Halloween 2019 before COVID, is this about where you guys expected to be in terms of portfolio rents and combined same-store growth over the two-year period? Or is there something here that some markets that have been disappointing, where you thought that you'd be higher than this, maybe a little lower than this? How would you sort of characterize that versus your own internal sort of budgeting over the 2021 period?
Eric Bolton: Well, that's an interesting question, Rob. I mean we certainly, in October 2019, did not foresee what happened over the last couple of years. I would tell you that, yes, I think, broadly speaking, when you think about a long-term sort of top line performance for our asset class. We would put it at -- call it, 3.5%, plus or minus, over a long period of time. And I think in a highly competitive business like ours, where pricing is part of the competition tool set. I just think that, that's a pretty reasonable assumption to make. And then our challenge as a management team is then to think about how do we take volatility out of that performance stream I think that, particularly as a REIT paying hopefully a steady growing dividend, it's really important to think about that. And that's why we have the strategy that we do in an effort to try to remove some of the volatility, but yet still be in a position to drive that kind of top line growth. Now we do believe that over time, also with platform capabilities that we should deliver results -- top line results that would be if you will, superior to normal market trends, both as a combination of just balance sheet strength we have, the technology platform that continues to build out and add capabilities, a very robust revenue management system. And then the things that we're doing with repositioning and redevelopment. So to say that over the last two years, at the end of the full two-year cycle, we achieved revenue growth that was kind of in line with where we thought we'd be in October 2019. That's probably not too far off. It's a little more volatile than we would have liked, but we got through it just fine.
Rob Stevenson: And any markets, based on that that have sort of disappointed, if I told you where you'd be operationally back in October 2019? Presumably supply markets, oversupplied markets were weaker, there were some issues like the DCs or the Houston, et cetera, but any markets that sort of stick out to you over the combined two-year period that are still either abnormally strong relative to what you would have thought or weaker than where you would have thought?
Eric Bolton: I mean, the markets that have just been incredibly strong for us and continue to be are -- particularly Phoenix and Tampa, I would point to. Orlando had a dip there that we never would have expected in October of 2019. Orlando is a market that dipped than we would have expected, and that was a lot of impact surrounding COVID and the shutdown of the entertainment and theme park businesses in that market. And Houston has been a bit of a laggard as well, more so than we would have expected. But I think that, broadly speaking, the portfolio did what we hoped it would do. And then some of our or secondary markets, markets like Greenville and Charleston and Savannah, Nashville, Jacksonville have continued to produce the kind of the more steady results that we count on during times of volatility. And Atlanta has been -- it was a little weaker earlier last year, but it's come back really strong. So I wouldn't point to anything really surprising other than just those few I mentioned there.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then lastly for me. Al, when you take a look at property taxes today, I mean, any of your markets where you've basically got a bull on your back given the increase in values, the trades in the market, rents are going, et cetera? Is there any markets where you're really seeing material upward pressure even despite the material upward pressure over, call it, the last almost decade?
Al Campbell: I think I would say on that, Rob, is a combination of growing top line and great revenue growth and declining cap rates, as Brad talks about, has put pressure almost everywhere in our portfolio. There are areas that are more aggressive that we do expect more pressure. We talked often about particularly Texas and Florida. Those two are the most aggressive programs, and they're both combined a little over 50% of our tax liability. So we expect that to be the biggest area in 2022 to really a challenge. Now we'll fight everything as we do. And we'll see what happens. There's some factors that help us a bit in 2022, and then we'll have some areas that aren't assessing. I think Tennessee, North Carolina, they're not reassessing this year, parts of our Georgia portfolio because we've appealed and we've completed those, and there's kind of a lot for one year or two when you've completed appeals. So there some areas that are not going to see assessments that's going to be helpful, but Texas and Florida are going to really challenge us. And so we're preparing for that. And with the growing top line and driving cap rates you expect that we've talked about mid- to upper single-digit kind of expectations in some of those markets. And so that's what -- we'll have more to say about that as we end the year and put out guidance and it's certainly as we move into next year, but that's where the pressure should come from.
Operator: We will take our next question from Anthony Powell from Barclays. Your line is open.
Anthony Powell: Just a question on the disposition to Savanna and Charlotte, just maybe cap rates there and I guess, why selling those properties? And what's your disposition to guess outlook for the next couple of years?
Brad Hill: Yes. This is Brad. First, I'll just start with why those properties. But we go through a process every year where we -- there are obviously multiple departments here that we sit down with and kind of go through what we want to look to sell potentially for next year. That involves looking at properties that have cash flow and CapEx needs that are above what we're looking for in our overall portfolio has generally trend to older properties. We've got some where maybe there's some regulatory issues that we're looking at that we evaluate. We've got properties that are in markets where the rent growth is not really what we want it to be. So we go through that process every year really to identify the opportunities for us to sell for the following year. The other side of that is we're looking at what can we handle in terms of dilution and then what our cash flow needs for the year, our funding needs. So all of that kind of goes into our process, and we're in the process of doing that now for next year. So we'll certainly have more to say about that with our release for next year. But in terms of what we're selling this year, the two in Savannah, the one in Charlotte, we raised our guidance in terms of that. Pricing was quite a bit higher than what we expected, frankly. The way we look at our pricing on these assets is we're looking at a yield our trailing 12-month NOI yield and what we're getting on the proceeds there. And from that basis, we're getting about a 4.2% yield on those. And just for cap rate comparison purposes, just so you can compare across markets that's about a, call it, a 3.25 to 3.5 market cap rate. So very good pricing that we're able to achieve. And just as a reminder, those are 31-year-old assets that we're selling in those markets. And so very, very strong pricing that we're seeing.
Operator: We will take our next question from Alex Kalmus from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Alex Kalmus: I wanted to double click on the struggling lease acquisition targets you mentioned earlier. Given just the robust revenue growth you're getting, it's hard to imagine that lease-ups would be struggling. I'm curious what's driving that, in your opinion? Is it the cost side? Is it unknowledgeable outsiders marketing in the market? What's driving the opportunity?
Eric Bolton: Well, just to confirm, I mean, our lease-ups are actually not struggling. Our lease-ups are running well ahead of expectations in terms of our pro forma and both in the leasing velocity and rents that we're getting what I was making reference to was out in the market, if you will, as we get later into the cycle, I think that there are some other development projects that are out there that may start to run into some challenges surrounding supply chain delivery issues late deliveries. And I was suggesting that some of that may come into play with other third-party developers that are out there that may then drive some purchasing opportunities for us as we get into next year. But our lease-ups are actually doing very well and better than we expected. So just -- that's what I was referencing. We're not talking about struggling lease. So it's not ours. I'm talking about some others as we get it later into next year.
Alex Kalmus: Right. Right. Yes. I was referring to the potential opportunity set for acquiring those, not your own but thanks for clarifying. And just looking at the where the demand is coming from? You mentioned the out-of-state relocations are doing well and moving out to single families down. What about the shift between apartment renters within the market? Are you noticing a trend where they may be within the apartment renters that going a little more suburban or any other trends there?
Eric Bolton: No. The trend has continued on urban versus suburban back in 2021 -- or in 2020 it sort of peaked there. The pricing gap there was 260 basis points as suburban, I would say, it's safe to say was favored and urban was affected a little bit more by supply, that's narrowed to 60 basis points, and both are excellent now. So we're seeing -- and we saw that with AB assets. The delta has just closed and the strength is across the board now. So both AB and urban suburban assets are within the norm of our blended rent growth for the quarter for 15-plus percent growth. So that delta has closed.
Operator: We will take our next question from John Pawlowski from Green Street. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Brad, just one clarifying question on the cap rates you referenced for Charlotte and Savannah,  on trailing 12 months, but the -- was it the -- or was it the buyer kind of market cap rate that you're referring to in the low threes once you adjust for tax reinsurance. Is that accurate?
Brad Hill: Yes, that's correct.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And then, Al, you mentioned growing personnel pressure you expect over the coming years. Could you just give us a bit more detail? Are we talking closer to 5% or 15%? Just order of magnitude, what you expect in terms of personnel cost pressures?
Brad Hill: I mean I would refer to the three primary areas that I've talked about, John. And all of them, the three -- probably the largest expense categories we have or close to it. I'd say I would look at personnel, whereas repair maintenance and taxes, all of those combined, there are probably 2/3 of our expenses mentioned those. And on personnel, obviously, and I'll let Tom give the details, it's just challenging today to keep our workforce to keep all the positions we need, and it's very competitive, and you may have more details on exactly what that will be next year. We haven't really -- we're going through the details now to look at property by property, market by market, the challenges we're seeing. So -- We'll have more to say about that when we put our fourth quarter out. But in all of those categories, you're looking at, call it, a mid-single-digit kind of number likely for 2022, somewhere plus or minus something for all three of those.
Eric Bolton: Yes. John, this is Eric. I mean the thing I would tell you is that what we're obviously working to do to combat some of the pressures on labor costs with -- among our own workforce is we are continuing to introduce more technologies that are, frankly, allowing us the opportunity to eliminate positions we eliminated leasing positions this year, we'll probably be looking at eliminating close to 50 next year through attrition. And I think that there are various things that we're doing like that in an effort to sort of react to not only opportunity surrounding new technology that's coming into becoming available. But in an effort to sort of push back some of the pressures surrounding what's happening in the labor markets, broadly speaking, where we probably to date experienced the most pressure from a labor cost perspective is on contract labor we are forced to go out and hire third-party vendors or third-party contractors to come in and do certain activities that's where we've seen more of the pressure from a labor perspective. But we believe that through various programs that we have within our company from an HR perspective, coupled with the efforts that we've got underway with new technologies and the ability to get more efficient with our headcount levels that we'll probably keep the labor cost itself. I'm going to put it in probably a 4% to 5% range would be, I would think, comfortable to be able to deliver on that kind of performance.
Operator: We will take our next question from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
John Kim: Historically, you've been able to push renewals either than new lease rates, just given the cost and inconvenience for residents to move around. When do you think that environment returns?
Eric Bolton: John, right now, we're -- as you mentioned, we're probably $300 behind on renewals of where we would historically be. So that opportunity is still to be captured. And I would -- as long -- right now, new lease rates are moving at such a pace -- it is -- we are behind the mark on renewals. It is honestly pretty difficult to predict when that gap closes, but we're encouraged by the trajectory.
Brad Hill: And behind the mark, meaning that the new lease prices for new move-in customers is $300 more than what we're charging on a renewal lease. And frankly, as long as the demand level stays as high as it is, and we get the tailwinds from the migration trends and what's happening with single-family housing and so on and so forth. We think that, that probably fuels ability to continue to command a higher price, if you will, from a new move-in customer on a new lease. So when that changes and we go back to a scenario where renewal pricing is exceeding on an absolute dollar amount exceeding what we're charging new customers, hard to forecast, but we don't see it happening anytime in the next year or so.
John Kim: And on the rent growth, I don't know if you still look at your portfolio as cost versus legacy MAA, but is there any difference between rent growth in Class A and Class B, just given supply in the market and affordability concerns?
Eric Bolton: There was, John. I mean on AB assets back in the fourth quarter of 2020, the gap was 310 basis points, and it's closed to about 70 basis points now with both very strong at 14.7% and 15.4%. So it is -- it's really more a market differentiation on performance than an asset class or urban suburban at this point. It has been very strong consistently.
John Kim: Class A getting the higher rent growth or Class B?
Eric Bolton: Class A is 14.7%, Class B is 15.4%.
Brad Hill: It's really -- where you see pressure on Class A is not so much a market function. It's more a supply issue. Whenever you see new supply coming into the market, more often than not, it is going to have a price point associated with the new construction in a location, frankly, oftentimes, that it's going to be a more direct competitor to our existing A-class product, A class portfolio. So to some degree, the performance delta is more a function of supply coming to the market and which part of our portfolio -- a price point of our portfolio is more likely to impact.
John Kim: And are the developers of these new projects, are they offering concessions?
Brad Hill: It varies. In some locations, they do and some they don't. It's hard to give you a widespread. I would tell you that the presence of concessions in the market generally does not exist today versus a year ago. And so broadly, concessions are -- you don't really see that much of the market anywhere at this point.
Operator: We will take our next question from Nick Yulico from Scotia Bank. Your line is open.
Nick Yulico: Al, I just wanted to go back to the expense topic for next year. I mean, it sounds like should we think about expense growth starting at 5% as a reasonable number higher than this year overall?
Al Campbell: Yes. And that was really -- that's a good question, Nick. That's really kind of the point I was trying to get across earlier is that those three -- when you take those three largest areas we talked about, that's now we're 2/3 of the expenses and you've got that mid-single digits kind of number, that's certainly reasonable. And we'll have more to say about that as we move -- as we give our guidance, but that is going to be -- those three are going to be big drivers for next year and the pressure that we see on expenses.
Nick Yulico: Okay. And then my second question is just on rental pricing and how we should think about this because in the third quarter, right, you had -- blended pricing was up 16% -- I'm sorry, that was October 16%. I think it was 15% for the third quarter. When we look at some of the industry data, a year ago, rents in your markets were kind of not up -- they weren't really impacted here. They were sort of slightly down year-over-year or maybe flattish -- and so it really feels like what's happening here in this quarter right now is you have this comparison period where the numbers are very high because a year ago, there was no rent growth. And so you're almost getting like two years of rent growth in one quarter or in October right now. And so as we just kind of think about where rents could be trending going forward, realizing there's -- eventually hit some comp issues next year in the second quarter, third quarter because you had very strong quarters this year for markets. But really the way -- is it the right way for us to think about blended pricing right now is something like half of what the number is, so it's maybe really 7% to 8% on an annual basis, not -- because it's not -- it's very hard to see how it continues at 15%. But is there a reasonable thing to think that, really, on an annual basis, it's sort of half of that right now?
Eric Bolton: Well, Nick, this is Eric. It's kind of hard to answer that specifically. The thing -- let me break it down this way and explain to you the renewal pricing performance is driven by a different set of factors. Renewal pricing as we've alluded to earlier in one of the earlier questions, it has a lot more influence rounding the ability for us to be a little bit more aggressive there because people really just want to avoid the hassle of moving obviously, supply-demand dynamics factor into what we can do on renewal pricing to some degree as well. But also, are they happy, have we done a good job of keeping them serviced and responsive to their needs and so on and so forth. So I think that what we find is that renewal pricing which is, call it, roughly half or so of the blended performance is it tends to be a lot more stable and tends to be a lot steadier, if you will, over the course of the year. And I would tell you that back to what Tom was mentioning a moment ago, when you look at the absolute rent amount that is being charged for new moving customers versus the absolute rent amount being charged for renewal customers there is room to continue to push pretty hard on the renewal pricing without eclipsing or going above the new lease pricing. So we think that the outlook and the trajectory for renewal pricing is likely to remain fairly stable and growing and positive more or less consistent with what we're seeing now and don't really see why that would materially weaken. New lease pricing for new customers coming in tends to be a much more volatile number. And not only do you have market dynamics that come into play there, but you've also got seasonal factors that work into the equation a little bit. And so I think that as we think about what's driving rent growth this year and particularly as it relates to new lease pricing, new customers moving in. There is some of the COVID unbundling, if you will, that's going on that, as you point out, will start to taper off, if you will, at some point. But the other variables surrounding job growth, migration trends, the inability for people to go out and buy homes at pricing that has gotten above what they can afford and so forth. Those variables are likely to continue for some time as we see. And certainly, overall migration trends, the demand for apartment housing across our region has continued to be very robust. So I think that new lease pricing is probably inflated a little bit right now as a consequence of sort of coming out of COVID. And so to some degree, if you want to think about moderation taking place as we get sort of past the code at influence altogether, it probably does show up a little bit more so in new lease pricing and to put a number to that right now is kind of hard because we don't know which of those variables is necessarily creating the most impact. I would tell you, probably as job growth and migration trends and what's happening to single-family housing more so than any sort of COVID unbundling effect that's going on.
Operator: We have no further questions. I will return the call over to MAA for closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: No closing remarks. We appreciate everyone joining us and, obviously, follow up with any questions you may have. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MAA Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded, July 29th, 2021. I will now turn the call over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance of MAA, for opening comments. Please go ahead.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Mallory, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Brad Hill, our Head of Transactions. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I would like to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday’s earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Tim, and good morning, everyone. MAA had a strong second quarter with rent growth, same-store NOI and core FFO results ahead of expectations, strong job growth and positive migration trends continue to drive higher demand for housing across our Sunbelt markets and we expect continued strong rent growth. As noted in our earnings release, we are adjusting our performance expectations for the year and meaningfully increasing guidance for core FFO performance. The various factors that were driving employers and households to the Sunbelt markets before the impact of COVID continue. In addition, the COVID related recalibrating by both employers and employees about where they choose to do business and live continues to also fuel higher demand trends across the Sunbelt. And those trends are accelerating. The new residents that we moved in year-to-date from outside of our Sunbelt footprint increased another 265 basis points as compared to the first six months of last year, during the peak of COVID related relocations. New move-ins from renters relocating to the Sunbelt currently constitute almost 13% of our new leases so far this year, and are trending higher during the second quarter in a number of markets such as Phoenix, Tampa, Nashville, and Charleston, the percentage of new residents moving to our properties from outside the Sunbelt was even higher.
Tom Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We saw a strong pricing performance across the portfolio during the second quarter. Blended lease-over-lease pricing during the quarter was up 8.2%. As a result all in place rents on a year-over-year basis grew to 3.1%. This is more than double the 1.3% growth rate of the first quarter. Average effective rent growth is our primary driver and what the current blended pricing momentum we expected to continue to strengthen through the remainder of the year. In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter increased to 96.4%. As outlined in the release, we saw steady progress on our product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat, and security, as well as leak detection. For the full year 2021, we expect to complete just over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and install 22,000 Smart Home packages. We’re also in the final stages of completing the repositioning work on our first eight full reposition properties and have another eight that will begin this year. We’ve seen activity for July has been strong. New lease-over-lease pricing month to date for July is running close to 17% ahead of rent on the prior lease. Renewal lease pricing in July was running 9% ahead of the prior lease. As a result blended pricing for the portfolio is up 12% so far in July.
Brad Hill: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The strong investor demand for multi-family properties in our footprint that began prior to COVID continues to strengthen today. Transaction volume is up significantly since the first quarter as investors look to buy into the strong rent growth outlook in our Sunbelt market. Strong leasing fundamentals coupled with robust investor demand have accelerated pricing growth, putting additional downward pressure on cap rates. Cap rates on deals we underwrote in the second quarter have compressed another 25 basis points from first quarter and the compression has accelerated in the last 30 days pushing cap rates down approximately 100 basis points since first quarter of 2020. We liked the overall balance and unique diversification of our Sunbelt oriented portfolio and have no need to change our market weightings by participating in the aggressive pricing market for existing properties. Therefore we will continue to focus our capital deployment efforts on new development and pre-purchase opportunities, which provide higher yields, higher growth and a much lower basis than the acquisition opportunities we’re seeing in the current market. We continue to make progress on our development pipeline as noted in our release, we closed and started construction on two pre-purchase projects in the second quarter, bringing our pre-purchase and development pipeline both under construction and in-lease up to 3,347 units at a total cost of $775 million. In addition to these two projects, we have a number of other development sites owned or under contract and hope to start construction on several projects later this year and into 2022. Our pre-development opportunities are in Denver, Salt Lake City, Tampa, Raleigh, and Nashville, all existing markets within our portfolio footprint. We continue to see very strong leasing demand in our region of the country and are recently completed properties in Dallas and Phoenix that are currently in lease up, reflect this strong demand.
Al Campbell: Thank you, Brad. The strong second quarter operating performance produced core FFO that was at the top end of our prior guidance range, $0.08 per share above the midpoint, which also supports improved performance expectations over the remainder of the year. As you saw on our release, we are significantly increasing our guidance for both core FFO and same-store performance for the full year. The increases are primarily based on projections of continued high occupancy levels remaining, essentially full between 95.5% and 96% over the remainder of the year and continued strong rental pricing growth over the second half, particularly during the third quarter with some typical seasonal moderation expected in the fourth quarter. That supports revised revenue growth projection for the full year of 4% at the midpoint of guidance, which is 200 basis points above the prior midpoint. Same-store operating expenses have largely been in line with our expectations for the year. As outlined early in the year, we expected expenses to be somewhat elevated during the first half mainly related to the impact of our double play program. The difficult prior your insurance renewal, as well as some continued pressure on real estate taxes, which would represent about 40% of our total operating costs overall.
Operator: We’ll now open the call up for questions.  We’ll take our first question from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Nick Yulico: Thanks, good morning, everyone. In terms of the new guidance on blended lease growth that you have for the year, I guess, it’s implying some strengthening here, which you’ve seen in July and I assume for the rest of the third quarter, it’s assumed. Can you just maybe just give us a feel for how that’s going to look in the back half of the year? And as well, if those numbers are still very high sort of single-digit, double-digit numbers, what does that mean in terms of the benefit that you’re starting to get for the lease role, as we’re thinking about next year’s results?
Al Campbell: Hi, Nick, this is Al. I can start with that and maybe Tim and I can join on some of those details. So, I think, obviously, as you saw in the second quarter we had tremendous trend coming from the first quarter. Our average pricing, our blended pricing was 2.7% for the first quarter, 8.2% in the second quarter. And so as you look at the back half and you take the guidance that we put out 6.5% to 7.5% for the full year, while obviously assuming continued strength in that. And as I mentioned a bit in my calls, primarily in the third quarter because July, we’ve seen and it’s already very strong, we expect that to continue. We do expect some normal seasonal moderation in the fourth quarter, but still have the strong numbers, but that blends down. So you can do the math on that. You’re around, somewhere around 8% for the back half of the year when you did the math of our new guidance. And so, that’s with – obviously with continued strong and stable occupancy that we talked about those are under guidance there.
Tim Argo: Yes. I’ll add to that Nick, to kind of answer your second question about sort of what the baked in is the way we think about that as you take sort of a half of pricing in one year and half of the pricing in the next year. It should sort of average out to the full year effective rent growth. So to Al’s point about our 7% blended lease-over-lease for the year, about half of that we expect to blend into 2022s and certainly setting up some good strength for next year.
Nick Yulico: Okay, great, thanks so much. Second question is just on, if we look at some markets that are – if we look at some of the industry data coming out on markets such as Atlanta, Tampa, Phoenix right, which you also highlighted as being very strong markets. And I think you also said that the migration into some of those markets from without outside the Sunbelt is higher than other parts of the portfolio, but which may be a factor in this question but I guess, what I’m wondering is when we look at the data, it feels like those markets right now if you blend what’s going on with rent growth this year and last year is actually looking better than pre-COVID. And maybe that migration is a benefit or there are other factors, but just wanted to hear your thoughts on some of these really high rent growth markets, which are not – they didn’t have concessions, so this is pure rent growth you’re seeing. It looks stronger than 2019. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you think is driving that excess rent growth now versus pre-COVID.
Tim Argo: Yes, Nick. I mean, it is economy first. We’ve seen those never let up the gas on the growth. And so that’s continued to roll on in those larger markets. And then secondarily, these move-ins from out-of-market has grown over COVID levels and over prior year, even someone like Phoenix 21% of our move-outs were out-of-market, Tampa 18% out-of-market, Nashville 15% out-of-market and Savannah 16%. Those are substantially higher than we saw even last year, which we believe it sort of accelerated the trend. So it is those items and you’re seeing folks follow jobs announcements from places like Oracle and Tesla and Microsoft and places like that.
Eric Bolton: And Nick, this is Eric. A statistic that I’ll share with you that Tim and some others pull together that I think is pretty telling. If you look at the MAA markets collectively, we have about 28% of the households in America live in our markets, 28%. But you look at where new household formation is occurring, our markets constitute 42% of projected new household formations and that 42% is expected to grow to 44% next year. So, there’s a lot of factors that come into why the household formation trends are so much more robust in the Sunbelt, a lot of them, but I think that the trends that were there before COVID are still there and then I think COVID is sort of cause, as I mentioned, companies and employers and households to sort of recalibrate their thinking a little bit about where they choose to live. And I think that has just added more fuel to the demand curve.
Nick Yulico: All right, thanks Eric and everyone else.
Eric Bolton: Thank you, Nick.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Neil Malkin from Capital One Securities. Your line is open.
Neil Malkin: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Eric Bolton: Hi, Neil.
Neil Malkin: Great quarter, I’m just clapping you over here for the just amazing results, just continue to blow my mind. In your first IRT and Steadfast merger that portfolio seems to be a little bit under the radar, but pretty sizable mostly markets that overlap nicely with your portfolio, some B quality stuff in there, so opportunity to do some highly accretive redevelopment. I am just wondering if you look at that deal and if there any others like it out there and your thoughts on M&A using your stock price given it’s very attractive currency at this point in the cycle and given the strength that you probably expect for the Sunbelt market for quite some time.
Eric Bolton: Hi, Neil, it’s Eric. We are somewhat familiar with that portfolio given the – as you mentioned, the large overlap with a number of our markets. But candidly, this is – that is not something that we looked at and it’s not something that we would have looked at simply because I really saw or didn’t see meaningful strategic value in trying to pursue that. The only new markets for us would have been in Indiana, Oklahoma and their small exposure in Chicago. And frankly, those are not markets we’re really interested in pursuing. In addition, the in-place financing on the portfolio was not really good fit with where we’re – our balance sheet strategy and where we’re working at the balance sheet position to. So absent a strategic, a solid strategic rationale or some form of an assessment that a big opportunity really makes us stronger in some way, just getting a little size is not something we’re really interested in trying to do. We’re looking to strengthen the platform. We’re looking to make ourselves better, if we do something strategic, not just get a little bit bigger. And certainly, absent some sort of a strategic compelling reason to do it, waiting into this super competitive acquisition market and paying top dollar in this environment is frankly and just something we weren’t interested in doing.
Neil Malkin: Yes. Thank you. Appreciate your comments there. Other one for me is you looked at especially this quarter EQR AVB the sort of coastal bellwether have both made pretty candid comments about the regulatory challenging less attractive, coastal markets California, New York, et cetera. And have started to use your word wait into your markets, your backyard. And obviously, that’s a positive in terms of confirming your thesis on your market, but what do you think the biggest, I guess, threats or risks and then potential opportunities could be now that some of the big boy well-capitalized REITs are starting to sniff around your territory?
Eric Bolton: Well, it’s a big region and a lot of market – markets across the region, MAA has a fairly in addition to a long, long history focused for the last 27 years on this region and on these markets, we also have I think a very unique approach to how we diversify across the region. And so, we think that the long history we have on the region, the in-depth deep knowledge we have of the markets and the submarkets probably continues to create some level of advantage for us. I think overtime platform capabilities associate with scale and revenue management, cost of capital and market knowledge to support both operations and also to support a disciplined new growth can drive competitive advantages and long-term outperformance. And as I say, with the 27-year history focused on this region, I continue to like our chances.
Neil Malkin: Yes, okay, I appreciate that. Thank you guys and just tremendous quarter.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Neil.
Al Campbell: Thanks, Neil.
Operator: We will take our next question from John Kim, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
John Kim: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about your guidance for blended lease growth for the year. It actually seems conservative at 7% just given what you printed in the second quarter and then 16% July so far. On top of that, Tom, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that new lease pricing will peak seasonally greater than normal. Can you elaborate on that comments? And then also if you really anticipate the lease growth has slowed significantly from what you have so far in July.
Eric Bolton: Let me start with that, John, and maybe Tim and Tom can jump in on some of that too. In terms of what we have our guidance – if you look at what we’re projecting for the back half of the year, I mean, we projected a strong performance. We’re taking the third quarter as we talked about we continue – that – expect that to continue sort of July strengths into that, but we do expect some modest – seasonal moderation in the fourth quarter and that’s normal. I mean, we – typically that happens. And so, I’ll say this, we’re still projecting the fourth quarter, that’s well above probably anything we’ve recently done in recent history for sure. So it’s strong, but we will have – there is just less demand in that period and good thing is that we’ve designed it, so there is less leases being signed as well. So it has less of an impact as well, but we do expect some. So just to give you a flavor, you can do the math what we’re talking about, but you’re talking more like 10% or more expectations in third quarter moderating down to six or so in the forecast, still very strong projection leading to the full year blend that we’re talking about. So it’s very good to see these trends, but we – reflect what we really think is going to happen over the full year in that.
Tom Grimes: One point of clarification, John, the July is 12% on blended, I think you might have said 16% or 17%. The new lease was that, but the blended was 12%. So we’re expecting sort of August to be pretty similar to that and then start to trend down as demand typically starts to wane a bit.
Eric Bolton: John, one quick way to think about it is blended accommodation both new and renewal pricing year-to-date through the first half of the year was 6%. The forecast assumes that blended performance of the back half of the year even with seasonal factors is 8%. So it’s still positive and good. And we think it’s – they’re definitely reasonable to work off that kind of assumption.
John Kim: Okay. Thank you. And then for the guidance we have seen for expenses, it went up for the year. A lot of that is due to higher repairs and maintenance. Are you accelerating any of these costs just given the strength in the market or you do anything different as far as expensing versus capitalizing certain items?
Tom Grimes: No.
Eric Bolton: No changes in expenses and capitalizing. We would expect repair and maintenance costs to come down in the back half of the year just because of the odd comparisons this year. We have some inflationary pressure on some specific items in that, but that’s in Tim and Al’s guidance for the year.
Al Campbell: There are two things in that, of course, it’s a pretty modest increase in the range overall of 50 basis points, John. But there’s really two things in that, one is, property level performance awards for this strong performance that we’re seeing expected for the year. And we’re very glad to see it and proud of our teams for producing that. So the new some of that…
Tom Grimes: That’s the bulk of it.
Al Campbell: That’s probably the bulk of it. And then you have some inflationary pressures on impairment supplies and things that we did, which is typical across, I’d say, everybody right now with full market, but pretty smaller growth.
John Kim: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Brad Heffern, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Brad Heffern: Yes. Hey, everyone, thanks. Since we’re on the topic of guidance, can you just talk through the 3Q guide a little bit. Obviously, in the second quarter you have the $169 for core FFO and then the mid-point of the third quarter range is $168. So is there some sort of offsetting factor to this strong blended rate growth that you are seeing?
Al Campbell: I think if you look historically, over the last several years, in terms of core FFO, third quarter is usually sort of the low point and it’s really just with all of the activity going on in third quarter, we have – the expenses are at their highest point, obviously getting the highest rents as well. But the seasonality of expenses usually drives and I think honestly, like I said, I think if you look at the last several years Q3 is probably our low point in terms of core FFO, nothing structural driving that other than the normal outage.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then going back to the first question on the call, this double-digit strength we’re seeing in a lot of your markets. How long do you think that goes on more broadly? I mean, is demand just so strong that it won’t taper until you see either demand fall-off or supply pick up or is there sort of just a kind of one-timer pricing of the rent levels that these markets can bear?
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean fundamentally, it comes down to just supply-demand sort of balance and we certainly continue to see evidence that the demand level is going to remain strong other than sort of normal seasonal patterns that we’ve alluded to. It’s hard for me to point to any sort of definitive reason as to why the demand side of the equation is likely to show any significant moderation. I think that if you want to think about some level of catch-up occurring, if you will, as a consequence of what went on last year, we went back and took a look at what we expected to occur last year in the second quarter, in our pricing before we knew about COVID. And obviously last year during COVID, we came in short of those original expectations to the tune of about 250 basis points in terms of blended lease-over-lease pricing. So if one wants to think about this year’s performance has somewhat of an extra juice to it, as a consequence to recover from last year, from a lease-over-lease perspective. I would argue that probably no more than 200 basis points, 250 basis points of that is a function of recovery from last year overwhelmingly what’s driving, it is just all the factors that are driving the really strong demand side of the business. In terms of employers and employees finding reasons to come to the region and then new jobs is continuing to form here. And as I pointed out a moment ago with our markets constituting collectively 42% of the household formation – projected household formations in 2021 and that’s growing to 44% based on the information, we get from economy.com. And some of these other services, it suggests to us that the demand side of the equation is likely to remain pretty robust. And we do think that it’s unlikely for all the reasons Brad alluded to surrounding what’s going on with construction costs, land sites and things of that nature. We think that we probably see supply levels remain fairly elevated like, they are now going into next year. But it’s hard for me to envision supply levels picking-up materially from where they are. So as we sit here today I think we’re pretty optimistic that we’re going to see pretty good favorable demand-supply relationship for us going into next year.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Nick Joseph, Citibank.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. You guys talked about the competition for assets and all the new entrants into the market. Are you seeing the similar level of competition for developments in pre-sale? Or is it a little different than stabilized properties?
Brad Hill: Nick, this is Brad. I mean, I would say that it certainly aggressive. There is certainly a lot of equity that’s looking to put money out in development. I would say, it’s a little less. I think the demand for immediate earning assets is a bit higher than the demand for assets that are not going to produce for three years. So it certainly aggressive out there with a lot of capital, but I would say it is less in the development arena and in the JV arena than it is in the acquisition market.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then you talked about the population movement a lot with people entering the market, but when you look at the move out and obviously turn over still low, are you seeing people leave the markets or any changes or reason to move out with the data that you collect?
Brad Hill: No. We’re seeing a little bit higher move outs, slightly higher on home buying and but primarily job transfer, which is kind of what you would expect especially comparing to last year, when there was less of that kind of movement. And then 4% of our move out sort to outer area and that’s down from 5%. So sort of once people move here, they tend to stay in the area and job transfers and home buying generate the change.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Alex Kalmus, Zelman Associates.
Alex Kalmus: Hi, thank you for taking the question. When you look at their move-ins this quarter and the demographics of the move-ins, are they similar to your current portfolio and do they vary from the out-of-state movers versus within the same markets.
Al Campbell: Though, when we look at it, one thing that is interesting, that is occurring Alex is you would think with the large run-up in pricing opportunity for us that that would stress on affordability. But we’re seeing affordability, staying at 19% to 20% range or the rent to income ratio I should say in that 19% to 20% range. So the incomes are – that are coming in are higher and that is – that’s gives us plenty of room to run in that area.
Alex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much. And moving to the Smart Home tech side, you’ve talked in the past about the A/B testing and potentially gain some top line views from including the Smart Home technology. Have you updated that analysis? And are you still seeing the same sort of top line benefits there?
Al Campbell: Yes, we’re getting a very solid $20 to $25 bump in that. And then what we’ll begin to see as well, we really underwrote on the thing that we knew we would get or we felt strongly about was the revenue opportunity. We’re beginning to see the benefits of our mobile maintenance plan, which was we just installed mobile maintenance or upgraded mobile maintenance for the portfolio in the second quarter. Then that will begin to create some efficiency for us on the expense side, on leak detection, as well as just saving time between units responding to calls real time those kind of things.
Alex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much.
Al Campbell: Thank you, Alex.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Amanda Sweitzer from Baird. Line is open.
Amanda Sweitzer: Thanks. Thanks. Good morning. You’ve gotten plenty of questions on guidance, but I did want to ask about your occupancy outlet that’s embedded for the full year. It sounds like you may have seen a slight increase in turnover more recently, given a sequential occupancy decline in July, how are you thinking about balancing rated occupancy for the remainder of the year? And do you think you’ve reached the structurally high level of occupancy for your portfolio in the second quarter?
Eric Bolton: Yes. Amanda, I’ll start with that and then Tom, you can. The way we look at it is we’ve talked about in the past. Around the 96 point level, which we’re talking about to the back half of the year, high-95 to mid-96 range we’re projecting. That’s essentially full given our turnover and the way things are right now in our portfolio. So we’re projecting to be stable at that very strong, but give ourselves in the back half, a little bit of room to continue pushing on price. We certainly didn’t want to expect occupancy to continue growing from where it is, because we like to continue putting these good prices in the portfolio. So that’s what’s underlying our expectations and our forecasting I mean.
Tom Grimes: Yes. And Amanda on balancing pricing occupancy, I think we’ve always believed that when there is an opportunity to build strength in embedded rent growth that we should take that. And that is something that we did before the pandemic, we will really push that and that gave us higher ERU or effective rent growth for all in place ahead of the downturn, which allowed us to weather the storm and again we’re in an opportunity where we can push rate and that is I would say primary. And honestly, I’d be happy from 95.5% to 96.5% and I’ll think – we were a little higher in second quarter even with the rent increase then frankly, we wanted to be. But given where current occupancy is and more importantly where exposure is, I would sort of expect us to stay in that 96.1% and above range for the next couple of months. But, I mean, we are building strength now and the opportunity to really help our future is to grow rate, right now and we’re having that way.
Eric Bolton: Amanda, this is Eric, one final point final point I’ll make on that. I mean, we do monitor very closely the percentage of our turnover that’s occurring because of the rent increase and we track that. And in the second quarter, the move-outs that we had due to the rent increase were about 7% of our move-outs. And you compare and contrast that to 2019, a more normalized year and move-outs due to rent increase range anywhere from 7% to 10%. So we’ve monitored pretty closely. If we saw move-outs jump up a lot because of rent increase and we would start to taper back a little bit. But at this point, no real change occurring.
Amanda Sweitzer: That’s helpful. Certainly, a good problem to have. And then on development, how are you thinking about staging the construction starts for those pre-development projects you’ve discussed? And then as you think about adding additional projects to that pre-development pipeline, are you still finding the best opportunities and some of those longer-term repurposing and permitting opportunities that you’ve talked about?
Brad Hill: Well this is Brad. Amanda, certainly in terms of the staging, the developments that we’re working on now we’ve got a pipeline right now of about $800 million or so that we’re really working through both owned sites and then sites under contract and they were working on pre-development on and then also our pre-purchase platform. So, those take given where we are in the cycle and given how hard it is to get find sites and get sites entitled. The staging of those you can’t perfectly map those out, frankly. And a lot of the developments that we’re doing in-house are for sites that need to be rezoned. So it takes some time to get through that process. But frankly, really what we’re doing on those is, is working through the pre-development process in our approvals. And then really once we get to a point where we can have a GMP and known construction prices locked in, that’s acceptable to us, we look to move forward with those opportunities. I would say, the pre-purchase timeline is a bit more truncated, because again, we’re putting off some of the risk associated with the pre-development work to the developers that we’re partnering with. So those have a little bit shorter time period on them, sometimes, not all the time. So we’re able to work those in kind of power starts a little quicker than stuff that we’re doing in-house. So a long way of saying, we can’t really perfectly map that out. It’s really once we get costs and approvals, and everything behind us on those projects. And then what was the second part of your question, Amanda?
Amanda Sweitzer: Just in terms of future opportunities to add to your pre-development pipeline are you still finding some of the best opportunities in those longer-term repurposing or permitting opportunities that you’ve talked about in the past?
Brad Hill: Yes, I mean we certainly have opportunities there. I think I mentioned a moment ago, we’ve got about $800 million that we think we can repopulate here and that’s a mixture of stuff that is on balance sheet and then also our pre-purchase – the sites that our development team are working on now. Sometimes are 1.5 years to get through the development process. So, it’s taking a little bit of time to do that on some of them. But, those are great opportunities. But I will say it is becoming increasingly difficult to find sites, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to get sites zoned and permitted and really work through that process. So those are taking a bit longer, but we feel really good about the pipeline that we have and then the ability to repopulate that as we go forward.
Eric Bolton: And Amanda, this is Eric. I would add that we do think that we see the competition for opportunities that involve rezoning or that involve a much longer process. The competition for those sites is not quite as fierce as what you find in something that is shovel ready if you will and ready to go. That’s what caused a lot of the – particularly among the smaller developers and among the some of the private capital coming to the market. They have a mandate that doesn’t allow them to take quite that much time often. And so we do find better opportunities more often than not in more, those projects that require a little bit more time.
Amanda Sweitzer: That’s helpful, thanks for the time.
Eric Bolton: Yes. Thanks, Amanda.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt, KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks, and good morning, everybody. Just curious if you mark-to-market and trend out rents on your existing development pipeline, what the difference or upside between the yield that you underwrote, and what that might suggest? And do you think that the projects could stabilize ahead of the timeline that you’ve outlined in the release?
Brad Hill: Austin, this is Brad. I would say broadly again we’re seeing strength as I mentioned in my comments in our lease-ups and we’re seeing that both in velocity and we’re seeing that also in rate. So I would say, if we trended that out, we’re going to see some good positive momentum in the yields that we have there. Certainly for the two that we have in lease up right now, that’s the case. The other ones that are under construction where pre-leasing is kind of just starting, it’s a little too early to say on those, but we’re certainly seeing really, really good momentum as we go forward there. And in terms of the velocity, we did move up the expected stabilization date of our novel midtown deal in Phoenix by two quarters that again that market is doing extremely strong in the lease up is going very, very well and ahead of expectations, so we have moved that data.
Austin Wurschmidt: Not to put you on the spot, I mean, could you quantify what the yield you think, the yield outside? And I think you’ve said 6% it is sort of the average yield across the pipeline. I mean you think is it 50 basis points or something less in any sense putting a range?
Brad Hill: No, I wouldn’t say 50 basis points. But I would say it’s call it 20 basis points at this point. But again, as we get into the novel mid-town deals, 46% occupied and it’s really – it’s too early to put numbers on that, but broadly, I would say, it’s 20 plus basis points.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. And then as far as redevelopment. I think the average increase was around 11%, but clearly the new lease rates you’re achieving across the portfolio are even higher. What do you think the premium is you’re getting on redevelopment today?
Brad Hill: I think the premiums right at 11%, honestly, because the way we really should try to understand what the market will pay for the premium and match that and then let the market rate push us up from there. So our redevelopment unit may be getting $200 more, $100 of that is redevelopment premium and $100 of it is market growth.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it, got it. Then one last quick one for me. What’s the loss to lease today on the portfolio?
Tim Argo: So Austin, if you think about that in a lot of different ways, and talking to Nick earlier, one of the way we really think about that, it can be very seasonal depending on what time of the year you’re looking at. But, I think we’re expecting 7% blended lease over lease for this year. So that obviously half of that or so trades in the in the next year. So certainly the good spot and I would – it’ll depend on kind of where the full year lease-over-lease.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay, that’s fair. Thanks guys.
Eric Bolton: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Your line is open.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Tom, can you talk a little bit about the markets, first half versus second half and which ones you expect to see the strongest incremental growth for the first half of the year, the second half of the year and then which ones, because either they’ve had such a big pop already, are going to wind-up seeing the least sort of incremental growth as you move forward here?
Al Campbell: Yes. I mean that’s a relative question, Rob, because at this point in July, our leasing growth, I’ve got six markets below 10% blended rent growth and the slower of those are DC and Houston, which are I think 5.2% and 5.7% for blended rent growth but that’s encouraging progress for those. So I don’t think that we’ve seen – I don’t see any market where it’s slowing to be honest with you. In terms of the market, again we’ll have seasonal trends as you’re well aware of but places like Phoenix and Tampa continue to accelerate in places like Atlanta and Austin have really picked it up recently and we’re seeing that on into Dallas and across the portfolio. I mean the number of markets and the majority of our markets are – a large majority of our markets are now pushing higher than 10% blended rent growth. So I don’t see any sort of tipping point that’s been reached other than seasonality. And of course, Eric made the point earlier of we’re pushing through stout renewal increases and we’re getting less pushback than we have historically.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then, Al, once the – when did or when does the insurance renew? And did you get hit with any type of major increase on the last renewal just simply because of higher construction costs on replacing units or  et cetera?
Tom Grimes: We did our renewal effective July 1 and it was roughly we called 14%, 15% year-over-year, which is right in-line with what we’re expecting. We didn’t see anything necessarily driven specifically by development costs. Frankly, the winter storm Uri is really what drove it more than anything. I think we would have had a lower without that. But we feel like we’re in a good position now and taking the appropriate amount of risk on balance sheet and expect to see that continue to decline going forward.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then one last one. Given your markets, how many units do you have that you would have vicked if you could, but are legally prevented from doing so? And then how many units overall in the portfolio are currently in the eviction process?
Tim Argo: Rob, I’d say on that it’s very limited, and you can see that with our collections of 99.2% right now for the second quarter. It’s been strong, I don’t expect the change in rules on evictions to change anything much and we’re working closely with relief fund folks to manage that process. So, honestly I don’t see that it makes a big difference going-forward.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Rich Anderson, SMBC. Your line is open.
Rich Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. So the ultimate sign of fundamental strength, not that we need a hint is when new lease growth is greater than renewal lease rents. And so, I’m curious if in the past when that condition has existed with MAA, how long does it last? And is there anything strategically you’re doing for an incoming new resident that is perhaps driving that level of growth relative to renewals.
Tom Grimes: Rich, what I’ll say is, it is also a sign that we have opportunity on renewal. And I’ll tell you the renewal pricing that was achieved in the second quarter was really priced in the first quarter and vice versa. So, I think you’ll see that delta begin to narrow as we re-price going out. July was higher than the second quarter and we’ll see that continue to grow a bit. But – and the new lease rate really frankly gives us a good cover to begin to move that out up. And again as Eric mentioned, we have a low push back on renewal accept rates, because they can get out and see the housing market pricings very transparent and they know they’ve got a good deal right now.
Brad Hill: Rich, in addition to what Tom alludes to, in terms of the gap closing just as a natural consequence of us repricing on renewals faster, I mean there’s a timing difference between how we price new leases versus how we price renewals, which you alluded to. But in addition to that, I mean, what – frankly, what defines how long the opportunity continues is a function of just basic sort of demand-supply characteristics. And as I’ve alluded to, we – as we sit here today, we don’t see anything near term over the next year. So that’s likely to disrupt kind of the strong environment that we find ourselves in. So we think that we’re going to – we’re going to keep pushing hard today on the pricing increases for new move ins. And today, we are pricing renewals for what we will achieve 60, 90 days from now. And when we get 60, 90 days from now, we will be pricing those renewals at a steeper rate. So it’s sort of – as you say, it’s an indication of real strong fundamentals and we don’t see anything near-term that is likely to disrupt that.
Rich Anderson: Okay. And then when you mentioned early on the 13% new leasing is coming from outside the Sunbelt and you gave some examples of some markets that are above that. What was that percentage kind of 2019? What would it be typically? I’m curious, how much it’s grown to that 13% level?
Brad Hill: I’ll give you an example of it. In Atlanta, as an example, 12% of our move-ins came from outside the Sunbelt, and in 2019, that was a little over 8% in a market like Phoenix, which is incredibly strong in terms of move in some outside the Sunbelt. That was over 21% and so far this year and compared to the same period in 2019 that was a little over 18%. So it’s about a 411 basis point jump from 2019 in Phoenix. We’re seeing saw big jump in Tampa from 2019, this is about over 18% today versus 13% in 2019. So 380 basis point improvement. So it varies a bit by market, but it’s pretty go back to 2019 before COVID. It’s up and move-ins from outside the Sunbelt are up and let’s see it looking at our markets here, the only market that I see where it’s actually the move-ins from outside the Sunbelt are actually down is one and that’s Huntsville, Alabama.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Just s real quick last question. A lot of talk about the cadence between suburbs and urban coastal versus Sunbelt, all those types of geographical dynamics. Do you see within your portfolio any particular strengths, where the population is kind of denser? Do you have better performance there versus a more rural looking area? Or is it just the whole place is great?
Brad Hill: I mean, broadly the whole place is good, Rich, but the delta between urban, suburban and inner loop and A, B was wider during COVID, both have narrowed. So A&B assets the difference between the two is only a 130 basis points but it’s 7.4% for our lagging A and 8.7% for our leading B. I mean those are both numbers I’m happy to have. And then the same real story, it’s almost the same for sort of urban inner loop versus the suburban assets, it 7.5% and 8.7%. So there is – both are strong and there’s just a little bit more of a supply headwind in the urban markets, but we don’t see them as less desirable.
Rich Anderson: Got it, thanks very much.
Brad Hill: Thank you, Rich.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from John Pawlowski, Green. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Great. Thanks so much. Brad, would you mind sharing the cap rate on the Jackson, Mississippi exit and the anticipated pricing on the handful of upcoming dispositions.
Brad Hill: Yes. So we look at this a couple of ways. One is as a cap rate on MAA’s trailing 12 numbers that was about a 5.4, but looked at on a – from a buyer’s perspective with kind of adjusted taxes and insurance, it was about a 4.7 cap rate. Going forward on the three that we’re looking to sell those – both of the metrics are very similar because there’s not a big re-evaluation of taxes on those, but we’re looking in the call it 4.5 or 7.5 range. And John, just to keep in mind, that 4.7 cap rate on the exit from Jackson Mississippi, that’s on 36-year old assets. So average age of that portfolio is 36 years old in Jackson, Mississippi.
John Pawlowski: Understood. And, Brad, upcoming dispositions, what markets are there?
Brad Hill: So we have two in Savannah and one that is in Charlotte.
John Pawlowski: Great. Last one for me, Tom. Single-family rental build to rent communities are the deliveries are probably accelerate pretty meaningfully in the early vintages do have smaller floor plans, a little bit more like apartments. So curious any case studies you’re seeing when a build to rent community opens nearby, any impact on leasing, any statistics or any color you could share will be of interest.
Tom Grimes: No it’s pretty limited. And there, while that is a booming space, it is a relatively small space, but a place we’ve probably seen the most that sort of thing happened and it’s in Phoenix and it certainly hadn’t slowed our momentum there. And just as a reminder and it’s 5% of our move out sort of single-family rental, which is really dwarfed by the job transfer number it is, not a driving factor and we love it that they are raising their rents as well. I mean, it’s been steady where they’ve been.
John Pawlowski: Okay, thanks for the time.
Tom Grimes: Thank you, John.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Buck Horne: Hey, thanks, good morning. Just – yes, thank you. Real quickly. Any thoughts or potential impact from eviction, moratorium, roll-off in your portfolio and/or how are you working with residents right now? It’s potentially recover, any rental assistance payments through the government program.
Eric Bolton: Buck, this is Eric. And no, we don’t really see much change coming as a consequence of the expiration of that CDC moratorium. Frankly, it’s not in our portfolio, we haven’t seen a lot of that activity. And I think that as we touched on ever since this started last spring, I mean we have been very active in reaching out to our residents and offering assistance in various ways with over 8,000 of our residents that we’ve assisted. And we continue those efforts and we are also very active and doing all we can to assist our residents with making application that needed for a financial assistance, we’re very aggressive and active and showing them where to go, we are – where we can, we’re actually doing it for them and making application on their behalf. But it’s not a big percentage of the portfolio, but we don’t really see any near-term change occurring just as a consequence of getting into August and the CDC moratorium no longer being in place.
Buck Horne: Great, thanks. And just following up on the single-family rental question there. Just may be a different tack on it. A lot of builders are out there and a lot of capital is out there building out entire communities and running them effectively like horizontal apartments. Any evolution in your thought process about maybe a partnership or strategic partnership with a home builder or someone else to invest in a single-family rental community.
Eric Bolton: Well, it’s something we kick around from time to time, Buck. I mean we have a number of our communities, where we actually do have adjacent town homes and housing structures if you will that are not traditional apartment type and design. And if we were to find an opportunity to do something, where you’ve got a purpose-built single-family community in the contiguous area with common amenities and all that kind of stuff, yes, I mean something that we would invest in. We’re not actively looking to make that happen at the moment. We think, we were able to capture a lot of good growth right now with what we’re doing with all the projects that Brad has alluded to. But we’ve got, if you will, a little bit of that in the portfolio already. And it’s something that – if we find opportunities in that regard to look at, we wouldn’t hesitate to look at it.
Buck Horne: Thanks, guys.
Eric Bolton: Thank you, Buck.
Operator: We have no further questions. I will return the call to MAA for closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: Okay, well, we appreciate everyone joining us this morning and any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out anytime. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MAA First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.  Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, April 29th, 2021. I will now turn the call over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance of MAA, for opening comments. Please go ahead.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Brad Hill, our Head of Transactions. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I would like to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and good morning. We are encouraged with the solid start to the year as core FFO results were well ahead of our expectations. A recovery in rent growth is clearly getting started. Our overall blended rents on a lease-over-lease basis are running slightly ahead of last year, and our forecast is for continued improvement. A combination of the recovery within the Sunbelt economies that is just starting to build, coupled with the continued migration of employers and jobs to this region, are driving higher level of demand across our portfolio. We like the trends that we're seeing as we head into the important summer leasing season. Our teams are off to a strong start this year with our unit interior redevelopment program, the rollout of our Smart Home technology platform as well as several new projects aimed at full repositioning of communities to higher price points. We're excited about the upside in rent growth to capture from all three of these programs. It was about this time last year when we hit the pause button on these projects in order to protect residents and staff during the initial months of COVID, and we expect to make solid progress this year. Our new development platform continues to expand, and we're excited to have closed this month on our first opportunity in the Salt Lake City market.
Tom Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. The recovery continued across the portfolio for the first quarter. Leasing volume for the quarter was up 16%. This drove blended pricing achieved during the quarter up 2.7%. This is even with the very strong start we had in the first quarter of 2020 and up 200 basis points from the fourth quarter. In addition, we were able to maintain strong average daily occupancy of 95.7%, and all-in place rents or effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis improved to 1.3% in the first quarter. Collections during the quarter were strong. We collected 99.1% billed rent in the first quarter. We've worked diligently to identify and support those who need help because of COVID-19. The number of those seeking assistance has dropped over time. In April of last year, we had 5,600 residents on relief plans. The number of participants has decreased to just 325 for the April of this year rental assistance plan. This represents only 20 basis points of April billed rent. We saw steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. We're off to a strong start for the year on our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile controlled lights, thermostat in security as well as leak detection.
Brad Hill: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Investor demand for multifamily product within our region of the country remains strong. However, a lack of properties for sale is causing a supply demand imbalance that continues to drive already aggressive pricing. This robust investor demand supported by continued low interest rates has further compressed cap rates, which are frequently in the mid-3% and low 4% range for high-quality properties in desirable locations within our markets. Transaction cap rates on closed projects that we underwrote were down 25 basis points from last quarter and down 50 basis points from first quarter of 2020.
Al Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Core FFO per share performance of $1.64 for the first quarter was $0.05 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. As expected, operating trends continued to improve through the quarter, producing same store revenue and NOI performance that was slightly ahead of our forecast, providing about $0.01 per share on favorability for the quarter. We continue to expect stable occupancy and strong pricing trends to have a growing impact on effective rents over the remainder of the year. But keep in mind that only about 20% of our leases were effective in the first quarter, and we still have the majority of our leases to be signed during the summer leasing season in the second and third quarter. The remaining favorability came from overhead and interest expense, which were both lower than projections for the quarter. So overhead costs are expected to grow more in line with our original projections as the year progresses as our travel and other activities move toward more normalized levels. Winter storm Uri impacted a portion of our portfolio during the quarter, where unusually cold temperature and electrical outages led to frozen pipes and damage at a number of our Texas communities. Our operating teams worked hard to take care of our residents and get affected units back online quickly. We incurred some casualty losses during the first quarter related to the storm. We established a receivable for the vast majority of the costs, which are expected to be reimbursed through insurance coverage. Net earnings impact to MAA during the quarter was only about $765,000, primarily related to down units. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. During the quarter, we paid off the $118 million of secured mortgages at an expiring rate of 5.1%. We also funded an additional $64 million of cost toward completion of our development pipeline, which, at quarter end, included seven communities with total projected cost of $528 million, of which $193 million remains to be funded. As Brad mentioned, we acquired two land parcels in April as part of repurchase development deals, which should begin construction later this year. And as discussed previously, we expect our development pipeline to grow to around $800 million by year end, which is well within our development autonomous limits.
Tim Argo: Christy, are you there?
Operator:  First question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. On your effective lease rates, they were growing steadily throughout each month in the first quarter, and it sounds like April is coming in at 5%. How does that compare to your original projections when you came up with guidance for the year?
Al Campbell: Yes, John, this is Al. I think Tim and I can both tag team on this one. But I think as we talked about, we had expected to have strong pricing trends in our forecast for the year, and if you take our pricing expectations are built in our forecast, it's somewhere around 2.5% blended for the full year. I think if you take a look at what happened last year, which was about 1.3% pricing, you add what we expect this year, which in terms of revenue, at about half of that production. And you can blend those two together and come up with 2% basis point that we have in our overall revenue. So we're certainly encouraged by the trends that we see in the pricing that Tom talked about. But remember, as we talked about, we've only had about 20% of our leases effective now, and we've got a lot of leases to come in the second and third quarter, so a long way to go yet. And we'll take another look at that in the second quarter.
Tom Grimes: And we did plan for a return to sort of normal seasonality. So we expected it to be accelerating during this time and kind of move, call it, January through July to be accelerating, then start to trend back down a little bit with normal seasonality.
John Kim: So is the April data, is that coming off an easier comp from last year? And you expect that to trend down? Or is it - with seasonality high in the second and third quarter, you expect it to be...
Tom Grimes: Certainly, on new leases, April was kind of the first month last year, where we saw the weakness. So we're getting some good comparability there. But we would expect it to continue to grow from there and kind of return to that seasonality. So I think to Al's point, it's certainly encouraging with the trends we're seeing, and we'll see how it plays out over the next quarter or so.
John Kim: My second question is on the pre-purchase development program. What are the initial stabilized cap rates that you expect to have from that program? And how does that compare to the development yield?
Brad Hill: Yes. John, this is Brad. So our pre-purchase yields are generally in line with our overall development expectations. So there's really no difference in yields between those two platforms. But I will say, the deals that we have, the seven deals on the books right now, those are generally yielding about 6%. We have seen some pressure relative to construction costs. There's a lot of publications about that. But we would expect around 10 to 20 basis points reduction in costs associated with that. But that's somewhat offset by - if you just look broadly at our footprint in our region of the country, rents continue to do very, very well. So we expect some of that increase in cost and the impact there to be offset by what we expect rents to do within our region.
John Kim: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Just following up on the April lease numbers again. Is the differential between the renewals and the new leases about what you would expect it to be in sort of a normal market for this time of the year? Or is there still some COVID impact that's hitting those numbers?
Tom Grimes: Yes. That is Brad, it's Tom. If things are looking pretty normal, and we would expect to have that gap between new lease and renewal rate at this point in time. It's widest in the winter and then it begins to narrow and tighten in the summer.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then sort of philosophically, I mean, it's been a long, long time since MAA has done any equity issuance. I'm curious, with the market sort of implying a lower cost of equity at this point, whether you would ever think it would make sense to raise money and maybe accelerate development or maybe if you found attractive acquisition opportunities. Or will you continue to sort of just recycle capital and use the cash generated by the business?
Eric Bolton: Brad, this is Eric. At the moment, we believe that the pace under which we're able to find opportunity and deploy capital, coupled with the asset sales that we're going to continue to progress on, we don't see a need for equity. I think it's obviously something we continue to monitor. If the acquisition market began to change in some fashion that really yielded a lot more external growth opportunity, we'd have to revisit that point. But for the moment, we believe that between the recycling and the deployment opportunities we have, and the capacity we have on the balance sheet, we like where we are and don't feel a need to tap the equity markets.
Brad Heffern: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And the next question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Similar to the last question, I mean, recognizing that competition for assets is really strong and cap rates are low. But given some of the growth you're seeing and the strength in sort of the economic recovery here, I mean, have you considered changing your underwriting and getting a little bit more aggressive in growth in some of the acquisition deals that you're taking a look at?
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean, this is Eric. I mean, we constantly challenge our thinking a bit on our underwriting and make sure that we're being as realistic as we can be in what we expect rent growth to do. And so I think that at the end of the day, we're looking at adding stabilized yields to our portfolio that will increase the overall earnings potential of the portfolio long term. And I think that right now, what we see happening on the acquisition side, frankly, requires a level of reach and a level of assumption for a very long period of time that we have a hard time sort of getting comfortable with. We can make the numbers work on both the pre-purchase program and on the new development. Certainly, it's dilution associated with the lease-up and the construction process there. But once those assets get fully stabilized, I mean, the yield is there pretty quick. On the acquisition front, I think right now, frankly, you would have to be comfortable with, I believe, a level of dilution that is longer, frankly, than what we're able to do on the development front and pre-purchase front. So we think we're pushing it in terms of assumptions about as hard as we should, and beyond what we're doing right now would require a level of reach that, frankly, we're just not comfortable with.
Austin Wurschmidt: Understood, and appreciate the thoughts. And then just going back to guidance. I mean, we touched on lease rates a bit. And given how strong they've been, it sounds like occupancy is also continuing to ramp into April. So can you just kind of walk through the assumptions there for the back half of the year and how you're thinking occupancy trends through the balance of the year?
Al Campbell: Yes. So occupancy going into the year, we dialed in about a 10 basis point drop in occupancy compared to last year as we focus on pushing pricing. So with somewhere around 95.5%, 95.6% or so. So kind of given where Q1 was and where we stand right now, we feel good about that. So we'd expect that to be pretty steady, and again, focus given this environment, focus a little more on pushing rents where we can and kind of hold occupancy where it is.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. Appreciate it, thank you guys.
Operator: The next question is from Amanda Sweitzer with Baird. Please go ahead.
Amanda Sweitzer: Your revenue growth recently by some of your smaller markets. Are there any differences between rent income metrics in those markets relative to the larger markets? Or anything else that would impact your ability to continue pushing those large rent increases going forward?
Eric Bolton: No. Amanda, the rent to income ratios in our small market is right or small markets is in line with those larger markets. So we feel like the opportunity will continue there. Not worried about that at all.
Amanda Sweitzer: Okay. And then it's relatively small dollars, but you had another double-digit increase in marketing expenses this quarter. Is that being caused by competitive new supply or driven by any specific markets? And do you expect similar rates of increase going forward?
Tom Grimes: Yes. And I think on expenses for the year, we'll see this. There's a little bit of variability in prior year comparisons. But for the full year, marketing will be at or below 3%. And it's a combination of things. It is both our lead generating activities, but some of the pressure this - or some of the expense in this quarter was bringing online some new tools as it relates to online lead nurturing in our call center solutions, which are helping keep our - which will help keep our personnel costs flat for the year.
Amanda Sweitzer:  thanks, appreciate the time.
Operator: Next question is from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Alex Kalmus: Looking at move-ins from out of state, what did that percentage look like in the first quarter? And how is that trending versus history? I believe last quarter was 12.2% and was at the highest rate. So curious how that's trending.
Tom Grimes: Yes. That's continued on. It's right at the same percentage, and that trend is up from - we've been tracking that for a couple of years. Low point was in Q1 of 2019, where it was 9.2%. So it's still about a 290 basis point increase or so, and that trend is continuing.
Eric Bolton: I would add, Alex, this is Eric, that that's at a portfolio level. And so some of our secondary markets, it tends to be a little bit below that average, whereas you start to look at some of the markets like Austin, Phoenix, Raleigh, some of the markets that are more likely to be benefiting from some of the migration out of California and places like that, it tends to be a little bit higher. As an example, in the first quarter, our move-ins from out of state in Phoenix would double that number. Over 24% of our move-ins in Phoenix in the first quarter came from out of state.
Alex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you for the color. Another - just a question on the development. So the yields are around 6%. What is the spread versus a traditional cap rate on acquisitions today? And is that a similar spread as historical? Or has that spread gotten tighter or expanded because of what we're seeing in the acquisition market?
Eric Bolton: Yes. Alex, I would say the spread is 100, 150 basis points on average. And given just the amount of capital that's looking for acquisitions right now and how that's driven down the cap rates and yields on acquisitions. And certainly, development has been impacted a little bit by construction costs. But I would say in my - as I said in my opening comments, cap rates are down 50 basis points year-over-year. So I would say the spread has probably gotten a little bit bigger, given how much the yields on existing acquisitions have compressed.
Alex Kalmus: Great, thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: First question, bigger picture question, Eric, maybe for you. When you think about the Sunbelt markets and how clearly you guys are going to get a bigger portion of the pie of existing and then future employees with all the corp. relocations, etc.? When you look at your multiple growth drivers, lower balance sheet and where cap rates are trading in the market. I mean, is it fair to say that you guys are undervalued even at current levels, and really, there should be a rerating, particularly across Sunbelt markets and a portfolio like yours?
Eric Bolton: Well, Neil, I do think that at least from what we see that the dynamics that are sort of driving job growth, and ultimately, our ability to drive rent growth as compared to the non-Sunbelt markets. I think that, that overall sort of dynamic has clearly begun to shift. And that shift was under way, certainly somewhat prior to COVID. And as much has been reported on, I think COVID accelerated a lot of those trends. And so I think that, that's one factor that would suggest to me that the demand dynamics and the driver of rent growth dynamics for Sunbelt versus non-Sunbelt, I think it's a new day in that regard. The second thing I would tell you is that, I think, cap rates have begun to adjust a bit in terms of how real estate is being priced in gateway versus Sunbelt markets. I think for many, many years that a lot of investor demand really drove cap rates down in a lot of these gateway markets, particularly a lot of international capital that, frankly, was just more familiar with and more knowledgeable of some of these bigger gateway markets. I think, again, the last few years, particularly, the past year, has begun to, I think, open eyes in the investment community a bit about the shifts that are going on in the US regarding job growth and population trends and taxes and all the other sort of factors that continue to favor the Sunbelt. And I think international capital is also paying attention to that. And I think as a consequence of that, I think the historic delta between cap rates for gateway versus non-gateway markets, I think that those cap rates have compressed certainly today. And I think they will remain more compressed or that gap will be more narrow than it has been historically. So I think there is some logic to what you're saying for both of those reasons, and I think the next few years will tell a lot about how these companies are able to perform, the platform is able to perform and how investor appetite continues to evolve. And I do think that there is some logic to what you used to think about five or six years ago in terms of pricing of real estate in Sunbelt markets versus where we should be pricing it today on a relative basis to non-Sunbelt. It's a different day.
Neil Malkin: Yes. I totally agree. It's a great day. Next question is about the operating side. A lot of, I think, recent conversations about technology and how that's shaping kind of the new wave of sort of institutional asset management, property management. Can you just kind of talk about what technology looks like for you guys and how you think about it, say, over the next three years in terms of implementing enhancements to the revenue maximization, I mean? And then on the expense side, just like with how you think leasing is going to be, property level headcount, anything along those lines would be really interesting and I think something that we need to be on a look out for over the next couple of years.
Brad Hill: Neil, I'll kind of give you a high-level overview of, and you're correct. I mean, there's a transformation under way in our business. Currently, what we have rolling is an expanded - call center solution is out and that allowed us to make some staffing headcount reduction changes about how leasing phone calls are handled on-site. We've also deployed a lead nurturing software, which is automated prospect engagement technology, so to interact with the prospects earlier in the sales process and automates the follow ups. We've upgraded the virtual touring. We've implemented mobile inspections, which really makes it a lot clearer to the resident, the condition of their apartment when they move in, and then clearly document the deficiencies if they move out. That's helped us with speed of inspection as well as clarity on billing and resident satisfaction. We're midway through deploying our mobile maintenance solution, which will give us some efficiency on that side of the business. What's coming next, has improved. I mean, we've got self-touring, but automating that process. We've got some tests ongoing with improved multi-location sales support, covering one property from another one. And I would expect the things we have under way right now built into the 2021 budget is a 30 positions or about 3% of our office staff. This will be handled through attrition. And then I would expect through attrition and automation, we see another 30 to 50 headcount reduction in 2022.
Neil Malkin: Okay. So you're saying 30 this year and then 30 to 50 next year?
Brad Hill: Yes. At this point, it's an evolving process.
Neil Malkin: Sure, sure. Yeah, no, I appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Brad, one follow-up on your comments on the yield compression on development, the 20 basis point deal compression, is that on projects that you've already started or about to start? Or is that on kind of new land you're currently sourcing?
Brad Hill: Yes. That's on new, John. So the projects that we have under construction right now, those are intact. No impact on construction costs or anything like that. Those are locked in when we start construction. Those returns in rents and lease up, as I made a point in my comments, are all on schedule. So those are intact. So my reference really was to the impact of costs related to new starts that we would have today and new underwritings that we have today on the development side.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And these construction cost pressures continue improve more structural and less transient, you have the supply chain bottlenecks continuing, do you sense that it will be finally enough to break the fever on starts? If we're talking this time next year or probably not giving the spread to cap rates?
Eric Bolton: John, this is Eric. I certainly hope so, but I don't know. I'm skeptical that certainly that the pressures that we've seen thus far are sufficient to have any meaningful impact to slowing the interest level on development at the moment because of the fact that we are seeing the demand growth and the rent growth opportunity continue to improve and get stronger. And I think that's fueling a level of tolerance and optimism on the underwriting side and the ability to withstand some level of cost increase. Where I think that you could see - and the other thing I would also add, as long as cap rates continue to remain as low as they are, providing the developer the opportunity to exit at today's cap rate environment, I think that - again, that, that supports, at some level, the ability to withstand some increase in cost. One of the things, though, that we're beginning to see increasingly affect development more than anything other than land cost is just the permitting and zoning processes are getting increasingly difficult. And I think that as we continue to see some of these Sunbelt markets facing much population growth and demand growth and some of these infrastructures start to get under a little pressure, I think you may see a little bit more stringent behavior out of some of the local governments and zoning and permitting folks to be a little bit more restrictive than they have been in the past. And I think that probably as much, as anything else, may start to moderate things. I'm comfortable that with all the things that I just went through, that it's likely that supply is not likely to materially increase the levels that we see happening right now. I think the pipelines are full and there's just too much pressure at this point to see any material increase in supply pressure. But I think we're a ways away from seeing a material decline in pressure.
John Pawlowski: Understood. Final question for me. Al, you mentioned the down units in Texas. Could you give us a sense for just kind of the revenue impact these coming months or quarters from these down units, acknowledging it's small on the grand scheme of things?
Al Campbell: I'll just start with that, and I think Tom can answer that. I think what we'd say is, teams - as we talked about in the comments, teams worked very hard to get the vast majority of those units online quickly. And I'd say, as we get through the end of April, we have a very few left, only a handful of units that are down. So overall, as you've seen, what I talked about in my comments, the impact, you've seen the majority of that impact in the first quarter already, John. A little bit will trail, but most of that has been handled. Maybe Tom, you might?
Tom Grimes: Yes, no, John. I mean, we had a total of 251 down as a result of the freeze, 107 of those are already back up. And the remainder will be up shortly. We had a lot more with damage, but the teams were able to service those units without generating turnover in it. So they didn't go to down status.
John Pawlowski: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.
Nick Yulico: Two questions. First, on the concession impact to your portfolio currently, I don't think you break that out unless I missed it. Can you just give us a feel for concessions, how much they're impacting your effective rents right now? And kind of your assumption about how - if you get a benefit from removing those concessions, how that helps rental pricing later this year? How are you thinking about that?
Tom Grimes: Yes, Nick, I'll give you a quick overview. And as you know, we price on a net effective basis. So concessions are really only used when the immediate comps in the submarket are using them. And our concessions are in the lease-over-lease rates that we share with you. But where we're doing at concessions, for the same store group peaked in third quarter of this year at 1.2% of net potential, and it's dropped to just 80 basis points of net potential for the first quarter of this year. So that's just sort of following this general trend of improved pricing power.
Brad Hill: I'll add to that, Nick, that our same store revenue results, the way we reported includes those being spread over the life of the lease.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Great. Just my other question was on in migration to your markets. You have cited this in the past, you gave some data. I don't think you gave an update today. But in terms of move and benefit from sort of outside of your markets, people coming to your portfolio from coastal areas, etc., you also gave some stats in the past about searches for rentals in cities such as Atlanta. So I guess, I'm just wondering if you have an update on that. And also whether that benefit has changed at all because, obviously, we're starting to see some improvement in occupancy in coastal markets. So just trying to understand how that's impacting your portfolio.
Tom Grimes: The trend has continued. It was in 2019, it was 9.2% of our move-ins from around the market. It's moved up to 12% alone in the first quarter. That's about where it was for the fourth quarter. And then we're still seeing them high demand of search rates. And as Eric pointed out earlier, that's at a portfolio level read. And some of our secondary markets get a little less of that in migration. In place - for instance, in a place like Phoenix, it was double that rate of in migration from out of area. So very much - that trend is very much alive and a big part of the bright future of the Sunbelt.
Nick Yulico: Great, thank you everyone.
Operator: And our next question is from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: How are you thinking about the further build out of Salt Lake City and how large could that market become?
Brad Hill: Nick, this is Brad. As we said, when we first started looking at Salt Lake, for operational efficiencies, we'd like to get that market to, call it, six to eight projects in the first stage for us, given just the dynamics of Salt Lake City is to go in there and partner with a developer who has a presence there and an ability to quickly add through development two or three, four projects. And then the next phase we'll be trying to buy through acquisitions, with the final step being our development team perhaps coming in there and building from the ground up. So we're well under way with that with a new project that we have announced there. As I said, we have a development partner that we're partnered with there that has a partner in the market. So they're actively looking and evaluating new sites, and we're hopeful that we can quickly add to our presence there.
Nick Joseph: Are there any other deals currently in the pipeline?
Brad Hill: Not for Salt Lake City, no. There's one land site that is currently under LOI, but there's not one that's imminent at the moment.
Nick Joseph: And then are there any other new market entries expected in the near term?
Eric Bolton: Nick, this is Eric. Nothing specific. I mean, we continue to look at opportunities in some other markets. But at the moment, beyond what Brad just mentioned, we're working some land sites in Tampa. We're controlling a land site in the Research Triangle in the Raleigh-Durham area at the moment. We've got another couple of sites in Denver that we're working. But it's still all within our same footprint at the moment.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question is from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Just to follow-up, I mean, how many projects other than the two that you guys brought on the land deals do you expect to start in 2021 this year from a development standpoint?
Brad Hill: Rob, this is Brad. We have two that we're hopeful we can start this year. But again, those are in due diligence, so obviously, anything can happen at any point in time with those. But that's at this point what we're working toward. As we mentioned, we do have other sites under control and under contract, but those are more likely 2022 starts.
Eric Bolton: We've got a 27-acre site in Denver area called Central Park, east of the old Stapleton Airport area that we are currently doing predevelopment on. And we would hope to be able to start that late this year, the Phase 1. It will be a three-phase project. So it will be a big project for us. So we're hopeful we can get that one started late this year, in addition to the two I've mentioned in Salt Lake and in - the new one in Atlanta.
Rob Stevenson: And what's the rough construction costs expected on the two that you're about to start here?
Eric Bolton: So let's see. I got it right here. Yes. Salt Lake City, the project is I think it's $94 million.
Al Campbell: Both of them are right around $90 million.
Eric Bolton: Yes. $90 million for Salt Lake City, $94 million for West Midtown.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And so you're going to have the Arizona project delivering here. And so that will come out, you'll replace that with two other projects. And so, at least temporarily, until you get the back half of the year and you start to deliver more of the other ones, your pipeline will go up to somewhere in the neighborhood of about $600 million is the way to think about it?
Al Campbell: Well, I think we talked about around - follow that math, how you got there. But what I would say is, as I talked about a bit in the call, we would expect once we start these, the deals they are talked about and a couple that are possible, we kind of put in a couple of potential starts, as Eric talked about, the rest of the year beyond what Brad has talked about. And we could see easily our pipeline getting to what's committed, what's the project, their total cost, what's under way being about $800 million or so about year-end. Yes, a big difference. Slipped a couple of the numbers there, but the $800 million or so. And that's certainly well within the tolerance range that we've talked about in the past. So that's what we're expecting.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then Al, what's the ongoing cost from the high-speed bulk cable package? You guys noted in the release that it's 80 basis points hit same store expense growth. I mean, how far into the future does that continue? When does that start to really sort of burn down or runoff, etc.?
Al Campbell: I'll let Tim give you the details on that. We'll get pretty close to the end.
Tim Argo: Yes. I think for the full year, we're expecting that to be, call it, 70 basis points of expense impact in 2021. And certainly, we're getting revenue impact on it as well. It will have a little bit of outsized impact in next year, but not to the level of 70. And then I think as we get to 2023, it becomes a sort of a normal line item, if you will.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then last one for me. Tom, any markets stronger or weaker than you guys had expected thus far in 2021?
Tom Grimes: Yes. I mean on the stronger side, I would put Orlando in that bucket. They were on my, a little bit of a, laggard list. But as far as the shift in blended pricing from Q4 to Q1, they're up like 430 basis points on a blended pricing basis. And it is good to see Orlando catch its gear again. The theme Disney opened now last two theme parks, maybe it was a month ago, and really the feedback we're getting is that's brought hospitality back. And restaurant is back, and it is moving along again. It's very encouraging to see the improvement in Orlando.
Rob Stevenson: And anything weaker than you expected thus far?
Tom Grimes: No. The push forward has been pretty positive. I mean we're still worried about DC and Houston. They are recovering, but at a slower pace.
Rob Stevenson: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: It appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to our presenters for any closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. And obviously, if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to reach out to us any time. Thank you.
Operator: This will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 4, 2021.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Ashley and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO and Brad Hill, our Head of Transactions. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday’s earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim. We appreciate everyone joining us this morning. As detailed in our fourth quarter earnings report, MAA ended 2020 on a positive note. Results were ahead of expectations and we carry good momentum into calendar year 2021. During the fourth quarter, leasing traffic was strong and we captured 6% higher move-ins as compared to prior year. And despite the normal seasonal slowdown during the holidays, we were able to capture positive blended lease-over-lease rent growth that equals the prior third quarter with particularly strong renewal lease pricing averaging 5.2% in Q4. Average physical occupancy also remains strong at 95.7% in the fourth quarter, a slight improvement from the performance in Q3. We believe these trends supported by improving employment conditions and the positive migration trends across our footprint positions MAA for a continued outperformance into the coming spring and summer leasing season. Overall, conditions are setting up for a solid recovery cycle for apartment leasing fundamental across the Sunbelt over the next three years or so as demand recovers and supply levels moderate a bit into 2022. I believe for several reasons that MAA is in particularly, strong position as we head into the recovery part of the cycle.
Tom Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. The recovery we saw beginning in May and June continued across the portfolio through the fourth quarter. Leasing volume for the quarter was up 6%. This allowed us to improve average daily occupancy from 95.6% in the third quarter to 95.7% in the fourth quarter. In addition to the improvement in occupancy, we’re able to hold blended rents in the fourth quarter in line with the third quarter at an 80 basis point increase. All in place rents are effective rent growth on a year-over-year basis improved 1.3% for the fourth quarter. As noted in the release collections during the quarter, we’re strong. We collected 99.2% of build rent in the fourth quarter. This is the same result we have in the third quarter of 2020. We’ve worked diligently to identify and support those who need help because of COVID-19. The numbers of those seeking assistance has dropped over time. In April, we had 5,600 residents on relief plans. The number of participants has decreased to just 491 for the January rental assistance plan. This represents less than 0.5% of our 100,000 units. We saw a steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. During the fourth quarter, we made progress on our interior unit redevelopment program, as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile controls, lights, thermostat, and security, as well as leak detection. For the full year 2020, we installed 23,950 Smart Home packages and completed just over 4,200 interior unit upgrades. January’s collections are in line with the good results we saw in the fourth quarter as of January 31, we’ve collected 98.7% of rent build, which is comparable to the month end number for the third and fourth quarters of 2020. Leasing volume in January was strong, up 4.9% from last year. Blended lease-over-lease rent growth effective during January exceeded last year’s results for the first time since March. Effective blended lease-over-lease pricing for January was positive 2.2%, a 40 basis improvement from the prior year. Effective new lease pricing for January was negative 1.8%. This is a 70 basis point improvement from January of last year. January renewals effective during the month were up 6.3%. Our customer service scores improved to 110 basis points over the prior year. This aids to our retention trends, which are positive for January, February and March, as well as lease-over-lease renewal rates for those months, which are in the 5.5% to 6.5% range.
Brad Hill: Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. While most buyers have returned to the market, the lack of available for sell properties continues to restrict transaction volume. investor demand for multi-family product within our region of the country is very strong and this supply demand imbalance is driving aggressive pricing. due to the robust demand supported by continued low interest rates, cap rates have compressed further and are frequently in the high 3% and low 4% range for high-quality properties in desirable locations within our markets. we expect to remain active in the transaction market this year, but based on pricing levels, we’re currently seeing, we’re not optimistic that we will succeed in finding existing communities that will clear our underwriting hurdles in 2021. While acquiring will be a challenge as noted in the earnings guidance, we do plan to come to market with $200 million to $250 million of planned property dispositions this year. we will redeploy those proceeds into our growing development pipeline, which currently stands at $595 million with eight projects and just over 2,600 units. In the fourth quarter, we started construction on the MAA Windmill Hill in Austin, Texas, as well as Novel Val Vista, a pre-purchase in Phoenix, Arizona. both of these are lower density suburban projects that we expect to deliver stabilized NOI yields around 6%, well in excess of our current acquisition cap rates. despite increased construction costs as well as some supply chain issues related specifically to cabinets and appliances, our development and pre-purchase projects remain on budget with no significant delay concerns at this point. We have several other development sites owned or under contract that we hope to start construction on in 2021 and into 2022. we are encouraged that despite facing some supply pressure. our phase 2 lease-up property located in Fort worth continues to lease up at our original expectations, as does our soon to be completed Phase 2 in Dallas, we’re over 90% of the units have been delivered.
Al Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Brad and good morning. core FFO of $1.65 per share for the fourth quarter produced full year core FFO of $6.43 per share, which represented a 2.7% growth over the prior year and as well above our internal expectations following the breakout of the pandemic. stable occupancy, strong collections and positive pricing performance were the primary drivers of continued same-store revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which was 1.8%. And for the full year, which is 2.5%. As expected, same-store operating expenses for the fourth quarter were impacted by growth in real estate taxes, insurance costs and the continued rollout of the bulk internet program, which is included in utilities expenses. And now, some of this pressure will carry into 2021, we expect overall same-store operating expenses to begin moderating this year, which I’ll discuss just a bit more in a moment. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We had no significant refinancing activity during the fourth quarter, but we continue to fund development pipeline and internal redevelopment programs. As Brad mentioned, our development pipeline has increased to eight deals with total projected costs of $595 million.
Operator:  We’ll take our first question from Sumit Sharma with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Sumit Sharma: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Thank you for providing all the color on the stats in Q4. I guess to kick things off in terms of the SS rev growth this year, I know you mentioned that Tampa and Phoenix were one of your stronger markets. So, just wondering as you looked at 2020, Phoenix was the strongest performer, Orlando was the weakest. the spread in SS revs was 630 bps. In Q4, that changed, Tampa was better and Orlando was the weakest. So, I guess what’s that spread look like in the context of your 2021 guidance of 1% to 3%. And where do you see the most meaningful change in performance? In terms of things you already know about?
Tom Grimes: Yes, I’ll start with that one. And I’ll let Tim or Al wrapped up on the forecast. What I would tell you is, as I mentioned in the call, the thing that is most different for us in 2021 is the shift in the swing in jobs bringing from negative 6.4 to positive 3.4, and that’s going to be the thing that drives us in that moves – that moves across the markets. We see that at the high end, where we’ll continue to see markets like Tampa and Raleigh, and Phoenix and Jacksonville accelerate. but we’ll also see it in places like Orlando in Houston and D.C., which are weaker now, but they will begin to improve as job growth comes to play in those markets.
Al Campbell: Yes, just looking for the future in our – what we have in our forecast, the 2% overall. I mean, I think you just think about the markets and some of the markets that we’re thinking would be the strongest as Tom talked about and mentioned Phoenix, Raleigh, Tampa, Jacksonville, some of the ones that are going to be okay. markets that are going to be reasonable, it’s still challenging Atlanta, Dallas, Austin, and then some of the more challenging markets, Houston, Orlando and D.C. And I think all of those together and basically, the pricing trends we see right now and expect for the year, given the job growth comes the 2% expectation.
Sumit Sharma: All right, got it. Thank you so much for the color. One more if you will indulge me on supply, now you talked about 2021 supply being 25% – priced 25% higher and centered in urban and downtown market or submarket. I guess we – the permit levels are less than at low levels in pre-COVID levels, but they are increasing as we’ve heard from other market participants as well. So, keeping that in mind, do you have any insights to share on what types of markets or products or price points that are being emphasized by the new permit? So, not the 21 deliveries, but what’s being started right now at a more garden style, more urban, less urban, any color on that?
Brad Hill: Yes. this is Brad. I would say that just giving the economics of what we’re seeing today, it’s really hard to underwrite more urban high density product. So, I think it’s safe to assume that a higher percent of the product that’s being developed today is more suburban in nature. But I’d say having said that, when we look at the spread between the rents of new supply, that’s coming online versus our properties, that spread is still really good and as Eric said that, that’s leading to more redevelopment opportunities for us. So, we think that that continues. It’s hard to say where just looking at permitting trends while they’re clearly down versus pre-COVID levels, I would say construction starts are down even more. It’s hard to say just from the permitting data, where that supply is located. but my sense is that it’s going to be more suburban in nature. but given the economics of where costs are the rent levels of those are still going to be pretty substantial compared to our current product.
Eric Bolton: This is Eric, Sumit, I’ll add to what Brad is saying. I agree, based on everything that I’ve seen that it does – it would appear that the majority of a lot of the – this permitting activity is oriented more suburban in nature. But having said that, one of the things that we’re really starting to see more evidence of is frankly entitlement and permitting is getting more challenging as more of this multihousing product heads to the suburbs. We’re seeing a lot of – particularly, in the satellite cities, the suburban cities, if you will, that have their own school systems and their own municipal governments, they are becoming very restrictive about what they are allowing the way of apartment permitting believing that these additional households will put some level of stress on the infrastructure and we’re seeing that the permitting activity is starting to get a lot more restrictive than it ever has been in a lot of these Southeastern markets. So, I think there’s another if you will, a hurdle starting to develop across some of these Southeast markets that will make it increasingly a little bit more challenging to supply some of these suburban locations.
Sumit Sharma: Thank you so much for the color. I’ll use my time. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Neil Malkin with Capital One. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Hey everyone. Good morning.
Eric Bolton: Good morning.
Neil Malkin: So, this is the first time, I think that you guys have really called or Eric, your comments have called out the in-migration. Can you maybe, talk to that, what you’ve seen over the recent months in terms of that sort of out-migration from the coast just given the confluence of bad factors that the coasts are facing, which has been exacerbated by the COVID and work from home. I think last quarter you laid out some statistics about like, what percentage of your new leases were from out of state. If you could just update us on that and any incremental commentary from the property level managers would be great to hear. Thank you.
Tom Grimes: Yes, Neil. it’s Tom. I’ll jump in on that one, if that’s all right. Move-ins from people moving into our footprint from outside of our footprint was 12.2% of total move-ins in fourth quarter. that’s the highest we’ve seen and reflects the steady upward trend that we’ve seen over the past couple of years. It was – for context, it was 9.2% in Q1 of 2019. So, almost a 300 basis point increase, we’ve seen that steadily happening from 2019 on, just to give you a little bit more color on the Q4 move-ins, New York move-ins, move-ins from New York state were up 36%. And apartment searches – we pull some information from Google, apartment searches in Atlanta were up 60% in New York city, move-ins from Massachusetts were up 43% and apartments in Raleigh searches were up 68% in Boston. And trends go on from there. The other notable is probably California, which is up 60% and apartments in Austin searches were up 90% in Los Angeles.
Eric Bolton: And Neil, this is Eric. just to add on to some of that detail that Tom laid out there. I do think that there are a lot of reasons to believe that a lot of this migration trend that we saw the U.S. population to the Southeast over the past year as I mentioned in my comments earlier, a lot of these trends were evident prior to COVID. COVID accelerated those trends somewhat. And I would tell you that I believe a lot of this – a lot of the moves that took place during 2020 are pretty sticky in nature. And I think that the trends are likely to continue post-COVID. I think you have to recognize a lot of these Southeastern markets. They continue to offer all the same attractive qualities that I think started the trend some years back and what is happening as more employers are bringing more knowledge-based jobs and tech jobs into this region of country. The employment base is really starting to further diversify and of course, work from home and these knowledge-based jobs allows a lot more remote working, which I think is also working in our favor. And so I think that a combination of just how these economic trends have been building, frankly, and these jobs in migration trends have been building for the last 10 years or so recognizing celebrate a little bit last year. but those trends were in place well before COVID, and I think we’ll continue past COVID. the affordability of the region, particularly as it relates to housing continues to – I think be very, very attractive. It will become even more so over the next 10 years. And I think we also have to recognize that these Sunbelt markets are continuing to become very desirable places to live and what Nashville and what Austin, and what Raleigh have to offer people today, versus where they were 20 years ago is night and day difference. And so I’m very optimistic that we are at the beginning of some continued very favorable trends for housing needs throughout this region of the country.
Neil Malkin: Thank you, all. Eric, so I guess what you’re saying is you think it would be – it will take longer, or it may not happen for the people, who’ve moved here, areas to make the trek back to the coastal urban city.
Eric Bolton: Yes. I think the idea that once the vaccine is in place and if you will, society returns to normal. the idea that there’s going to be this giant reversal, our population shifts back to the gateway markets. I think that’s a ridiculous argument. I don’t think that’s going to happen. Those trends were in place to the Southeast and Sunbelt markets before COVID. COVID accelerated a little bit and I think those trends are going to be and we learned a lot last year, and employers learned a lot in and households learned a lot. And I think the attractiveness of this region is only – is better understood today than it ever has been and I think these trends are going to continue.
Neil Malkin: That’s great. The other one for me, the single-family market has been very strong. You have new and existing home sales and mortgage applications at multiyear highs. I’m just wondering, and obviously, you guys are theoretically more exposed to that sort of risk, just given the relative affordability. Have you seen any uptick in move-out for home purchases or home rentals, or anything like that that would give you some reticence, just in terms of potential demand erosion, let’s say over the next 12 months?
Tom Grimes: Hey, Neil, it’s Tom. I mean, nothing – I mean, zero reticence I would say, we’re quite pleased with the way the market conditions are going at this point. In the fourth quarter, home buying this time was up slightly by like three percentage points is a move-out reason or about 200 move-outs on total. So, I mean, we saw a little bit there. but as you look forward, our accept rates are at their normal level. So, we’re not seeing any turnover go up over time there. And home renting is a flat again, so that continues not to be a major factor. We agree with you that the overall, home buying market certainly getting stronger and we wouldn’t surprise to see that tick up from time to time, but it is – it’s really reflective of a strong jobs market and a good economy, and that produces jobs and frankly, jobs are the thing that drive our business. So, it would be my thought thus far.
Neil Malkin: All right. Thank you guys for the time and love the Sunbelt.
Tom Grimes: Thank you, Neil. We do too.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: It’s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. So, I had a question and Nick had another one as well, Eric, as you think about – I know how positive you are on the current markets in the Sunbelt and all the trends that have been accelerated away from the gateway market. You inherited D.C. when you thought a post, I don’t know if it was a gift with purchase or whatever, but you got some exposure to some coastal exposure in the Northeast. What would make you come in and want to buy or developed any gateway markets, I guess, at what point does the risk reward, what needs to happen a) from a diversification standpoint? Is it trends? Is it relative values, growth profiles? I guess, where is your mindset about that today? because if everyone is zigging, maybe, you want to zag and maybe, there would be a good opportunity from a value perspective there.
Eric Bolton: Well, Michael, I would tell you that my principles and sort of the philosophy that I’ve always had in terms of how we think about deploying capital is really continues to be grounded in the overriding belief that the most important thing that we’re charged with doing is deploying capital in a manner to create the highest recurring quality revenue stream and earnings stream that we can to pay a steady growing dividend throughout the cycle. And if you will and creating a optimized, sort of full cycle performance profile. at end of the day, I think re-shareholder capital over time – over a long period of time is largely rewarded through steady earnings growth, obviously and particularly, dividend growth. And having said that, I’ve always believed then that the best way to accomplish that performance objective in that profile is deploy capital, where demand is likely to be the best and the strongest and growing in a consistent fashion over a long period of time. I get it that the Southeast markets for years, the argument and the criticism was that there lower barriers to supply and new supply can come in, and oversupply and market. What I would tell you is, what supply causes is it causes moderation. What demand causes is steady earnings growth over time and on a falloff in demand can have catastrophic consequences and an oversupplied market is unlikely to be catastrophic in nature. It can be weak for a year or two, but it’s unlikely to trigger a massive sort of upsets your earnings stream, which can put a company in trouble, create dividend stress or things of that nature. So, I’ve always believed that these Sunbelt markets offer the performance profile that we’re after and that’s what we should be doing and where we should focus our capital. So, it’s a very long answer to your question, but no – we have no interest in now using this opportunity to go into these gateway markets. I don’t think our – what we’re trying to do for capital for shareholder capital would not be sufficiently rewarded for pursuing that. At this point, we don’t see a reason to do that and we like what we’re doing.
Michael Bilerman: How do you think about just the risk reward from a return perspective, right? I think you’re extraordinarily fortunate to be so heavy in these markets having built the platform that you’ve done through a lot of hard work in acquisitions and M&A and development. But there’s a lot of capital chasing these markets too, right, which is going to drive down returns overall and I’m not ignoring the fact that the demand is extraordinarily strong. but is there a financial side of it too that as money’s coming out of these gateways, that you could create a better total return by deploying capital or reallocating capital in the portfolio, or is that just not – in your view, the demand is not there. so, I’m not going to – it doesn’t matter if I can get 100 basis points or 200 basis points higher initial return out of it.
Eric Bolton: No. I get your point. And I mean, obviously, I think it depends somewhat on your investment horizon as you think about risk return or risk reward return. I think, clearly, there’s going to be opportunities that are going to emerge in some of these gateway markets, where you can go in and deploy capital and make an investment and create an exceptional return on your investment. I think it somewhat depends on your horizon and how long, you want to think about the capital being deployed in that market. Again, from our perspective, we’re very long-term investors, very long-term holders, and we’re trying to create an earnings profile from that investment action to match up well, in terms of how we’re trying to perform for capital over a long period of time. And so we just don’t believe that with that horizon that we’re working with and that objective that we’re shooting for, that the gateway markets really aligned for us in the way we want to try to perform for capital. I’m not suggesting that focusing on those markets is wrong. And I think there are certainly ways to make a lot of money in those markets. But I think, you have to think about your horizon perhaps a little bit differently. And I will say that while we continue to see capital coming into these markets, I think that there are times, where these gateway markets over the last and this over the last 10 or 15 years, I mean, just attracting enormous amount of capital and a lot of international capital sometimes that I think, was really motivated by now semester of looking for a great return on their capital in some cases is looking for a place to preserve capital if you will. And so you get a lot of different influences with some of these bigger gateway markets and particularly, with international capital that can, I think, create some distortions from time to time, in terms of assets are being priced relative to the long-term earnings potential of the investment. So, we just see volatility and other aspects of those markets that – those gateway markets that just don’t really match up well to how we’re trying to perform for capital. And we’re going to continue to focus on it the way we do.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Appreciate that. And this is Nick, just one other question on guidance. The first quarter range is pretty wide. Obviously, we’re a month into the quarter, and there are fewer leases that are signed. I recognize still the uncertainty, but just wondering if you can walk through how you could end up at the high end or the low end, and then specific to your same-store revenue comment, where you expect same-store revenue to be in the first quarter. I know you said it should be the lowest point of the year.
Al Campbell: Yes. Nick, this is Al. I think – and just overall, I mean, just given the uncertainty that’s in the marketplace, I think that the first quarter being the first quarter of the year and where you have the most uncertainty, I think the range was just to reflect that. And I think the driver for the forecast for the whole year is based on revenue performance and so I think that’s the key to be the top or the bottom of the range and really, for the year or for the quarters. And I think the first quarter, as talked about a little bit in the comments is expected to be the lowest revenue quarter for the year, but that’s really reflecting effective rent per unit, which is a combination, which is a backward or a trailing indicator, which is combination of the pricing you did last year, plus what you’re doing this year. And so we’re expecting improving pricing trends, but the first quarter will be the lowest revenue quarter, because it will reflect really, the bulk of last year’s pricing, which was 1.3% on average and we certainly expect that to be higher in 2021 based on the forecast we’re pleading together. So that’s really the key factors. Hope that answers your question.
Nick Joseph: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Tom, there was nearly an 800 basis point delta between the new lease rate and the renewals. How sustainable is that type of spread and given the pricing’s out there on the internet, why aren’t residents pushing you guys harder on renewals?
Tom Grimes: The spread is always going to be kind of the widest at this time of the year, because new lease pricing is at its most challenged, but the – that delta and that delta will close over time. but that gap will always be there. And the – really, the variation is with a new renter, they have a level of leverage, because they’re shopping and they can move anywhere and their switching costs are really the same. if we have done our job and provided good resident service and taking care of the residents and frankly, a pretty challenging time. We’ve earned the opportunity, because we’ve created for value to charge a little bit more. And so that is where we have the most pricing power, because we’ve worked with them, we’ve earned them and their switching costs are a little bit higher. So that delta that you talked about has always been there. It is widest in this time of year and it will be tightest in the summer months, but we expect that and we plan for that and we ask our residents for a little more to reflect the value that we’ve created for them.
Rob Stevenson: And implied in the guidance for the year, I mean, where are you guys thinking that new lease versus renewals winds up coming in? we’re talking about something that’s more or less flat on new leases are still negative there and how significant should the – or is the guidance anticipating renewals be?
Tim Argo: Rob, this is Tim. I think what we would expect overall is that new lease pricing probably slightly negative. It’ll – it’s very seasonal as Tom mentioned and depends on the – it’s sort of the leading edge of demand. So, you’ll see pretty negative in Q1, Q4 move to positive as we get into the summer. But I think over the average, probably a little bit negative and then renewal is kind of hanging in there like they have, anywhere in that five to six range and again, burying some with a little bit higher in the summer, a little bit weaker in the fall and winter.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then the other one from me is, you guys did, call it, $424 million of revenues in 2020. How much of that is non-residential, so retail, commercial, other spaces at your properties? And where did that wind-up coming in versus expectations a year ago? I mean, what was the negative delta? how significantly was that impacted over the last year versus what you would have expected this time a year ago?
Eric Bolton: I think the major component that’s outside of residential is really just commercial. It’s only about 1.5% of our revenue stream. So, it’s really minor overall, Rob. And so we we’ve had pretty good performance. I mean, we’ve looked at our tenants and we certainly have some programs to sort of rent, where we need to – but we had good collection on a lot of our tenants are fair strong, and have strong businesses that have been able to continue paying well. And so it’s – so collections have been good, so it hasn’t even on a small number. We’ve had pretty good performance still on a relative basis.
Rob Stevenson: And the occupancy there, I mean, are you guys fairly full? Is that sort of, is that half full, I mean, how are you guys sort of characterizing, even though it’s a small percentage given that it’s also amenity space for some of your tenants as well I assume?
Rob DelPriore: Hey, Rob, it’s Rob DelPriore. The – we’re sitting in about 85% to 90% occupied and we’ve collected about 90% of the revenues and cash on the commercial side.
Rob Stevenson: Perfect. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Amanda Sweitzer with Baird. Please go ahead.
Amanda Sweitzer: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Can you talk a little bit more about what you’re seeing today in terms of construction financing? Have you seen the large money center banks come back to the market at all? And then how has development loan terms changed relative to pre-COVID both in terms of interest rates and then LTVs?
Brad Hill: Yes, Amanda. this is Brad. I’d say that the construction financing is really kind of a mixed bag. I think it depends on a few things. One the markets that folks are looking in, certainly some markets are easier to get financing in or less hard to get financing in than others. And I think it also depends on the sponsor, I mean, I think what we’re seeing is generally for the larger developers, the strong sponsors that historically, have had a pretty good pipelines. they’re still able to get financing. But I think the smaller developers that do just a handful of deals a year, they’re not as strong. they don’t have as stronger relationship with the banks or having a little bit tougher time getting their debt financing lined up. So that certainly has been an impact in financing. And that also certainly leads to some of our pre-purchase opportunities. in terms of loan terms, we’re seeing, call it, 10-year rates in that 4%, 4.5% range for a construction financing, which I think is still a decent at the moment, really, the only change that we’ve seen – the biggest change we’ve seen in construction or in financing – not construction financing, but is really, has to do with the low cap rates that we’re currently seeing for where these stabilized assets, the low cap rates are starting to drive some LTV movement in order for debt service coverage ratios to continue to be held. So, we are seeing loan to values come down a bit. We’re not seeing any impact yet on pricing, but we’ll really just see how that unfolds later this year as more opportunities come to market, but that’s basically what we’re seeing at the moment.
Amanda Sweitzer: That’s helpful. And then on your comment about that cap rate compression, what’s kind of a reasonable assumption for a cap rate for your targeted disposition this year?
Brad Hill: I think for our dispositions, given that we’re selling – we’re selling our Jackson, Mississippi portfolio, which we had on the market last year is 30-year-old, 35-year-old product in a tertiary market. You’re talking 5 to 5.5 cap rate for what we’ll look to sell this year. We’re looking to sell properties that really don’t wind up as well with our overall growth strategy. It’s going to tend to be older property in some of these smaller markets initially, where really, the – after CapEx; cash flows are really not what we’re looking for. And then the long-term growth is obviously, not what we’re looking for as well. but on a historical basis, the cap rates for these properties are still really, really good at the moment, but I’d say, 5 to 5.5.
Amanda Sweitzer: Okay. That makes sense. That’s it from me. Thanks for the time.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. please go ahead.
Alex Kalmus: All right. Thank you for taking my question. Quick one on stimulus checks, given your market backdrop, the stimulus one-time payments will likely go further for your residents than compared to the urban environments. So well, is there a limited historical fact in, how do you think these will play out in terms of your rent negotiations this year?
Eric Bolton: I wouldn’t think any stimulus check is going to help that situation, but we’re frankly in such a strong position on that with our collection rate where it is, it’ll help close the gap to give us back to last year, and would be welcome, but it would just primarily help a little bit.
Alex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you. And just touching upon the recurring CapEx, I noticed year-over-year, there was a little jump there. Can you provide some additional color and which will be increased?
Al Campbell: I think recurring CapEx can be – it can be the timing of certain jobs, whether it’s some of the significant jobs like paint jobs, and some of the things of that nature. I think over time, we expect for what we put recurring and revenue enhancing together, and we’d expect to spend call it 1,100 per unit to 1,200 per unit those two together in 2021, which is fairly significant to what 2020 was, but somewhere in that field for the long-term.
Tom Grimes: Yes. And I would add, we had a little bit bigger jump from 2019 to 2020 in recurring CapEx, but for 2021, we’re projecting a very modest increase in terms of recurring CapEx.
Alex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. On your prepared remarks, you mentioned blended lease growth rate was 2.2% in January. You expect improving pricing trends this year, but then effective rental growth of 1.7% for the year; assuming that these are apples-to-apples numbers are pretty close to it. Why would that effective rent growth for the year be higher?
Al Campbell: Well, John, this is Al. The effective rent growth talk – we’ve talked a moment ago about that a bit. I think that’s more of a trailing indicator. It’s a combination of all the leases you have in place right now. And so the pricing performance we had for 2020 was 1.3% on average. And so while projecting for 2020 is certainly higher than that. I think you could do the math, but this is a rough approach, but it’s been a pretty easy way to look at it is take half of what we did in 2020 and half of what we expect to do in 2021, and that’ll drive your effective rent growth of 1.7%. So, you can do the math on that back into we’re expecting something in the 2% to 2.5% range on pricing in the first quarter was, I mean, the January was a good indication toward that.
Eric Bolton: Taking away Al just said, if you take half your lease-over-lease performance – blended lease-over-lease performance for 2020 and half of your blended lease-over-lease performance for 2021 collected are together that comprises what your effective will be for the year.
Al Campbell: And that’s the back of the envelope way to do it. But I think if you do that, given that we have at leases an average of a year that works out pretty close and you can get to where we are in our forecast.
John Kim: Okay. Your redevelopment pipeline sits up 15% sequentially this quarter. Can you just remind us how long you think it’ll take to complete the 10,000 units to 15,000 units of redevelopment?
Tom Grimes: In terms of the pipeline going forward, we’ll do over 5,000 units and 2021 towards that. But what we found John over time is that as we move forward our product ages another year and new supplies brought into the market. So, I would be surprised if we ever blew through our potential on that, but at this rate, it would be about three years, but I would expect us to see the pipeline grow over time as new properties are added to it as market conditions change, product added – product is added and product ages.
Eric Bolton: John, just to add to what Tom was saying that, as he mentioned, there’s new product comes into the market, that really what that does is that that expands our opportunity for redevelopment. And historically, at least over the last number of years, where the redevelopment opportunity for us has been – the best has been in some of our more urban-oriented locations, which is really where the opportunity largely lies in portfolio now, particularly with the legacy post portfolio, but as new supply begins to over the next few years, if it is more oriented towards the suburban locations, that’s actually going to expand our field of opportunity for more extensive redevelopment out in the suburb components of the portfolio. Because obviously, this new product is coming in at a price point that is well above our existing product and with comparable locations and comparable appeal in that regard, we can go in and make these investments with kitchen and bath upgrades and create a very competitive product and still off of the market, the renter market, a slight discount to the newer product and get great returns on capital and get great lease-up success with it. So, we think that this is a real opportunity for us over the next few years and we expect it to stay at the same high level for the next three or four years for sure.
John Kim: Is 19.5% a good run rate as far as what you expect – as far as the effective rental growth for the pipeline?
Eric Bolton: I’m sorry. Say that again.
Tom Grimes: Say that again, John. We didn’t get it.
John Kim: The 19.5% rent growth that you had…
Eric Bolton: Yes, yes. Those are, I mean we’re – we test and we would expect our return to continue absolutely.
John Kim: Okay, great. Thank you.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, John.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Zach Silverberg with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Zach Silverberg: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you guys just talk about the opportunity set on your development pipeline after the two new starts, you’re up to about $600 million properties under development, what type of turns are you underwriting and sort of how does that compare to the acquisition market in those specific markets?
Brad Hill: Yes, Zach. this is Brad. I think Eric touched on it a bit in his comments. We do have a number of sites that we’re currently working on – predevelopment work on; we’ve got some that are owned, some that are under contract. I’d say in terms of the terms that we’re underwriting, not a lot different than what we’ve underwritten previously. We are fortunate in our markets that the rents have continued to hold up within our markets. So, we’re not often to make some aggressive assumptions with rent trending or some large recovery and rent in our underwriting. So, the two that we just started as I said in my comments, we’re still looking at north of a 6% yield and certainly, that compares very favorably when you look at Class A brand-new products in our markets, what they’re trading at today. So, we continue to believe in that. we have another own site that we purchased in Denver. We hope to start in 2022. We’re working on a site in Tampa, a site in Raleigh. Those are likely 2022 sites as well. And then we have under our pre-purchase platform, where we’ve got one in Salt Lake City that we hope to start in the second quarter. And then another site in Denver in our pre-purchase platform that we’re – hopefully, we’ll start in the third quarter of this year or so.
Zach Silverberg: Got you. Appreciate the color. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned it was about 3%, I think of gross assets and it was moderate risk, sort of what is the maximum and minimum risk you’re willing to slide the lever on in between development?
Al Campbell: I think we’ve discussed, historically, somewhere around 4% to 5% would be a range that we would look at, I think. but when you’re looking at your actual pipeline relative to your enterprise value, another aspect of risk is how much is unfunded. And so I point to this fact that we have $600 million sort of going right now, we only have a fairly small amount that’s unfunded. So, I think those two factors together, it’s what you would consider. So, we’re definitely at the low end of the risk range on that right now. And you’ll see our pipeline grow a bit at 2021 as Brad talked about and in early 2022, but certainly, a modest risk program given our profile.
Zach Silverberg: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Rick Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.
Rick Anderson: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And of course, Eric, I didn’t expect you to open up the comments suggesting that everyone’s going to move out of the Sunbelt next year. So, no surprise there. but if you do look at the statistics in the period after the last great recession 2010 timeframe, the migration out of New York, for example, substantially slowed. And you can argue that there are some real organs in a lot of other areas that you’re not in that could entice people perhaps even more this time around than then. Again, it’s never been positive in migration. really, I don’t think that’s ever happened with the Sunbelt into a market like New York, but it probably would normalize. And so when you mentioned this 12.2% of total leasing is moving from outside of your footprint, how much is that impacting your growth profile, because you really probably don’t want to hang your hat on that type of level for very long.
Eric Bolton: No, I mean, I think that we still believe that a lot of the growth that we will have in demand, if you will be – people that, that have been in the Sunbelt will stay in the Sunbelt organic, if you will. So, I don’t disagree that the 12%, it go back to years ago before COVID, the move-ins from outside of our footprint, we’re a little over 9%. So, even compared to where we are today with COVID, it’s only moved up from 9% of our movements from outside the footprint to 12% of the – so, your point is valid in that sense. It hasn’t changed radically. But I just, I feel like that what we’re going to find is that over the next – I think there’s a real fundamental shift that has – that was in place if you will to some degree before COVID as employers and job seekers, if you will, were continually drawn to this region of the country as a consequence of all the things that you know about. And I just believe that those factors have not moderated they have not lessened. COVID accelerated them a little bit, but those trends are going to continue well past COVID. And I think that what we’re finding this, particularly as some of this millennial generation continues to age, they’ve moved in up in their career. They’ve moved into jobs increasingly that I think offer the ability to be more remote than they have been in the past that drive that they had to be in New York and work 60 hours, 70 hours a week that was then. they’re in a different place now. And I just – I feel like that a combination of frankly, the aging millennial generation and how they’re lifestyle needs evolve and desires change as well as retiring baby boomers, who are looking for change and looking for a more affordable living that those two big slugs of the demographics of the U.S. the millennials in the retiring baby boomers those are huge numbers. And as those two age demographics evolve, I think the Sunbelt stands to benefit more so than some of the higher cost coastal markets. And so I’ve heard somebody suggest that yes, the coastal markets are going to – the gateway markets are going to come back, but they’re probably going to come back a little bit cheaper and a little bit younger than they were before and I think there’s probably some truth to that.
Rick Anderson: Okay, good enough. That’s good color. And then my second question, perhaps, well maybe, on the uncomfortable side, but I never shy away from that. You’ve had some sort of C-suite succession activity in some of your peers, Essex UDR, AvalonBay and I wonder, to your credit, Eric, you have made MAA not an Eric Bolton show, you have a great bench there. And I think everyone recognizes that, but can you talk about how much this team right now today looks to be in place for the next at least, few, three, four years, or we can talk about the succession plan that’s perhaps in place for you and others, how that dialogue is happening at the board level? Thanks.
Eric Bolton: Okay. Well, we can take a poll around the table right now if you want, but we won’t do that. What I would tell you, Rich; it’s a very active topic at the Board level. We discuss it to some degree at every meeting. There’s active planning that’s underway and continues to this day. I will tell you that I feel great and have no plans to do anything different. I don’t play golf and don’t really have anything else to do. So, I’m focused and planned to continue in that way for some time. But as you point out, we’ve got a great team, a great bench strength; the company has been through a lot in the last seven years to eight years. the team has really come together. And so we’re developing in focus on leadership development and leadership succession, but frankly, we don’t see a lot of change in the near-term horizon.
Rick Anderson: Eric, right. I mean, you’re probably not mentioned £500 anymore either.
Eric Bolton: Now, it’s down to £490.
Rick Anderson: Okay, great.
Tom Grimes: Hey, Rick. just a real quick point on what we’re hanging our hat on as you mentioned earlier. I mean, supply is going to be pretty much the same. Job growth in 2020 was negative 6.1% in our markets, it’s going to be plus 3%, 4% that 900 basis point swing in job growth is really what we’re hanging our hat on for near-term growth.
Rick Anderson: You got it. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it.
Tom Grimes: You bet.
Operator: We will take our next question from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Rick Skidmore: Hey, Eric. Just a question – just with regards to how you think about development going forward, and the shift and perhaps working from home and people wanting more space, are you changing the design of the developments and does that change the economics in terms of how you think about returns as you go forward? Thanks.
Eric Bolton: Rick, I mean, we are a little bit more focused on creating workspace areas, nooks and things of that nature in a number of our apartments. And we’re also very much more oriented towards outdoor amenity areas in a shared office sort of configurations in some of our leasing centers. Frankly, it’s not really having much of an impact on our overall cost of build-out. And we certainly, think that there’s a lot of reason to continue to introduce more of the support for work from home, but no real significant change in terms of the cost impact for us.
Rick Skidmore: Thank you.
Operator: Okay. We will take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hey, good morning, everybody. Could you give us the actual data around what the ratio of jobs to new supply is in 2021 for your markets versus maybe, 2019 and some historical averages, if you have that with you?
Tom Grimes: Yes. Of course, for our group, the jobs to completion ratio last year was negative 8.1; it swings to positive 7.1. And I think we’ve consistently found that 5:1 is a place, where we can grow we’re at. So, it’s a substantial shift and sort of the key to our rent growth aspirations.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes. I appreciate the data point. And I think it kind of really goes to some of the questions that I’ve heard asked and maybe, Eric, your tone, just on the recovery in your markets seems pretty upbeat, but yet when you kind of take where fourth quarter same-store revenue growth was, and you look at the midpoint of the guidance, you layer in the accelerating redevelopment, I guess, one of the questions we have, and I think others are driving at is why isn’t that driving a little more reacceleration other than just the earn-in of last year’s effective rents, is there anything else you’ve assumed in guidance higher turnover, lower occupancy that’s contributing to maybe a more muted reacceleration in 2021?
Eric Bolton: No. I think that what you have to recognize is that getting the revenue impact of pricing changes takes time, and it takes time to go up and it takes time to go down. We went into the 2020 with some of the highest earned in leasing performance that we’ve ever had, and that allowed effective rent per units remain fairly strong if you will throughout 2020, which was hugely helpful. I remember late in 2019, people asking me, what I worried about. And I said, I worried about a slowdown, I worried about something happening with the economy. And in preparation for that worry, the best thing we could do is grow rents as hard as we could, even at the expense of giving up a little bit of occupancy and allow that compounding benefit to be there as a protective performance on revenues should we see the economy weaken and that certainly, helped us this past year. So, what I would tell you that, I mean, there are two things at play here that I think are going to cause the recovery process, recovery slope to be steady as opposed to being a real steep up curve if you will. one is we are still battling supply issues and we will have those supply issues throughout 2021, pretty consistent with what we saw in 2020 that we think it actually peaks in the first part of the year and probably, starts to moderate a little bit towards the back half of the year, but that’s well after we get past the peak leasing season for 2020. So – and then as we pointed out the supply picture, I think improves as we get into 2022 and beyond at least for a couple of years, I think probably, by the time we get to 2024, 2025, it starts to accelerate again, as a consequence of what we see happening with permitting today. But the other factor that is at play here is that, we are still now carrying in the first quarter of this year is going to reflect the full negative impact of the pricing performance that we had to do during the spring and summer leasing season of 2020 when it was at its weakest. And so that all that’s going to continue to roll through the portfolio and it will peak, we believe in the first quarter. but as we get into the spring and summer leasing season of 2021, where we do believe that the leasing environment will be much more positive and better than we will again, start to compound that improvement in terms of our revenue performance and it will build, and it will build by the time we get into late 2021 and particularly, as we get into 2022. So that – those two things sort of supply picture, but particularly, sort of the compounding effect of lease-over-lease pricing and what it does to revenues, it takes time for that to work through the system.
Austin Wurschmidt: That’s very helpful. And then you guys mentioned the – where you expect cap rates on dispositions this year for the assets that you have teed up, where would you pay cap rates today, just kind of across your markets. And I’m curious if you have a sense of maybe, what type of growth buyers are underwriting and how far off you think you are on assets that you’re betting on?
Brad Hill: Well, Austin, this is Brad. I would say, talking about cap rates across our markets, certainly, as I mentioned, it’s very aggressive on new assets for these Class A new assets in our markets that we’re looking at. I would say from a growth aspect, it’s hard to pinpoint what the other folks are certainly underwriting. I would say one of the things that’s driving the difference in valuation, it really is leverage. Certainly, our leverage level is a lot different than high levered buyers that are looking for 65% to call it 80% leverage on some of these deals and given where interest rates are. that’s a big difference in the valuation of these assets. And so I’d say that that’s probably one of the levers that’s having a biggest impact on our ability to be able to compete with those folks.
Austin Wurschmidt: That makes sense. Any sense where maybe, the cap rate spread is versus long-term interest rates versus a couple of years ago, has that tightened at all in your markets?
Brad Hill: I think it’s certainly pretty low. I think if we’re seeing interest rates right now in that 3% to 3.5% range, it’s probably come up a little bit in the last 30, 60 days or so. And you’re still seeing again, cap rates in the low-threes or high-threes, low-fours, that spread is certainly low right now. And what we’ll just have to see as is as interest rates move a little bit more and these LTVs change a little bit how that that filters through in pricing. We just don’t know right now, there’s so little assets coming to market that they’re able to still find a buyer for most of these assets, but as the supply of these properties pick up and come to market, we’ll just have to see if there’s an impact to pricing once that picks up and the supply demand on investments here changes a bit.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thank you. Just one question from me. Last few quarters, the smaller markets that really outperform your larger metros, are you seeing notable, the same notable in-migration trends in the Alabama’s and Memphis Greenville or is this just more of a factor of more supply hitting the larger metros a little harder?
Tom Grimes: I think, I mean, we’re seeing the increase in in-migration sort of everywhere, and you do have it in places like Greenville, but it’s consistent and it’s been the same thing that it has been before things like BMW and BASF and Michelin, and those large international manufacturing conglomerates that are in those places. But it is – so it is – those are holding that is coming –that is continuing. And then obviously, we’re seeing strong results out of the – some of the larger markets than like Phoenix and Raleigh, but the spread of in-migration is fairly widespread even Huntsville is picking up some of it, because of the NASA expansions there.
Eric Bolton: And John, I would add to what Tom saying is that yes, I mean, we do see the supply pressure more pronounced generally, in the bigger markets, and that historically, has always been the case, which is why we’ve always intentionally embraced a good component or a percentage of the portfolio to be invested in some of these secondary markets. We think that secondary marketing exposure does provide some downside protection to our performance profile against the pressures that often come from time to time from supply. And so those secondary markets are doing exactly what we thought they would do during this phase of the cycle.
Tom Grimes: Yes. Sorry, John, I misheard a bit there. And then I’d also add in the supply as you expect and largely, no on those large markets tend to be more urban and suburban balance that we have has helped us there as well.
John Pawlowski: Yes. Thank you very much.
Operator: We will take our final question from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Buck Horne: Yes. thanks for keeping the call going along. I appreciate it. I’m going to ask one question then. Single-family rentals, thinking about you’re seeing a lot of home builders validate the concept getting into purpose built communities of single family rentals that can operate like horizontal apartments with an amenity, maybe, in more kind of outlined locations, but definitely, Sunbelt. Does a concept like a purpose built single-family rental community potentially, offer you anything attractive in terms of diversifying the product mix, or how do you think about that concept going forward?
Eric Bolton: Well, Buck, it is something that we’ve been talking about a bit. I do think that if you get a purpose built single-family rental community, where you get, if you will, all the homes in a very organized, defined sort of community footprint, let’s see, along the lines of what you just described kind of a horizontal multifamily plan, if you will. Then yes, we think that there may be some logic to that. We are – we’ve seen a few examples from time to time and should – right now, of course, that that kind of opportunity is attracting a ton of capital. So, pricing is pretty competitive, but should the opportunity present itself for something that along the lines of what you’re describing it would be something we would take a hard look at for sure.
Buck Horne: All right, great. Thanks. Congrats, guys. Appreciate it.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Buck.
Tom Grimes: Thanks, Buck.
Operator: Thanks. No further questions. I’ll return the call to MAA for any closing remarks.
Tim Argo: No further comments. So, appreciate everyone joining us this morning and let us know if you have any additional questions. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MAA Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, October 29, 2020. I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. 
Tim Argo: Thank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO, Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Brad Hill, Executive Vice President and Head of Transactions. 
 Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release, and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website. 
 During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the for Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. 
 I will now turn the call over to Eric. 
H. Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and appreciate everyone joining us this morning. Results for the third quarter were ahead of our expectations. Cash collections on rents build in the third quarter were strong and October trends are the same. While we still have a long way to go in capturing full economic recovery, we are encouraged by the early signs of improvement evident in our third quarter results. Leasing traffic was well ahead of prior year. On a lease-over-lease basis, new move in rent pricing meaningfully improved as compared to the second quarter. 
 Overall, net effective rents were 1.8% higher than Q3 of last year and average daily occupancy remained strong at 95.6%. As a result, we captured positive sequential revenue growth in each of our markets as compared to the second quarter. Demand is strong across our footprint and growing. While we expect new supply levels to remain elevated for the next few quarters, forecast for new deliveries and the trends for permits for new construction suggest moderation in deliveries beginning in the back half of next year and significantly declining into 2022. 
 We continue to make progress on our new development pipeline with construction and scheduled deliveries on track to our performance where we are underway with initial leasing, both our leasing trajectory and rents are in line with our expectations. We are in active predevelopment work on several other new development projects that we hope to start next year. We believe MAA's strategy, with a focus on the Sunbelt region uniquely diversified across both large and mid-tier markets and serving a broad segment of the rental market. 
 As the company well positioned to continue to work through the challenges presented by the current economic slowdown. As the economy begins to recover post COVID, we believe our markets will continue to outperform, capturing employment trends and a demand for housing that will be well above national averages. 
 MAA is well positioned for a coming recovery cycle. To our team of MAA associates, thank you for your tremendous work and commitment to our mission over the busy summer leasing season. You have again exceeded expectations, and as a result, have us well positioned as we head into next year. 
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. 
Thomas L. Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. The recovery we saw beginning in May and June continued across the portfolio through a busy season. Leasing volume for the quarter was up 11%. This allowed us to improve average daily occupancy from 95.4% in the second quarter to 95.6% in the third quarter. 
 In addition to strengthening occupancy by 20 basis points, we were also able to drive new lease pricing improvement. Effective new lease pricing during the quarter improved 140 basis points from the second quarter to the third. All in-place rents on a year-over-year basis were up 1.8%, and turnover for the quarter was down 2.7% versus last year. 
 These improvements were supported by an increase in lead-generating marketing spending. We're pleased with the resulting improvements in occupancy and new lease pricing mentioned earlier. We saw steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. During the second quarter, we restarted our interior unit redevelopment program as well as installation of our smart home technology package. That includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. 
 Year-to-date, we have installed 22,000 smart home packages and completed 3,300 interior unit upgrades. As noticed in the supplemental document collections during the quarter were strong. We've worked diligently to identify and support those who need help because of COVID-19. The number of those seeking assistants dropped with each month. In April, we had 5,600 residents on the relief plans. The number of participants decreased over time and it's just 470 for the October rental assistance plan. This represents less than 0.5% of our 100,000 units. 
 October collections are running slightly ahead of the good results we saw in the third quarter. As of October 26, we've collected 98.6% of rent build for October. This is a 20 basis point improvement from what we saw on average for July, August and September for the same-day of the month, including deferred payments for COVID-19 effective resident payment plans referenced in the COVID-19 disclosure, we have accounted for 98.8% of October build rent. 
 Leasing volume for October is on track to exceed last year. Effective new lease pricing for October-to-date is negative 2%, a 30 basis point improvement from the third quarter, effective blended lease-over-lease pricing for October month-to-date is 1.3%, a 50 basis point improvement from the third quarter. A high percentage of our current residents are choosing to stay with us, and our resident renewal and retention trends are positive. October, November and December lease-over-lease renewal rates signed at this time are in the 4.5% to 5.5% range. 
 In addition to the positive leasing trends, occupancy has also strengthened. Occupancy has improved from a low point of 95.1% in May to 95.7% today. Average daily occupancy for the month is 95.6%, which is even with October of last year. 60-day exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, has dropped from a high of 9.2% in May to 6.8% in October. This low level of exposure also matches the same time last year and has us well positioned for the slower winter leasing season. 
 I'd like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well. They served and cared for our residents and our associates well and have grappled with the constantly changing implications COVID-19. They've also worked diligently to adapt to new business conditions and drive our recovery. I'm proud of them and grateful for their efforts and character. Brad? 
Brad Hill: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter transaction volume picked up from second quarter, but still remains down significantly year-over-year, and we expect the volume to continue to be slow into next year. Because of the desirability of our markets, we continue to see robust buyer demand for existing assets within our footprint. This strong demand, coupled with very attractive debt rates, has further compressed cap rates, and in some cases, is resulting in pricing above pre-COVID levels, despite lower NOI's. We continue to expect our best buying opportunities on existing assets to be owned properties and their initial lease-up, where we believe pressure is likely to continue to build through the winter. 
 With that said, we've only seen a few lease-up opportunities come up and pricing trends are mixed. All cash buyers and strong sponsors with established agency relationships remain the most aggressive bidders, while leverage buyers are having more difficulty obtaining financing on prestabilized properties. We do expect cap rates within our footprint to remain at historical lows and perhaps continue to trend lower, likely making acquisitions a smaller contributor to our external growth for some time. 
 As mentioned last quarter, we expect our in-house development and our prepurchase platform to be significant contributors to our external growth going forward and anticipate starting construction on a number of these projects later this year and into next. While cap rates on acquisitions have compressed, yields on developments remain attractive. Rents and occupancy are holding up in our markets and despite cost pressure in a couple of line items, especially lumber, developments continue to underwrite to a positive spread to cap rates on stabilized properties. 
 As shown in our supplemental, we have 6 development projects that are underway and all remain on budget and on-time, despite working through some minor supply chain issues. Subsequent to quarter end, we started construction on the land parcel in the northern suburb of Austin that we purchased back in January. This 350 unit project should begin leasing in the first half of 2022, when we expect leasing conditions to be significantly stronger than they are today. 
 While early reports show 2021 deliveries in line with this year's levels, data and permitting and construction starts show a material decline since March and point to a drop in future deliveries beginning late next year and into 2022, lining up well with the expected delivery of any new development we start. 
 That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn it over to Al. 
Albert M. Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. We reported core FFO of $1.57 per share for the quarter, which was slightly better than our internal expectations as operating performance, corporate overhead costs and interest costs were all better-than-expected for the quarter. As mentioned earlier, stable occupancy, strong builds in effective rents and continued strong collection supported the third quarter performance, while improving pricing trends position the portfolio well for the fourth quarter. 
 As Tom mentioned -- excuse me, we have established a reserve for bad debts at quarter end sufficient to fully cover uncollected rent from rests not working with us on payment plans as well as for a large portion of the remaining deferral program payments. Our collections experience for those have been very good today. 
 As discussed in our release last quarter, we expected some pressure in property operating expenses over the back half of the year. The majority of the increase for the third quarter was related to growth in real estate taxes, insurance and marketing costs as well as impact on a utility costs on the double-play bulk Internet program, all discussed last quarter. 
 A couple of unusual items affecting the quarter were an unexpected increase in Austin tax rates related to a recent approval by the city to bring forward funding for a light rail system, which was approved during the quarter and actually goes before voters next week. In addition, we did occur about $750,000 of unexpected storm cleanup costs during the third quarter, which also contributed to the growth. 
 Our balance sheet remains strong, with low leverage and significant capacity from cash and remaining borrowing potential under our line of credit, combining for $980 million of capacity. We funded $50 million of development costs during the quarter with the expectation of funding around $260 million for the full year, including the purchase of land parcels for future deals. 
 As Brad mentioned, the acquisition environment remains challenging, so we expect the majority of investment opportunities over the next few quarters to be in-house development or pre purchase development deals, which both have long-term funding commitments. And thus, we expect our development pipeline to increase over the next few quarters, but remain well within the risk tolerance ranges we've always had. 
 We completed a successful bond deal early in the quarter, taking advantage of the low rate environment to issue $450 million of 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 1.7%. This funding was ultimately used to repay some secured debt maturing later this year as well as prepay a $300 million term loan during in 2022. We have no remaining current maturities or future maturities with low prepayment costs, so we don't anticipate additional debt or equity funding needs for the remainder of this year. 
 And finally, as reflected in our release, recent trends have been encouraging, there's still significant uncertainties remaining, thus, we refrained from providing guidance for the remainder of the year, but plan to revisit the decision as we prepare for our fourth quarter release with the expectation of being able to provide guidance for 2021. 
 That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Ashley, we will now turn the call over to you for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. 
John Kim: Al, you just mentioned that there are some uncertainties remaining that basically allowed you to refrain from providing guidance for the year. Can you just elaborate on what some of those uncertainties are at this point? 
Albert M. Campbell: Yes, John, I appreciate that question. I think as we look at whether there's continuation of certain government programs, the recent potential rise in COVID cases in our region, timing of reopening plans that continue in our region related to these states. And so all these things continue to bring risk. And as we mentioned, I mean, we are very encouraged with the trends, but just given that it was 1 quarter remaining in the year, we felt it prudent to refrain completing that out right now. We hope to be and feel like we'll be in a position, assuming continued stability in overall marketplace and environment to put full guidance out for 2021. 
John Kim: And with your cost of capital coming down, at least on the debt side, with your recent debt raise of 1.7. How does this change at all as far as how you underwrite investments? 
Albert M. Campbell: I don't want to change. I mean, we continue to underwrite in a similar manner. I think what it does is it certainly provides the potential for very strong yields, gaps and the spread capture on some of these new development deals that brand, whether they're in-house development or prepurchase. And so that's why we talked about the remaining -- the capacity we have. And also, we talked about in the past, John, that we have a potential on our balance sheet to invest in $750 million before really impacting our leverage level. 
 So I think we would say that -- and I talked about in the comments this morning, we do expect over the next couple of quarters on development pipeline to grow because that's where the opportunity is. And as you point out, those 6 yields that we're putting in place compared to that [ 1 to 7 ] debt funding cost is very attractive. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. 
Nicholas Joseph: It's obviously been a very different operating year thus far. So I'm wondering how you're thinking about seasonality versus the normal patterns and how that impacts your operating strategy over the next few months in terms of focusing on occupancy or rate? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes. Nick, it's Tom. I think what we've enjoyed thus far, frankly, is pricing that has been unseasonal as you mentioned, normally our effect of new lease pricing peaks late July. Thus far, its peaked late August -- or excuse me, late October, with steady trends as it goes. I would expect, as we move into the fourth quarter, that we would see a seasonal falloff in sort of demand as we usually do and that new lease pricing will drop modestly, and that we'll be able to hold on or in the range of our current level of occupancy. That said, what I think will continue to grow, which are renewal rates that were effective in the third quarter or just 3.8. I think we'll see renewal rates continue to improve as we move through the fourth quarter. That's not something that's usual that seasonal, and that we'll see those in the 4.5% to 5.5% range for the fourth quarter. 
Nicholas Joseph: And then just maybe specifically on D.C., it's a little unique relative to the rest of your portfolio. So what are you seeing on the ground there? And how you use in any concession? 
Thomas L. Grimes: I'm sorry, Nick, I missed which market you were asking about? 
Nicholas Joseph: Washington, D.C. and the Greater [indiscernible] area. 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, absolutely. Yes, D.C. is a little bit different. Honestly, occupancy there is strong at 96.4%. The pricing has been weak. And as we go around the horn, we're seeing concession levels in D.C. Proper at 2 months unstabilized; Pentagon City, Crystal City, about 2 months; Tyson's corner, 2 months; Alexandria, pretty similar; Maryland and Northern Virginia are a little bit stronger, but both seeing a month 3 in those markets. So D.C. is 1 where we're stable on occupancy, but pricing growth remains elusive at the moment. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. 
Austin Wurschmidt: Just curious, you referenced permitting levels declining. Fundamentals have been relatively stable and supply is expected to fall off. I guess, why do you think there hasn't been a pickup in construction activity at this point? Anything the supply chain challenges, I think you referenced or difficulty getting financing? And then just curious if there's any offsetting items from the pressure on lumber prices that Brad referenced and where you think kind of construction costs are versus pre-COVID levels? 
Brad Hill: Austin, this is Brad. I think certainly, in terms of construction costs, we've seen a strong rise in lumber, but it's been pretty volatile. We've seen a strong run-up since COVID. We have seen some relief there in the last 30 days or so, but it's still a pretty big unknown in terms of our construction cost. And we're really not seeing any other line items at the moment that are providing relief or offsetting some of that. It's just not happening. At the moment, in terms of seeing our -- not seeing construction tick up based on the permitting data we're seeing, I think it's -- I think financing is certainly a big part of that. When we started out of COVID equity was a little nervous. And so second quarter was tough. Equity folks backed out of a number of development deals. That's kind of -- since it's come back. 
 And now I think the difficulty is more on the construction side or getting construction loans, that's very, very difficult for folks at the moment. And I think that's giving us some additional opportunities on our prepurchase platform, just based on the way we've structured that. But I think fundamentally, our markets continue to underwrite well for new development. You've got the -- certainly, the construction cost pressure a bit, but we see some mitigating circumstances there being the lower supply that we're talking about at late 2021 and into 2022 that the permitting data is showing. So we feel good about anything that we are developing today and putting a shovel on the ground on today. But I think the financing environment for folks -- for a number of folks out there is a little bit more difficult. 
Austin Wurschmidt: How robust is that pipeline of prepurchase opportunities? Has there been any change in pricing there? And then do you think as the transaction market general loosens up that maybe that spurs a little more activity in the construction market? 
Brad Hill: Perhaps. I mean, in terms of the -- what we're seeing on the prepurchase side, I mean, again, we're evaluating a lot of deals. As equity-backed out in the second quarter, we had a lot come forward to us. And then as I said, we've got our ability to provide the debt on our prepurchase platform is kind of a differentiator for us. And for folks that -- a lot of the established developers that we're doing business with, they have the capacity and the ability to go out and get debt, but we just provide a better option for them. So we're seeing a lot of opportunities there. We've got 2 that we hope to start in the coming quarters and in others that are in daily for us to evaluate. So we're optimistic that, that platform continues to perform and to provide opportunities for us. 
H. Bolton: And Austin, this is Eric. I'll add to what Brad is saying that we've got repurchase opportunities or predevelopment opportunities, I'll say, that we're working, including both in-house and on the prepurchase platform that Brad mentioned. We're working opportunities that we have tied up in Tampa, Raleigh, Denver, Phoenix. we're also actually looking at opportunity in a new market for us of Salt Lake City, which we hope we can start on next year. So we've got a number of things we're looking at. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Neil Malkin with Capital One Securities. 
Neil Malkin: First off, congrats to your collections are remarkable as if there is no pandemic though. You guys are obviously doing something right. First question, I've been hearing more anecdotally about this, and I think it's increased with COVID. But are you seeing more inflow at your market from California, New York, Boston into Sunbelt Phoenix market? I think have you noticed a tick up since April. Any commentary there on how people are choosing to live now that remote -- work remotely is more accepted and the need -- the desire to get away from the sort of densely populated areas has increased? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Sure, Neil. We've seen -- we didn't see much of that in the second quarter, but it's picked up in the third quarter. And most of the -- majority of our move-ins come from within the Sunbelt. So keep in mind that these numbers that I'm going to throw at you represent a relatively low percentage of our total move-ins. But they are growing. So New York -- move-ins from New York is up double digits; moving from Massachusetts are up about 9.2%; Pennsylvania 10%; and California, almost 8%. And then sort of anecdotally, we spend a good amount of time digging into the Google Analytics stuff. We're also seeing searches from those areas. For instance, like if you pick a search phrase like apartments in Atlanta, that's up 44% over prior year from addresses in the New York area. Apartments in Raleigh is up 22% from our searches in the Massachusetts area. So it's not a driver of our business at this point, but there's certainly evidence to suggest that this is a continuing trend. 
Neil Malkin: Yes. I appreciate that. Other question I have is on the single-family side. Your markets are great. The one thing is the home prices are more affordable, but just wondering given the increase in homeownership, mortgage applications, new and existing home sales, are you seeing any increase in the move-out for home purchases or single-family rental, again but over the same sort of like since maybe April and May. Any color there would be great? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes. On new home buying, that's remained relatively flat at 19.5% of our move-outs. So that has been steady as it goes. And then move out to single-family rentals have stayed well below 6%. Certainly, those are -- those businesses are doing well out there, but we're not seeing them drive an increase in turnover at this point. And we think people are with our demographic, which is in majority female, single and not at the phase where they're making those changes. We are not -- we're just not seeing a ton of shift in that direction in our move-outs. 
Neil Malkin: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just along, how many people not answered those surveys? Like those percentages you're did 10% of the people move out the surveys. Is it 50%? It's like how good of a sample size is that? 
Thomas L. Grimes: It's roughly 100%. I mean we don't -- I'd say roughly just because I hadn't checked the number in the last couple of days, but that is -- we -- that's not a survey that's sent after the fact. That is a -- when you offer a notice to us, that's a required field for them to fill out and capture. So it is -- that's where we're getting that information. It is a part of our transaction for accepting the notice. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. 
Nicholas Yulico: Just a question on renewals. It's impressive you guys have been able to keep your renewals close to 5% in terms of the growth. How do you guys feel about still being able to stay in that 4% to 5% range in this environment? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Pretty confident in and just to reset a little bit, in Q3, the renewals came down to 3.8%. And now we're seeing them move back in the 4.5% and 5%. Honestly, our 2 to 3-year average, there's probably 6%. So we're still a little below that. We feel quite confident in our ability to continue to maintain those rates as long as we continue to do our job and create value for our residents. We feel like renewals is a place where we have the most pricing power, and that hasn't changed through this process. So we feel confident in our ability to continue that. 
H. Bolton: Yes. And I would add, Nick, that I think people are probably a little -- residents are a little bit more sticky right now than perhaps they've ever been just as a consequence of COVID and the challenges of moving have always been there, but with COVID on the landscape, I think it probably helps in that regard as well. So we continue to feel that now is the time to -- as Tom says, if we're doing a great job on service, which I know we are at our locations, it makes sense to continue to push that to the extent that we monitor how much move out we're creating as a consequence of that and ready to back off and if we need to. But at this point, no signs that we need to do that. 
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. Thanks, Eric. I think Sumit Sharma has a question as well. 
Sumit Sharma: Guys, just really quickly, we've been listening to a lot of developers in your markets talk about an increase in investment. So maybe you could walk us through some of the markets where you're seeing the most supply growth? And importantly, and this might be a long-term question, but still very interested. How concerned are you on shadow supply growth, let's say, from older office buildings or retail redevelopments? 
Brad Hill: Well, this is Brad. I think in terms of the shadow development, I don't think we're seeing a lot of that in our markets at the moment. I think what we certainly see is the repurposing of retail spaces into apartments, but the retail getting torn down. I think we're doing that at our West property in Denver, where we're tearing down an older underutilized retail space to put in apartments. I think we'll see some of that. But I don't know that we're going to see -- we're certainly not seeing right now repurposing of hotels or anything like that within our markets at the moment. But in terms of supply that we're seeing increases in, let me get my reply… 
Thomas L. Grimes: I think in terms of looking forward on that, we're in the process of really going through our study, Fred's team does an unbelievable job. They're really diving into the markets and understanding and what the implications are for us for 2021. So we're doing our study of the market. We're doing our study of the radius of our market exactly how it affects us. And we'll have more on that in the fourth quarter. But what we are showing really is a falloff in supply in the back half of year for a range of reasons that were mentioned earlier. 
Sumit Sharma: [indiscernible] anyone else? 
Thomas L. Grimes: I'm sorry, we didn't understand that. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. 
Alex Kalmus: So obviously, you have pretty strong top line growth compared to some of your peers that we're seeing in the urban market. Do you attribute the success figure [indiscernible] success reasoning? Would it be more because you're the urban footprint of your markets? Or is this a market selection? 
Albert M. Campbell: Well, I think that if you look at our portfolio, I think that it really is -- it starts with the overall Sunbelt footprint, obviously, but where we are seeing stronger performance occur is particularly in some of our mid-tier markets where the supply pressures at the moment are not quite as significant. So some of our mid-Tier component of our strategy, mid-tier market component of our footprint is certainly helpful at this point. And then if you look at a submarket level, we have a higher percent of our portfolio is suburban in non-urban core. And that orientation of the portfolio, I think, is also a big contributor to our ability to sort of weather these downturns in a better fashion. 
Alex Kalmus: Got it. And turning to the smart home units. I'm assuming you're installing those on turns, but there is some lease-over-lease declines in the new lease. So should we think of this $25 premium as a mitigant to the declines? Or is there some sort of A/B testing that drives that 25 premium? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes. So we're actually doing those on turns and occupied and really, the majority, we just got back on it in the third quarter, and most of those units got completed a late third quarter. So when we have -- we do not -- when we do it on an occupied unit, we do not immediately put that price increase on it resets at the renewal. And then on new leases, we rent them with it. And that is a bump, but it is not a material bump in the third quarter, a lease-over-lease new lease numbers. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. 
Robert Stevenson: Tom, when you adjust for urban versus suburban or just looking at sort of the suburban asset, et cetera, any differential in operating performance between price point within the various markets? Mean, in other words, a $2 square foot suburban, 2 bedroom, leasing any differently than $1.75, any difference of price point between sort of same product, same market or submarket? And then any difference in demand between larger and smaller floor plates the 850 square foot 2-bedroom units versus the 1,100 square foot, 2-bedroom units? Any color there? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes. Consistently, across the board, I mean you've touched on urban is -- our suburbans running a little stronger than urban. And then also a or higher price point is running a little weaker than B. B is strong. So B suburban is the best, and that plays out whether you're in the suburban or in the urban areas. On the unit types, it is -- we're majority 1 in 2 bedrooms. And in terms of our current exposure level and the current lease level growth for 1s and 2s, they're incredibly consistent. 1s are slightly ahead of 2, but it's by a negligible amount. The floor plan that is a little less popular right now is our efficiencies. They are running closer to 95% occupied on an average basis with more like 8% exposure and not terribly surprising. But to put that in perspective, that efficiencies are 4% of our exposure and 1s and 2s are like 88%. So the one little less favorable floor plan that we have right now is just 4% exposure. 
Robert Stevenson: Then what about bigger versus smaller within the same number of bedrooms, like that large -- are the large 2 bedrooms now getting more attention for people looking for that extra space than the smaller 2 bedrooms. People looking for that extra 150, 200 square feet. 
Thomas L. Grimes: I think that's honestly skewed a little bit by the A/B because our B assets and suburban assets tend to be a little bit larger. So if we looked at the numbers, yes, that would be the case. But I think that has to do with more the construction type and just sort of differences between our B product and our suburban product versus our A product and our urban product. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then the other one for me is, are you guys seeing any markets that appear to be deteriorating on you noticeably, operationally at this point where you expect as you head into 2021, the things are going to continue to get weaker, adjusting for whatever happens with the economy, but where today, it looks weaker than it did last month? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Not a dramatic falloff. I think Houston and D.C., we're watching carefully as well as Orlando. But those are more sort of like bumping along than falling off materially. 
Operator: We will take the next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. 
John Pawlowski: Tom, maybe just following up on a market question. You touched about supply in some of this -- maybe it was Eric, lower supply in some of the secondary markets. In the quarter, sequentially, your smaller markets really outperformed your larger markets. Curious if there was an outsized lift from the Double Play package? Or if it's just true organic demand or supply, differences versus the larger markets? 
Thomas L. Grimes: No. I mean, double play is really spread across the portfolio by tight fairly evenly. So no, there is not -- it is not that Double Play is not adversely or positively affecting one market or the other on the revenue or expense on. 
John Pawlowski: Okay. And then, Al, last question for me. You talked about Austin property taxes. Nashville in recent months has increased property taxes as well. Are there any other markets you're hearing chatter across the Sunbelt where just property taxes to fund the growth of cities and infrastructure cities is becoming more topical? 
Albert M. Campbell: Certainly a topical conversation right now. I wouldn't say that there's informal areas that where we're seeing right now that would be the next one to be a significant increase. Certainly going into the year, Nashville and Austin, both unexpected and were significant increases. And some question that a lot of municipalities are dealing with budget issues now. And so we're certainly watching that and monitoring. I think it's not just us in our region, it's nationwide in many markets. I would say this year, you're not seeing valuation relief yet because people are looking backwards. Maybe as we move into next year, you get a little bit of valuation relief and then the millage rates they're still in question because of all these issues that the municipalities are dealing with. So we're watching that closely, John. That's a long answer to say nothing specific, but certainly top of mind right now. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. 
Richard Skidmore: Just a follow-up, perhaps I missed it, but what's driving the 2% decline in new lease rate in October? Is that just supply in the markets? Because it seems like you've talked about strong demand and good occupancy, just -- and lower turnovers. So I'm just trying to understand what's happening there. 
Thomas L. Grimes: No. I mean I think it's just a difference in timing and seasonality. So from -- on an effective basis or when new lease rates that moved in, in October, they're actually up sequentially. New leases if you're looking at the new leases if you're looking at the supplemental or down slightly, which is what I mentioned earlier, I think we'll see normal seasonal trends on pricing as we head into November, December. The odd thing is, is that new lease pricing climbed, honestly, from May to October. And usually, it peaks in July for effective. And then the other thing that will be different for us in the fourth quarter in terms of pricing is that you're going to see renewal rates move back up into the 4.5% and 5% range, whereas normally, they might be coming down from 7% to 6% or 5.5% in a normal seasonal pattern. 
Richard Skidmore: And then just a follow-up. Al, you talked about the new development pipeline and being within the historical range. Can you just frame for us what that historical range should be as some of these projects that you have are moving off being completed in 2021, what sort of scale we might be thinking, whether it's number of projects, number units, total capital, however you might frame that new supply pipeline? 
Albert M. Campbell: I think what I was trying to indicate was we've talked about a range of tolerance we would have for our pipeline overall, given our balance sheet. And typically, we've said 4% or 5% of our balance sheet, of course, an $18 billion balance sheet, that's a significant number. And so I think we would see -- we're certainly -- I made the comment because the opportunities that Brad mentioned, will be there in the development pre purchase as well as in house. The yields are very good relative to financing costs. We'll certainly see that increase. And we have room in our balance sheet to use that for a while to fund those maintaining -- I put the range out there. Over the long term, we certainly want to protect and maintain our balance sheet ratios where they are. So 4% to 5%, that gives you $800 million or so, a little more we could work with. And in the long term, we'll probably see that come back down into where we are now over a long period of time. 
Operator: We'll go next to Amanda with Baird. 
Amanda Sweitzer: Great. I wanted to ask on your renovation project, and it was certainly nice to see kind of the slight acceleration in the rent premium achieved for those units. But are there any markets today where you pause renovations due to more challenging fundamentals? And then how are you thinking about the potential pipeline for renovation or redevelopment projects next year? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes. No. Thanks for the question, Amanda. And yes, there is some difference. We brought back about 80% of our units. And 80% of the properties where we're doing a redevelopment. And we do A/B testing there on a regular basis. And we did not feel in the results that we're seeing on the ground that it made sense to bring redevelopment back in Houston or Orlando at this time. We'll monitor those, and those are markets we feel good about long term. But one of the nice things about the redevelopment project, the way we do it is we can be relatively nimble in response to on-the-ground market conditions and just it made sense to pause those in those markets. 
H. Bolton: And Amanda, we are looking at our '21 plans at the moment, and we'd expect to see another productive year on redevelopment. And then also, we've got a number of more extensive repositioning efforts in projects that we will likely kick off next year as well. 
Amanda Sweitzer: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick clarification on some of your earlier migration comments. Are you still seeing movements from outside the Sunbelt remain in kind of that 8% to 10% historical range you've talked about? Or is it now running ahead of that with the growth you're talking about? 
Thomas L. Grimes: It's about 11% or 12%, now. 
Operator: We will take our question from Anderson with SMBC. 
Richard Anderson: Tom, I want to not get too nitty-gritty here, but for the October move-ins up 4.8% on renewals and those that were signed up 5.8%. That's basically the foreshadow you're talking about in terms of renewals going up. I assume as we kind of venture into the fourth quarter here, but is that 100 basis point spread move in versus signed a typical spread? Or is it particularly higher or low right now versus other years? 
Thomas L. Grimes: No, it's particularly hot right now. Usually, there's not much spread at all because our renewals are pretty consistent. But because renewals came down in the -- in terms of what our renewal offers were came down in June and July, those that then moved in 60 days out are lower. And then as our markets sort of stabilized and the picture became clearer on the impact of the economy in our market and we were seeing people stay and felt like we had pricing power then we began to move back to more of our normal practice. So normally, there's a pretty tight delta between those 2 numbers. But we're just on the incline at this point. And I would think as we stabilize, then you'll begin to see that delta tighten, but the overall renewal rates will be at a pretty high level at that point. 
Richard Anderson: Right. Okay. Right. I guess I was getting signed confused with offers. But -- okay. That makes sense. And then the second question, maybe big picture for Eric. Talking a lot about urban versus urban, but I bet your urban portfolio is doing better than northern cities or coastal cities. Maybe that's an obvious statement. And I'm wondering if you think, is this a red state, blue state thing? I mean, not to get political because that's not the intention. But do your typical residents have perhaps a far less sensitivity factor when it comes to COVID-19. And so they're more inclined to move around and do what they have to do to get into other apartment? Or is that hard to sort of gauge and so you don't really know? My guess is you're in Trump country there that, that would be the case. But again, not a political conversation, but I'm wondering just how people think about this kind of stuff and if it's playing a role in your business? 
H. Bolton: Well, Rich, there are 2 questions there. One is, you're right, we are not seeing nearly the pressure on our urban product that you're seeing on urban product in San Francisco and New York. Our turnover move-outs from our urban locations are down this year versus last year. So where we see pressure on urban performance more as a function of supply coming into the market because more often than not, at the moment, that supply is higher in price point and more urban oriented. 
 But, yes, our urban product is holding up relatively pretty well. The other part of your question is, as you suggest, is really difficult to answer. I think that largely, what we are seeing benefit of is a --states, in cities in a broad region that just tends to be viewed as more, if you will, pro-business bringing -- employers are bringing jobs to this region of the country. Employers are bringing and relocating jobs out of some of these higher cost areas of the country. This is clearly a more affordable region in the country to live in, a more moderate weather challenges and just -- I think it has a lot of appeal. 
 And I think that the behaviors that -- I mean, we're seeing these markets starting to open up perhaps a little quicker and in a robust -- more robust way that we see -- have seen take place in other regions of the country. And I don't know whether that's sort of a red/blue thing or whether it's just more a different mindset that's hard to really attribute to political issues or anything of that nature. I just think that it is what it is. And these cities and these states are going to be much more inclined to just move forward with business in this environment. And we're seeing some benefit of that. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. 
Jonathan Petersen: Curious if you're seeing any new capital coming to your markets in terms of competition for acquisitions or funding new developments? Just thinking, you're hearing from a lot of private guys that have basically shunned office and retail and coastal apartments, but obviously, fundamentals are doing well in your markets. Just curious if you've seen any change in kind of new capital that's chasing your property type in your geographies? 
Brad Hill: Jon, this is Brad. Certainly, we're seeing a lot of capital in our market. Everybody that was interested in multifamily certainly is still interested in multifamily. And certainly, in the third quarter, we've seen of the folks that have been on the sidelines is kind of come back into the market and start looking for acquisitions, which -- that's one of the things that's driving and impacting pricing is there's just not a lot of deals and a lot of capital looking for it. 
 I'd say one thing that we have seen that's changed and has been more pronounced is a number of investors that generally have targeted the Northeast have come into our market. And I think the way they look at some of our assets on a price per pound basis is a little bit different than what traditional Southeast investors do. And I think that, that is also driving pricing a bit, but we've seen a lot more participation from Northeast investors in our markets. And that's really the only change that we've seen. I think international capital is down a bit in our markets, but that's more than made up for by other capital sources. And then I'd say that private REITs are certainly very strong. They had a few months of low capital raising, which that's back up. And so those folks are back aggressively in the market. So… 
Operator: Next is Zach Silverberg with Mizuho. 
Zachary Silverberg: So my first one is about some comments you made earlier on Salt Lake City. I'm just curious what other markets you consider entering? And would your plan be to enter in some sort of scale or via opportunistic one-offs? And what do IRRs and cap rates look like versus your core markets? 
Thomas L. Grimes: No. I mean, Salt Lake is the only market that -- new market that we have intentionally targeted, and we have been working on that opportunity for some time. We've liked that market for quite some time. It's a -- the market has some challenges to get into, but we think we've got a way to get there, and we actually got, hopefully, several other opportunities behind the one we're currently working that would enable us over time to scale up there in a sufficient fashion. But we see the sort of underwriting dynamics and pricing there, very similar to how we see a number of our other Sunbelt markets and a lot of buyer interest. That's a market that continues to track just a great job growth, great quality of life, very affordable, employers like that a lot so we really like the long-term dynamics there. And it's just -- we've been disciplined about looking for the right way to get there and get into the market. And we've got a prepurchase opportunity that Brad and his team have been working on and hopefully, more to follow. 
Zachary Silverberg: Got it. Appreciate that. And just one more from me. You sort of touched upon this in the prepared remarks in the press release that you worked with residents to stay in their homes. Can you quantify the amount of tenants to request the assistance? And how has that trended since the start of pandemic? And where does that sort of show up in your financials? 
Albert M. Campbell: Yes. So the -- I mean, it shows up in the financials on the amount of rent outstanding. But we started with -- in April, we had 5,600 people on a rental assistance plan; in May, we had 5,100; in June, it was down to 2,000; July 529, and then we've stayed below 500 through October. So it's continued to remain steady and trend down, and the results of that are in our numbers. So those are what we've really found. We took some risk with working with these folks, but even for a jaded landlord, it's been impressive to see how well those folks have lived up to their obligation. We gave them a little bit of time, and they've come through very strong, and they've paid us. 
Zachary Silverberg: Got you. And just one quick follow-up on Salt Lake. Could you provide any sort of cap rate or IRR color if you guys have that at your disposal? 
Albert M. Campbell: What I'd tell you, we're still in our predevelopment work on that and more to come on that as we get that buttoned up and which we hope to do early next year. 
Operator: There appears to be no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to you, Mr. Argo for any addition or closing remarks. 
Tim Argo: Thank you, Ashley. I appreciate everybody joining us on the call, and please reach out if you have any more questions. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you and this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 30, 2020. I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA.
Tim Argo: Thank you Ashley and good morning everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO, Al Campbell, our CFO, Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel, Tom Grimes, our COO and Brad Hill, Executive Vice President and Head of Transactions. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Tim. Results for the second quarter were ahead of expectations as strong collections drove NOI performance above our internal forecast. Due to both the high quality of our portfolio and the proactive efforts by our team to work with residents impacted by the pandemic, we expect continued solid performance with collections. Encouragingly, the trends for rent payments improved over the course of the quarter. And as Tom will touch on, the positive trends continued in July, with fewer residents seeking rent deferral arrangements. As of the 27th of the month, our cash collections for July rent were a strong 98.1% which compares favorably to an average Q2 performance on a comparable basis at 96.4%. We are monitoring reports of increased levels of COVID cases in a number of Sunbelt markets. While we expect conditions will remain fluid and choppy across various states and markets, we are optimistic that efforts to reopen local businesses and economies will continue. Beyond the uncertainties associated with how various state and local economies will proceed to reopen, questions associated with actions by the federal government to extend support to individuals and businesses also remain unresolved. For these reasons, we continue to feel that conditions remain too uncertain to provide updated earnings guidance. However, as outlined in our supplemental pages to the press release, we will continue to provide more details surrounding current rent collections and leasing trends. Assuming there is no significant change in current conditions, we believe that we will continue to capture solid collections on billed rent as well as continued low resident turnover and stable occupancy. We do expect continued pressure on rent growth, but we were encouraged with the improvement in lease-over-lease pricing for leases signed in July. With a significant percentage of our leases re-pricing during the busy summer leasing season, it is important to keep in mind that we will carry these re-priced units into early leasing season next year and it will weigh on the cumulative performance of overall rent growth for the next three quarters or so. However, as new supply deliveries slow next year, we expect a resumption of more robust rent growth across our markets. Longer term, we believe that our Sunbelt markets will capture increasingly stronger trends in adding new employers, job growth and new household formations. Our unique approach to diversifying across this robust region of the country with high quality communities, supported by a sophisticated operating platform will, we believe, continue to drive long term outperformance for capital. Further, our strong balance sheet puts us in a solid position to both weather the current economic slowdown as well as opportunistically pursue compelling opportunities that emerge. In closing, I want to express my appreciation and thanks to our MAA associates for their dedication and superior service throughout the stressful second quarter. Your performance and commitment to our mission of serving our residents and all who depend on MAA, during these stressful times has been absolutely incredible. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Grimes: Thank you Eric and good morning everyone. I will offer a short recap on the second quarter and then move to trends that we have seen through July. The initial slowdown in demand triggered by COVID-19 in late March has moderated and trends are improving. Our teams have adapted and have been effective using our virtual self-tour platform. These practices were further augmented by our return to guided tours in May. Leasing volume in April was down versus prior year by 9% of volume and May and June were strong enough and leasing volume for the quarter was 0.6% higher than last year. Effective rents were up 3.4% and blended lease-over-lease pricing including concessions was up 1.2%. Occupancy remained steady at 95.4%. And turnover for the quarter was down 7% versus last year. We saw steady interest in our product upgrade initiatives. During the quarter, we restarted our interior unit redevelopment program as well as the installation of our Smart Home technology package that includes mobile control of lights, thermostat and security as well as leak detection. As noted in the supplemental document, collections during the quarter were strong, we worked diligently to identify and support those who needed help as a result of COVID-19. The number of those seeking assistance has dropped with each month. In April, we had 5,600 residents on relief plans. The number of participants decreased each month thereafter and it's just 530 for the July rental assistance plan. This represents 0.5% of our 100,000 units. As a reminder, in addition to the flexible payment plans for those affected by COVID-19, we have not charged late fees, we have frozen eviction proceedings and actively worked to pair affected residents with local and national support resources. While we are still below our normal run rate, the reduction in the number of residents on a rental assistance planned aided our fee income during the second quarter. As of July 27, we have collected 98.1% of rent billed for July. This is a 170 basis points better than April, May and June results at the same day of the month. Adding the 0.3% of deferred payments for COVID-19 affected resident payment plans, referenced in the COVID-19 disclosure, we have accounted for 98.4% of July's billed rent. This is an encouraging result, but we are keeping a close eye on the CARES Act expiration and the discussion around the continuation of government benefits. Leasing volume for July is on track to exceed last year. Historically, pricing power peaks in the early third quarter and thus far July has been our best pricing month since COVID-19 hit. Net July month-to-date blended lease-over-lease rates signed during the month increased 1.7%. This is more than 100 basis points better than leases signed in the second quarter. While we see this improvement across asset types and locations, our B assets and our suburban locations are stronger. In addition to positive pricing trends, occupancy has also strengthened. Occupancy has improved from a low point of 95.1% to 95.7% today. Sixty day exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, has dropped from a high of 9.2% in April to 8.4% in June and is now 8%. Our current residents are choosing to stay with us and our resident renewal retention rates were also positive. August, September and October renewal accept rates are running ahead of prior years and signed lease-over-lease rates are in the 4% to 5% range. I would like to echo Eric's comments and thank our teams as well. They have served and cared for our residents and our associates well and have grappled with the constantly changing implications of COVID-19. They worked diligently to provide supportive and caring environments for our residents and one another. I am proud of them and grateful for their efforts and character. I will now turn the call over to Brad.
Brad Hill: Thank you Tom. The transaction market continues to experience a material slowdown in activity, with second quarter volume within our markets down significantly from 2019. In addition to challenges in underwriting, travel moratoriums, property tour restrictions and difficulties performing due diligence, all continue to make closing a successful transaction challenging. Despite these pressures, sellers are beginning to test the waters and our number of underwritings, while still below previous years, have increased materially since the beginning of July. Certainty of execution is more important than ever and since this is one of our core strengths, we have been able to review a number of properties, mostly off market. At this point, most of the deals we have reviewed have not traded, so broad pricing trends are not yet apparent. The upcoming election is likely to further suppress transaction volume and cause the lack of pricing discovery to persist. We believe better buying opportunities on new lease-ups should emerge after the election and into 2021 as the backlog of merchant built properties, which are prevalent in our footprint, begin to hit the market. The availability of financing continues to evolve. While early in the pandemic debt financing was difficult across the board, it now remains difficult for lease-up properties as well as some developments, but it is available at very attractive rates for stabilized assets. In addition, the commitment of equity is also further restricting transaction volume and construction starts. To-date, a number of equity providers have paused or completely pulled out of quite a few new developments as well as acquisitions, sometimes for reasons not related to the real estate or the returns. This hesitancy coupled with our continued ability to perform on compelling investments has opened the door for us to review numerous opportunities through each of our external growth platforms. While we are reviewing a few acquisitions, it's still too early for new lease-up opportunities to materialize and more compelling investments on existing assets are likely to emerge late this year and into 2021. Our balance sheet is well-positioned to allow us to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise. Our development team continues to pursue a number of land sites with three developments in due diligence that we hope to start construction on in 2021. With equity hesitating on new developments, we are receiving strong interest in our pre-purchase platform. We are currently in conversations on several opportunities that would likely start construction late this year or early next, with delivery occurring mid-2022 and wrapping up in 2023. These development and pre-purchase investments align well with the current delivery pipelines and will deliver at a time when we believe the leasing conditions for new developments will be significantly stronger. We are beginning to see a drop in permit activity and have seen a substantial drop in construction starts in our markets, which should result in a decrease in deliveries in 2022 and 2023. In terms of construction, the six projects we have under way remain on budget and on schedule. And to-date, we have not experienced any major disruptions or delays to any of our supply chains. With that, I will turn the call over to Al.
Al Campbell: Thank you Brad and good morning everyone. I will provide some brief commentary on the company's recent earnings performance, balance sheet position and then finally, a few comments on our outlook for the remainder of 2020. As mentioned earlier, we are very encouraged by the second quarter performance, particularly in the area of rent collections. At beginning of the pandemic, this area was the most significant short term unknown with rental pricing expected to have a longer term impact as new leases rolled through the portfolio. As noted in the supplement, through July 27, we either fully collected or obtained deferral agreements for 98.4% of all rent billed during the second quarter. And at this point, we have had very good payment performance from our deferral addendums with a 97% compliance rate on outstanding agreements. We also established a reserve sufficient to cover all rent unpaid from residents not entering a formal agreement as well as a large portion of the deferred rent. July continued the strong trend in rent collections, but given the remaining high level of uncertainty, we do not yet have enough clarity to reestablish earnings for overall same-store guidance for the year. However, we do have a little more clarity on operating expenses and overall, we still expect them to end up essentially in line with our initial forecast for the year. As a reminder, we initially outlined same-store expense growth for the full year to be in the range of 3.75% to 4.75% growth or 4.25% growth at the midpoint. The primary pressure is coming from real estate taxes, insurance and the roll out of the bulk Internet cable program called Double Play. The context and the contribution to expense growth, ignoring these three items, all other operating expenses are expected to grow about 2.5% for the full year. Our balance sheet continues to support our business plans very well with leverage near historic lows and significant capacity from cash and remaining borrow potential under our line of credit combining for $927 million of capacity. We restarted our redevelopment programs during the quarter and our development pipeline continues to progress well and on track. We expect to fund between $200 million and $250 million balance for the full year toward the completion of our development pipeline. As Brad mentioned, the acquisition environment remains challenging with most opportunities expected to be pre-purchase deals, which will have longer term funding commitments similar to a development. We currently expect our business plans for the remainder of the year to be essentially leverage neutral not requiring any equity funding this year. However, as previously discussed, our plans do include a potential bond deal in the second half of the year to fully pay off our line of credit, maintaining our capacity and prepaying some future debt maturities in today's low rate environment. And finally, as reflected in our release, we incurred $2.4 million of COVID-19 related expenses during the second quarter, primarily consisting of additional cleaning supplies, COVID-19 related leave and contract labor. We added these costs back to core FFO as these initial expenses are considered non-recurring in nature. We do expect remaining costs to be much smaller over the second half of the year. That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Ashley, we will now turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Neil Malkin with Capital One. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Hi everyone. Good morning.
Eric Bolton: Hi Neil. Good morning Neil.
Neil Malkin: Nice quarter. First question. Have you started to see, maybe over the last three months in terms of your new leases, migration out of the gateway urban markets and into your sort of core Sunbelt names? Or is that kind of either too hard or too soon to discern?
Eric Bolton: No. We track that information. Overall, it's a relatively low percentage of our total leases. We didn't see much movement in the second quarter. But in July that began to tick up. So New York is up double-digits, Massachusetts up about 8.7% and Pennsylvania up about 5.3% of our increase over prior year on that. But again, still relatively low percentage of our total leases, but we are beginning to see early trends in that.
Neil Malkin: Okay. And then just as a follow-up to that. Are you seeing, within your markets, more move from urban to suburban particularly in some of your, I guess, maybe out of your post assets or things like that into more suburban areas?
Eric Bolton: We are not seeing that. We are seeing demand for urban assets. Suburban assets is a stronger pricing for us right now. But we are not seeing people transfer from urban to suburban.
Neil Malkin: Got it. And then maybe can you just talk about Orlando? How that market has been performing and how it's trending? Similar with Charleston and Savannah and in some of your markets that are more exposed to leisure travel?
Eric Bolton: Yes. Orlando is, I would say, improved on the rent collection standpoint. They were one of our larger exposures back in April. They are now just 0.7% of leases outstanding or on renewal or on rent support programs. In terms of the market, Disney and Universal coming back in modest fashion have helped a little bit. We are seeing the more Northern properties perform better than the Southern properties, which have that exposure to Disney and a little bit of International. So it's sort of, I would say, largely the same with some improving rent collection trends right now. But we are pleased to see the parks open and that has a ripple effect across those Southern properties. And then Charleston frankly improved significantly. We saw a nice pickup in late second quarter and early July. I mean Savannah is still worry bead on that front.
Neil Malkin: Great. And then last one from me. In terms of opportunities, you mentioned, you kind of talked about a lot, I am not sure I got all of it correctly. But you do not think that in the second half of the year, you are going to see stabilized opportunities. It's mostly just the development related deals. And then also, are you thinking or what do you think about doing some mezz or preferred given the kind of dislocation relative to earlier in the year and the higher yields you could get?
Brad Hill: Neil, this is Brad. I think in terms of the opportunities for the rest of the year, I do think there will be, we have seen starting in July some stabilized assets have begin to come to market. Certainly in the second quarter, there was just a complete fall off and transactions coming to market. That's picked up a bit. I think for us, our focus has always been on new lease-ups. And to-date we are not really seeing those come to market. I think there needs to be a little bit more pressure in the market before developers begin to really bring those to market. So we are really focused in seeing opportunities right now based on kind of the capital constraints that I mentioned in my opening comments. We are seeing the opportunities really emerge on the development front, land sites that have been dropped and then also on pre-purchase where we partner with developers. And for those, we have got difficulties in both debt and equity on that side that's putting some opportunities in front of us that we wouldn't have had.
Eric Bolton: Neil, this is Eric. Also just to clarify, we are not in the business of financing other people's properties. We will come in with capital and work with developers on the basis that we will ultimately own the asset. But functioning strictly as a financier of other people's product is not what we do.
Neil Malkin: Got it. Thank you guys very much.
Tom Grimes: Thanks Neil.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Sumit Sharma: Hi guys. This is Sumit, in for Nick. Good thoughts about renewals. Just trying to understand how you guys are thinking about this. They were lower in July, but still well above peers at 4.8%. And just to make sure these leases were offered about 30 to 60 days earlier, right. So most likely right after reopening, how should we think about renewals looking ahead? I mean, is this close to the low in July? Or could they track new lease rates and perhaps stay flattish or slip a little further? Any color around that? Or what is your most sticky point in your negotiations with renewing tenants? And what's driving turnover so low would be really helpful?
Al Campbell: Thank you. I think you caught it in your earlier comments. July was priced on the renewal front at the sort of peak concern level at this point or thus far. So we would expect at this point the renewal rates for July, that took place in July, to be the low point renewals. And in July we are 4.5%. And I think we expect September and October to be between 4% and 5% range going forward. So a little recovery in renewal rates is what we are expecting.
Sumit Sharma: And I guess, just following up, what's driving negotiations and turnover? Just any color on that kind of thing?
Eric Bolton: We have got a very sophisticated platform and team that works to understand what the market demand is for renewal. And we use that process consistently and have trusted it over the years. And that's what we used to move out. And then, we obviously have some level of negotiation with the resident at that point. There hadn't been much in the way of sticking points. So we sort of feel like we are hitting the right spot in terms of the market, because the accept rates are actually better than in prior years. So I would say, it's a pretty honestly normal renewal process going forward.
Sumit Sharma: Okay. That's really helpful color. And I guess what's, just to understand the overall pricing environment a little better and I will yield after that, we are hearing that there was a surge of pent-up demand right after the lockdowns. And so there were people who really wanted to sort of change living conditions and that's why they were looking to move even during the virtual leasing days. But now that everything is seemingly open again, we are also hearing that we are seeing a lot more bargain hunters implying rate pressure and competitive dynamics. So your views seem to suggest that you are not seeing that. I guess what's different here? Or what's driving your optimism a little more?
Eric Bolton: What I would tell you is that we did see, as you saw in my comments around the second quarter, we did see sort of a push back in leasing volumes in May and June which sort of caught us up from the fall off in April. But what we are seeing is sort of a normal seasonal trend at this point. And sort of pricing power, if you will, normally peaks in late July and early August. I would expect that to happen. And then of course, it will fall off in the fall under normal seasonal patterns. We are certainly seeing bargain hunters out there and our pricing is down lower than it was at this time last year. But what we are seeing is sort of normal seasonal pricing patterns now as we move past that sort of shutdown, if you will, that occurred in late March and early April.
Tom Grimes: The other thing I would add is that, I think the fact that you are seeing performance along the lines of what you are describing, you really have to start thinking about different parts of the country. And our Sunbelt markets have just continued to, we think, demonstrate a certain resiliency to them that is stronger than what we are seeing in other regions of the country. And as a consequence of that, things were depressed from where they were a year ago, but patterns and overall behavior in activity surrounding leasing and renewal is pretty much in line with patterns that we have seen historically.
Sumit Sharma: Thank you so much. That's really great color. I will yield now.
Tom Grimes: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. With COVID cases increasing kind of broadly across the Sunbelt, I am wondering on the ground if you see any correlation between local hotspots and the relative strength of the operating environment?
Brad Hill: Nick, you were a little muffled. And we are all trying to talk through masks, I suspect. But I think you were asking correlation between hotspots and leasing volume. Is that correct?
Nick Joseph: That's right. Just on kind of the micro level, if you see a hotspot or if there is a hotspot for COVID, do you feel that on the ground, from a leasing perspective?
Tom Grimes: Nick, we have not seen much in the way of correlation on that. You know, the market fundamentals really seem to be driven more by where the layoffs are occurring and then some variability between location and the submarket. But we are not seeing leasing fall-off in, let's say, high positivity markets versus low positivity markets at this point, unless those correlate with unemployment levels.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just on that, do you have a sense of what percentage of your tenants are currently unemployed or benefiting from government support?
Tom Grimes: We do not have insight into their source of income, Nick. But the fact that we have seen such an improvement and in terms of the number of people asking support from us and the feedback that we get, when we interact with our assistant property managers and our property managers, which as you can imagine, we are doing a ton of right now is that the people getting off are not getting off the plans because their government check came in. They are getting off the plans because they got more hours or they got pulled back off of furlough or Disney opened and they are now engaged in some sort of support capacity.
Eric Bolton: And Nick, the other thing I would add is, when you look at the average income of our portfolio of our resident profile and our average rent at this point, rent constitutes about 20% of monthly income of our resident base, pretty affordable. And so as a consequence of that, while we are certainly monitoring what's happening with the efforts to continue some government assistance at the federal level for unemployment, we are not particularly concerned about that issue, because we just haven't, for all the reasons that Tom mentioned, we just feel like that our folks have not really depended a lot on that assistance to meet the rent obligations.
Nick Joseph: Thank you. That's very helpful.
Tom Grimes: Thank you Nick.
Operator: We will take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks and good morning everyone. Eric or Tom, I am curious what you think is really driving the strong demand for your properties today, given the state of the job market, the fact that there is some strength in the single-family housing market, both for buy and rentals. And so do you think it's renters that are trading down and bargain hunting, as somebody referenced earlier? Just curious about your thoughts on what's driving demand today?
Tom Grimes: Yes. Austin, I appreciate the question. I think it really is the underlying outlay of our markets in our area of the country and what we are seeing is normal patterns. And I mean I appreciate the comment on strong demand. I am not sure I would quite classify that other than strong relative demand. But demand is clearly off of the levels that we were seeing last year. But I mean we like the resiliency that we are seeing. We are spread out across the Sunbelt, which is a place that is I think appealing, especially in this timeframe and was already a major driver for jobs. And then we have allocated across, we have got across different market types as well. So it is holding up well and the defensive nature of our portfolio I think is showing, but I would hold short before I called it strong demand, I would call relatively strong demand, which we are pleased with.
Eric Bolton: I would also add, Austin, when you consider the fact that 80% of our resident profile is single and only 20% married and over 50% female, this is not a demographic, this is going to be driven to move into single-family, be it for sale or for rent. So we just continue to not see any mounting evidence whatsoever that single-family is becoming more compelling as it pertains to drawing more of our traffic.
Tom Grimes: Yes. I probably should have mentioned as well. Move-outs to buy a house during the quarter were down almost 5% and home renting was down significantly and still less than 6% or it was down almost 10%, it's less than 6% of our move-outs. So we hear the builders are busier, but we are not seeing any impact of that here.
Austin Wurschmidt: Understood. All fair points and appreciate the detail. Eric, you have previously talked about the dry powder you have in the balance sheet and you are willing to use it for the right opportunity. I am curious with the decrease in permitting levels and new supply that you referenced in your prepared remarks, when would you or would you consider ramping the development pipeline above kind of those previous ranges that you have targeted? And then also wondering if you could put a finer point on what the decrease in supply into 2021 looks like?
Eric Bolton: Well, I will take the first part and Brad you can take the supply question. Yes, I will tell you, Austin, yes, we definitely are looking for some development sites at the moment. We think that, as Brad alluded to in his comments that if we were able to start some new projects early next year, that delivering in 2022, early 2023 could be really, really strong. And so we have got existing land sites that we own in Austin, another opportunity that we are working on in Raleigh, another opportunity we are working on in Tampa. And so you are not going to see it ramp up significantly because we have also got some other projects we will be finishing up. But on balance, I think that you will likely see our development pipeline move up somewhat over the next year or so, because we think deliveries in the next two years could be quite profitable.
Brad Hill: And Austin, this is Brad. On the supply question for 2021, I think in terms of specific numbers for 2021, it's kind of hard to pinpoint at this point. But I think if you look at the larger picture here, starting in March when COVID kind of started and the impact started hitting, it really permits, it really started to decline and construction starts more. So if you are looking at an 18 month to a 20 month time period for delivery, you are starting to get into the back half of next year, end of next year when the supply starts to go down versus previous expectations. But in terms of the magnitude of that at this point, I think it's too early to say what it is. But we do expect, starting end of next year supply coming down just based on the construction starts in permitting and then that carrying into a larger degree into 2022.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. Eric, I mean how large the development pipeline would you be willing to build, either from a dollar perspective or percent of EV?
Al Campbell: Austin, this is Al. What we have talked about in the past is really, we wouldn't want to go above 5% of our balance sheet. But that's a pretty big number. You are talking $700 million to $800 million right now. As Eric mentioned, we have got about $450 million that we are working on. Some of that will deliver over the next year, year-and-a-half. And we will have several projects come back into the pipeline. So we would expect it to go up from the $450 million that we have right now. But you wouldn't see it go probably $800 million or something like that unless we had a specific plan or something different.
Austin Wurschmidt: Understood. Thanks guys.
Operator: We will take our next question from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Great quarter everybody. I just want to clarify. I think it was Tom, 5,600 seeking assistance in April down to 530 in July. Was that right? And seeking assistance from the government or from you?
Tom Grimes: From us. Those are the people that we reached out to identify and it is assistance from us in term of rent abatement plans.
Eric Bolton: Your numbers are correct, Rich.
Tom Grimes: And yes, your numbers are correct, yes.
Rich Anderson: Okay. So you actually gave assistance or they were seeking assistance?
Tom Grimes: No. We gave assistance. We did it. We had plans that set up payment plans for rent over a defined time.
Rich Anderson: Okay. And I think it was you also, Tom, that mentioned, you are seeing people come from Massachusetts and New York. I find that kind of interesting. I am surprised, you are not more interested in that. You kind of brushed it off as an early sign. Don't we have to crawl before we walk? I kind of feel like that might be something to really keep an eye on. And I am wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on your perspective of that kind of in-migration dynamic you are seeing?
Tom Grimes: No, I mean the dynamic is real and it's part of the reason that we have built our strategy. While we feel like the Sunbelt is a place that’s always benefited from in-migration, it's a high quality of life, it's affordable and you have some flexibility here. And then that has accelerated in latter years as taxes got more difficult and things like that. And then it seems to be further accelerating as work from home allows unprecedented flexibility on where you choose to live and things like density and transit or things that were perceived as real strengths may be less so. So we certainly read everything that you are reading and think that's interesting. And that's a lot of the reason why we are where we are. But right now, the total move-ins from those markets is still relatively low. The pickup is interesting for us and we think this is going to continue. But I don't want to overstate the impact on our demand and that's why I was perhaps being a little lighter on the point earlier.
Rich Anderson: Are people saying, I am coming here because I am afraid of what's going on? And is it impacted by COVID-19? Or is it sort of just a data point you really can't characterize it?
Tom Grimes: It is data point based on where they moved from. We have not conducted interviews. But I will tell you, when I talk to our staff members who are often moving, we have a healthy amount of people from the Northeast in Raleigh and in Charlotte and in Tampa, Chicago and in Phoenix and Denver and Dallas and Austin, it's California. They are moving and they are moving with their family and they are moving because they are out-priced and over-commuted and those are the things driving it. Now, these recent things like COVID and unrest, that may accelerate things further. But the people we have talked to, it's been lifestyle choices based on quality of life. We have not heard anybody recent enough or had a conversation recent enough to know that these other things are playing into it at this point.
Rich Anderson: Okay. Great. So know in migration, the fact of life in the Sunbelt generally, I just didn't know if it was significantly more than typical. But anyway I will move on. Last question from me, may be to Eric. If you get your federal support and that situation gets resolved, tariffs too, what do you think you and perhaps the industry, because I assume you talked to every other REIT about how to position earning season? Do you think guidance could come back into the mix next quarter or some time or do you think we are going to probably wait this out till 2021 comes around?
Eric Bolton: No. I think that if we see stabilization broadly begin to take place and the government programs get recommitted to, I think by the time we get to the end of October, when we are releasing Q3, we will have pretty good visibility on the balance of the year at that point. So my guess is that when we release Q3, we will have a pretty good read on the full year to that point. And then we are also starting to get some sense of where 2021 is likely to go a little bit as well. We probably will not give guidance for 2021 at the end of October. But I think we will have some evidence to at least guide expectations a bit, supply dynamics, things of that nature, probably, are pretty well known. So I am confident by the time we get to the end of October, we will have a pretty good read on the balance of the year.
Rich Anderson: Okay. That sounds great. Thanks everybody.
Eric Bolton: You bet.
Al Campbell: Thanks Rich.
Operator: And we will now take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Yes. That's fine, Mizuho, thank you. I promise I only have two questions. So first one here is, you mentioned earlier that you have been able to review a few deals from potential sellers. I am curious what, looking at some of these shadow deals, I know they haven't closed, I am curious what they inform you on seller underwriting, maybe from a cap rate IRR perspective?
Tom Grimes: Haendel, could you say that one more time. I am sorry we had a hard time hearing you on that.
Eric Bolton: It was muffled a little bit, Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste: Sure thing. I was referring to the comments you made earlier about being able to review a few deals from potential sellers. So I was curious what looking at some of these shadow deals, I know they didn't close, but I am curious what you might have learned? What reviewing the deals informed you of the seller expectations and what they are underwriting maybe from a cap rate or IRR perspective? Thanks.
Brad Hill: Yes. Haendel, this is Brad. I will answer the first part of that. And anybody else can add in. But certainly, if you look back at second quarter, as I mentioned, volume was off tremendously. Normally in a quarter we are underwriting somewhere between 50 and 60 deals and in the second quarter we looked at 10 individual assets. So that just gives you an indication of the potential for data points is very, very limited and it's hard to draw strong conclusions from that. Of the 10 that we looked at, three have closed. Those were generally stabilized assets. Certainly, as I mentioned, the lease-up properties are not coming to market. So we really don't have any data points for pricing to indicate any pricing on those. But then as you get into the stabilized assets, you really have two camps. You have just a stabilized asset or you have a value-add. And the value-add camp is certainly seeing more of an impact. We are in constant communications with other contacts within the industry to try to help paint a broader picture of what this pricing environment looks like. And again, we just don't have a lot of data points. But I can tell you what we are generally seeing is, if you just look at the underwriting impact of what generally folks believe the impact to underwriting is of COVID going forward over the next couple of years is generally a 5% to 10% pricing discount is what folks expect. If you look at the deals that have closed, again taking out lease-ups, which haven't occurred and then taking out value-add, you are really looking at pricing discounts between 0% and 5%. And really what's helping folks bridge that gap is buyers are able to really pay a little bit more for the assets than what the underwriting would suggest because of the accommodative financing of our environment that's out there. And these high levered folks that are able to close on these transactions are able to kind of push through that pricing a little bit. But what it has indicated to us, because the fundamentals are off and the pricing is not off as much as that would suggest is the cap rates are coming down. We have seen that again on the couple of deals that we have looked at and then we are also hearing that with the industry contacts that we are talking to. But I would just say that it's very limited number of data points at this point. So it's really hard to draw strong conclusions from that at this point. And I think we will start to see some of the stabilized asset pricing point trickle out as we get a little bit further along in the year. But lease-up pricing, I think, will be next year before we start seeing that.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. That's helpful. And it largely fits with what we have heard as well. One last one. I was curious if you could talk about the blended rent growth in 2Q and July between your leading growth markets, the Austins, the Raleighs and your weaker ones, Atlanta. And maybe perhaps you could give us some thoughts on your near term expectations. Do you expect that relationship in terms of blended rent growth between the best and the worst to get wider or to narrow over the next couple of quarters? And why?
Tom Grimes: You are going to see, Haendel, I think we are seeing better progress for signed in July in Phoenix, Raleigh, Jacksonville, Greenville, places like that. Houston and Orlando flat to modestly improving. And then Savannah, as I mentioned earlier, in Charleston both improved on blended pricing during the quarter. Charleston improved a good bit, Savannah modestly. Overall, again I think we will follow on new lease pricing. I think we will follow seasonal patterns. What it gives me some encouragement is across the board in July, move-ins increased, exposure has come down and occupancy has improved during the month. And I think that sets us up well to follow sort of our typical seasonal pattern on those areas.
Haendel St. Juste: If I could follow-up and violate what I promised I wouldn't do. Any cover on concessions? It would seem that the best and the worst markets generally, what the market or what you are seeing across some of those better markets and weaker markets is?
Tom Grimes: Yes. So we are on a net effective basis on concession. So we give a few, really where we are set up near lease-ups for the company. Concessions were 0.8% of net potential last year and are 1% this year. Our competitors, what we are seeing and as most competitive markets is in places like in Downtown Atlanta inner loop and Buckhead, one to two months free on stabilized assets, up to three on lease-up properties. In Houston inner loop, we are seeing half month to a month. Phoenix, much lighter in areas like that. And Orlando is a little softer to the south, as I mentioned, than to the north just to go around the horn. The worst concession developer thing that we have seen is four months free at a busted deal that Brad's already sniffed around on in Fredericksburg, Virginia and the DC suburbs.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you for the color. I appreciate it.
Operator: We will take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning guys. Can you talk about what you guys typically see in terms of traffic and leasing volume in May, June, July from the influx of new college graduates in your core markets in a normal year and what you have seen thus far this year?
Tom Grimes: Obviously it's reflected in our overall results. Our overall exposure around the student housing is low. We don't have any property that's remotely close to half of its students. But we have seen, we have got one asset in Atlanta near Emory and it's been a little slower. But honest in terms of students coming back and we have got a few others like that, we are just using that as an opportunity to diversify what our unit mix is. So we are definitely seeing some delay on people committing to housing. It was much later. And then it's hit or miss where it is depending on what the school signaled early. And then as I suspect, it continues to evolve as schools are changing their plans. The short answer is, we have got so little exposure to it that we don't pay a ton of attention to it, but it picked up a few snippets here or there.
Rob Stevenson: No. What I was focusing on is, somebody who just graduated from, let's say, Georgia Tech and is now going to rent a unit in Atlanta with one of his buddies because last year he would have been working for a consulting firm or a tech firm or something like that. The new leases from somebody that doesn't have a background where it's the graduates whatever they are, how big a meaningful portion are college graduates in that sort of May, June, July at the beginning of the summer leasing season? And the influx of that typically in terms of your business? And what is that sort of dropped off to now? Is it half? Is it a quarter? Are all these kids staying in their parents' basements and working remotely? Or in the Sunbelt markets, have the businesses actually brought the new hires into the headquarters buildings, et cetera?
Eric Bolton: Yes. I will answer it anecdotally. And that is, we saw leasing in May and June strong enough that it offset the weakness in April and put us ahead for the quarter in aggregate and July is running ahead of last year. So our overall demand in terms of the number of leases that we have been able to execute has been a little bit better than last year. We also have not seen, often we will see either shopped or we will pick up a few where a large hire will BofA or somebody like that is bringing on a bunch of new people and they are looking for 40 units in a market and they all want to be near Peachtree Road or something like that. We are not seeing those. We are not seeing those shops. But as far as exactly what the number is of people, college grads that are looking at or not looking at, I don't have that. But we have been able to fill units as we normally would.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then, you guys talked earlier about the development starts over the next six, nine months, expected to be delivered in 2022. At what point do some of the sort of issues with COVID start to make its way and how you plan and build new development projects? I mean if I look over the last 10 years across the apartment space, units have gotten smaller. There has been more studios in the mix. You have had more central entrances and elevator banks as you have gone from three storey walk-ups to a mid-rise, et cetera. So whether or not it's urban or suburban, people have been packed in tighter. When you guys think about planning out the new developments that you will start next year, are you making any changes to the size of the units, to the unit mixes, how tenants enter, exit the building? And if you are, what is that doing to construction cost estimates when you plan this versus what you would have started a year or so ago?
Brad Hill: Yes. Rob, this is Brad. I don't think we have made any broad changes to unit sizes or things like that. I mean I think over the last couple of years, we have been doing more dens. And one of the things we are adding is the opportunity within the club houses for a work from home type environment. We are trying to add desks and things like that, areas within some of our new units wherever we can. But I feel like there's been, at least for us over the last couple of years, there has been a push to really beefing up the amenities on the outside from the pool decks to having some congregation areas that are on the outside of the units, exterior. And I think that will continue. And we are pouring even the deals we are looking at now, quite a bit into the design and the development of those outside gathering spaces as folks look to get outside when they can. So those are the things that we are looking at. I am not sure that we have seen any type of construction cost considerations or any trends relative to those things at this point.
Eric Bolton: And Rob, I will tell you, this is Eric. We are, of all the projects that we are looking at and all that we have under way right now, only one is in an urban core area in Downtown, Orlando. Everything else that we are doing is suburban. Usually two, three story, walk up, in some cases elevators. But we have only got one project we are working on that is, what I call, real high density type project.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. What is your average square foot per unit these days?
Tom Grimes: Well, Rob, I would say, it's roughly 900 square feet, 950 square feet.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.
Operator: We will go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. I think Eric or Brad mentioned that the upcoming election has had an adverse impact on transaction volumes. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on that? And whether that's specific to the uncertainty of 1031 exchanges?
Brad Hill: This is Brad, John. I don't think it is relative to 1031 exchanges at this point. I think it's just another item that introduces uncertainty into the transaction market. I do think we have seen an uptick in opportunities come to market. The first part of July has been pretty robust. And generally everything that's coming out right now is off market. It's not fully marketed deals. So I am sure there are things that are coming out that we are not even seeing at the moment. But there is an uptick in that and I suspect that will continue for the next month or two and then likely dissipate as we get closer to the election. From the folks we are talking to, it's just another area of uncertainty into the valuation model that just puts folks on pause. So I don't think it's anything specific to trying to project who is elected or what policy and the impact of that policy at this point. I think it's just another unknown.
John Kim: Without getting too political, I mean, is your view or the markets view that the Biden presidency would be negative for asset values?
Eric Bolton: I don't know, John. I think that I am not going to go there. I don't know how the market is, at this point, weighing, whether a Trump or Biden presidency is favorable or unfavorable. I think that what we are seeing is really just what Brad alluded to is just, there is just uncertainty and I think capital just gets a little bit nervous with uncertainty and it makes it harder to underwrite. So I think that's all we are seeing at this point.
John Kim: Fair enough. Tom mentioned, in your prepared remarks, that the return of guided tours to complement your virtual and self guided tours. Did you find in the force experiments that the traditional tours or at least a hybrid approach are more effective?
Tom Grimes: No, we did not. What we found that it was thrilling to really know if they were equally as effective. And so we are very pleased with that. Those tours got us over the hump and now it's roughly 43% of our resident, of our leads, our tours are doing guided tours where they are interacting with our folks. And it's split evenly between virtual and self tours after that. We have learned an awful lot about the process. Thrilled with how the teams have worked and adapted them. And then as we get into 2021, you will see us begin to do some things that really streamline and ease the self-service side of it. But we were quite pleased with how effective they were with the residents and what the prospects and how well our teams adapted to that really overnight and used those well.
John Kim: Can you provide an update as to what percentage of your communities have the capability to do self guided tours?
Tom Grimes: 100%. We have self guided tours occurring at every property in the company.
John Kim: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Tom Grimes: You bet.
Operator: And we will take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks very much. Just two questions from me. Tom, on the new lease figures for sign in July, could you give us a sense if you excluded interior redevelopments what that new lease figure might look like? I am just trying to get a sense for what market rent growth is across your portfolio right now?
Tom Grimes: John, it would really be minimal. I would have to go back it out, but since we didn't produce any in second quarter, it is really minimal that at least we just got back to turning those on. So this is probably as clean a result on renovate impact as you are going to see.
John Pawlowski: All right. Perfect. And then Brad, curious with your question or with your conversations with developers, do you get the sense, I know it's tough to read the tea leaves, but do you get the sense that they think this is a two or three month pause on their debt and equity providers given the money? Or they have become really concerned that this is kind of more of a structural multi-quarter, multi-year kind of freeze in their capital sources?
Brad Hill: Well, I think, first of all, the development bunch is normally a very opportunistic and a very positive group. So I don't think they view this as a structural issue. I do think that they see it as problematic, because a lot of the folks that we talk to are merchant developers and their platform is certainly built on the machine continuing to run. So I think that they are out looking for alternative sources, whether this is short term or long term. But that bunch is normally, they are having glass half full normally. So I don't know that they are and I have no indications at this point that they are thinking that this is a long term shift and that they are changing their strategies because of that. But there is certainly an impact. I think the debt side of things for developers that are not this strong established sponsors with strong relationships with the banking community, those folks are going to have a hard time lining up debt for the foreseeable future.
John Pawlowski: All right. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Alex Kalmus: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Looking at your collection results which are clearly trending above the group, I was hoping you could walk us through the components on Page 30? Is this total build in the denominator? Is that off of the original rent? Or is that off of the newly amended lease rates? And same question for July, that 98.4%. Thank you.
Al Campbell: Yes. Alex, this is Al. That is based on for April, May and June what was billed, that cash they are expected to pay. I mean that is what the lease would say and before any addendum, the lease would say what was signed to be and then after addendum, they would have that lease rate plus additional amount that we spread over the life of the lease. So that cash bill number is what we billed and expect them to collect in total. And the point there in that presentation was to say that, look, we have collected 98.9% in cash, another 50 basis points or 0.5% in payment addendums that we are getting very good collection performance on. I think at this point, it's about 97% compliance with that. So we feel very good about that. But having said that, we felt it was prudent to put a reserve on the books that was sufficient to cover a couple of things. One, if somebody did not come in and talk to us at all and do an addendum, fully reserve that. And if someone did do an addendum, we reserved a substantial portion of that. Somewhere, they are different for each one, but on aggregate probably two-thirds of that. So that's what that represents, the expected cash collections and where we are on that and what we reserved.
Alex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you. And a slightly different topic. In terms of occupancy and how you are thinking about the fall season coming up, historically you have been seeing great renewal growth rates. I am curious if you would like to see your occupancy number go up before maybe uncertainty in the fall? Or are you still going to be pushing those renewals? Thank you.
Tom Grimes: I will tell you that we expect occupancy to build with exposure going down, expect that to happen and bring our exposure down and prepare ourselves for the low demand timeframe. Those renewal rates, if you look at us historically in the fall, they are lower than they are in the peak season. But I would expect them to continue on at about this rate, which is still a significant lower increase than this time last year. So I would expect recovery in our renewal rates and the variable that will change to manage exposure down and occupancy up will be probably a seasonal fall off, I would expect in our new lease rates as we move into the fall.
Alex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much.
Tom Grimes: You bet.
Operator: And we will go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hi. Good morning guys. Would you happen to have a snapshot of the gain or loss to lease of the portfolio as it stands today?
Tom Grimes: What earned in the is today?
Wes Golladay: Yes.
Brad Hill: You know Wes, we don't have that in front of me. I will see if we could get back to you on that.
Eric Bolton: We can get that to you. We will get back to you on that, Wes.
Brad Hill: Yes. We certainly had a strong loss lease going into the second quarter. I think it's probably declined, given that leasing trends that we have seen in the quarter certainly come down. But the important point is that the actions that we took over the last year is really to continue to push price and give a little occupancy to do that, put us in a really good position going into the second quarter. So it protected us well there. It has come down. Tim can get that. And we will get that back to you offline. What we think it is, yes.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And the qualitative was good, I was kind of getting with the strong renewal to see if it's going to taper off a bit. Now turning to acquisitions, you kind of mentioned looking at lease-up properties. Would you expect a lot of off market transactions limited bid. And then secondly, would you expect competition from the levered buyers?
Brad Hill: This is Brad. Wes, I would say, predominantly what we are seeing right now is off market. There's only been a couple, maybe 10% of what we have seen come across has been fully marketed deals. So yes, I think everything right now is going to be more off-market. Even the deals that have been marketed, some of those were pre-empted or somebody came in and just paid what the seller wanted and really short circuited the marketing process. So I expect that to continue. And then I am sorry, what was the second part of your question.
Wes Golladay: So would you expect the levered buyers to be active competition for you?
Brad Hill: Well, not on lease-ups, I don't. We generally don't see those come into play as much on lease-ups. Those are generally focused on the assets that are currently earning, so stabilized assets, that's where you see those a little bit more. Also on lease-ups where we are focused, financing is extremely difficult right now. And that's why a lot of the sellers are not wanting to bring those to market at the moment. They are wanting to get stabilized so that they can line up financing and certainly bring those high levered buyers in there. So to the extent that developers can wait it out and get their assets stabilized, then I think the leveraged buyer can come there. But that's really not the segment of the lease-up segment that we are actually focused on.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.
Tom Grimes: Wes, thank you.
Operator: And it appears that there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the company for any final comments.
Eric Bolton: Okay. We really appreciate everyone joining our call this morning. And if you have any follow-up questions, just reach out and I will be glad to answer any other questions. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude your program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-10 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, May 7, 2020.I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. Please go ahead.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Brad Hill, EVP and Head of Transactions.Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that, as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections.We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statement section in yesterday’s earnings release and our ‘34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call will be available on our website.During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com.I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and thanks to all of you on the call this morning for joining us. I know it’s a busy day of earnings reports. So we’ll keep our comments brief and get to your questions. I’d like to start by offering my appreciation and thanks to the hard-working associates at MAA.I especially want to thank our associates serving at our properties and working directly with our residents. Your dedication and commitment to supporting and serving our residents has been on full display over the past few weeks and has never been more important than it is today. I’m proud of work you’re doing and the service that you’re providing.As noted in our earnings release, first quarter results were better than expected with solid rent growth and strong same-store performance. Our comments this morning, however, will focus on April performance and early May trends. We’re encouraged by the solid performance in rent collection for April as well as the early trends in May.We’ve taken a proactive approach to directly assist and support those residents who are financially impacted by the shutdown of the economy, while also working to ensure that all other residents in various aspects of our operations are performing and functioning as expected. Given the severe pullback in the economy and the associated job losses, leasing conditions deteriorated beginning in late March.This is particularly evident in our leasing trends as it applies to new move-in residents. On the other hand, we’re seeing positive trends associated with our existing residents electing to stay put and resident turnover continues to decline. Overall, we would expect these leasing conditions to persist over the next 2 to 3 months.As you know, the reopening of local economies and businesses across our Sunbelt markets is now underway. Given the range of protocols being used by various states and cities to reopen their economies, it will be a choppy process. However, with unemployment claims across the majority of our states currently running below national averages, coupled with the active efforts underway to reopen across the Sunbelt, we’re hopeful that leasing conditions will start to improve later this year.As efforts to reopen Sunbelt economies are just now getting underway, it’s difficult at the moment to gauge the pace at which employment conditions will improve. We hope to gain better visibility on the important underlying economic and employment market conditions during the second quarter and be in a more informed position as to the outlook for the remainder of the year when we report second quarter results.In the meantime, we’re confident that our strategy focused on the appealing Sunbelt markets, supported by our strong operating platform and our strong balance sheet, executed by a cycle-tested and proven team of associates, will enable MAA to continue to successfully navigate this down-cycle.That’s all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I’ll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I’ll offer a short recap on the first quarter and then move to trends that we have seen in April and May. First quarter of 2020 exceeded our expectations, and the results for the quarter put us in a strong position entering this disruptive COVID-19 period.Effective rents were up 4.2% and blended lease-over-lease pricing, including concessions, was up 2.6%, which was in line with seasonal expectations. Occupancy remained strong at 95.7%. Before shelter-in-place began in mid-March, occupancy was 95.9%, and our 60-day exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, was just 7.6%. This was 40 basis points better than last year.In short, we headed into the COVID-19 disruption with strong occupancy, low 60-day exposure and good embedded rent growth. During the quarter, we completed 1,440 interior redevelopment units and upgraded 8,017 units with our SmartHome technology package. We felt it was prudent to pause both of these programs in March. We’ll monitor demand for these 2 programs and return to production when appropriate.Moving on to April and May trends. Historically, April is a month of accelerating pricing growth as we move into the higher demand season of the year. As you will note from our lease-over-lease pricing, which includes concessions information listed in the supplemental data, you’ll notice this year did not follow that trend.New lease, leasing volume dropped 43% lower than prior year in the last week of March. However, the last 3 weeks, leasing volume has rebounded and is 6% higher than prior year levels. Our teams have been effective at using our virtual and self-tour platform. We expect these practices to be further augmented by guided tours in May.As expected, our current residents are choosing to stay with us, and our resident retention plans are positive. Turnover for the month of April was down 8% versus April of last year. May, June and July renewal acceptance rates are all running ahead of last year at this time.We have worked diligently to identify and support those who need help as a result of COVID-19. 1.3% of our April billed rent is on a 60-day plan to pay, it was established to aid those who are impacted by COVID-19. In addition to flexible payment plans for those affected by COVID-19, we have not charged late fees, frozen eviction proceedings and actively work to pair affected residents with local and national support resources. These changes will cause our late fee income to be lower than expected in the second quarter.Collections have been a focus. In April, we have collected 98% of rent billed for April. When you add the 1.3% of COVID-19 resident – affected resident payment plans that were mentioned earlier, we’ve accounted for 99.3% of April’s billed rent. This is in line with prior year results.May rent payment trends are slightly ahead of April’s patterns. As of May 5, we have collected or executed payment plans for 94.2% of our May billed rent as compared to 92.6% of cash collections and executed payment plans at the same point in April.I’d like to echo Eric’s comments and thank our teams as well. They’ve served and cared for our residents and associates well as we’ve grappled with the constantly changing implications of COVID-19. I’m proud of them and grateful for their efforts and character. Brad?
Bradley Hill: Thank you, Tom. We are certainly in unprecedented times, and the transaction market fully reflects this reality. The transaction market is generally in a wait-and-see mode, and the only transactions occurring are those that were either fully committed before COVID-19 hit with their debt and equity lined up or deals that have a strong buyer need to close, such as the 1031 exchange. Because of this slowdown in activity and in an effort to allow our associates to focus on our properties and our residents, we’ve elected to pause the disposition process of our Jackson, Mississippi properties, and we’ll re-evaluate the sale of those assets at a later date.At this time, we have no insight into any potential cap rate changes due to the lack of activity. Going forward, due diligence processes will be extended, meaning it could be a few months before cap rates and pricing trends are more apparent. We believe the changes taking place due to COVID-19 will potentially lead to more attractive investment opportunities through each of our platforms, land sites for future ground up development, pre-purchase development where we partner with strong developers and acquisition of existing assets. It’s too early to say when the opportunities will begin to materialize, but we continue to work closely with our network of brokers and developers to monitor a number of previously identified opportunities.Since the pandemic hit, new development has shut down with most developers halting all predevelopment spending and many dropping land sites. Construction debt is non-existent, forcing developers to shelf many shovel-ready projects. Due to our balance sheet strength and our available capital through our line of credit, we are receiving more calls from developers looking for capital. As we filter through all opportunities that come our way, we will remain very selective, cautious in our approach and disciplined in our underwriting. With a significant pullback in capital sources for new development, we expect new starts to decline significantly over the next few months, leading to a sharp drop in deliveries within our markets in a couple of years.With regard to the acquisition of existing assets, we continue to monitor the fundamentals in our markets with a significant focus on newly delivered assets that are still in lease-up. This segment of the market is likely to experience the most pressure as rents underperform, concessions increase and stabilization is delayed. Additionally, agencies have pulled back on their funding of non-stabilized assets, limiting the buyer pool for this segment.Finally, just a note on construction, we have been fortunate that all of the municipalities in which we operate have classified construction as an essential business, and we have seen very little impact to the construction schedule of our 7 development projects.With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Al.
Albert Campbell: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. I’ll provide some brief commentary on the company’s recent earnings performance, balance sheet activity, and then finally, a few comments on our outlook for the remainder of 2020. While the main focus of the call this morning is on April performance and May trends, it is important to remember that we did have a strong first quarter performance.Our reported core FFO for the first quarter of $1.62 per share was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. The outperformance was essentially evenly split between favorable operations, primarily revenues and other items below NOI, primarily favorable interest expense for the quarter.Given the significant economic uncertainty related to COVID-19, we formally withdrew our guidance in March and don’t yet have enough clarity to reestablish full year guidance. But to provide as much information about current trends as we could, we added a COVID-19 update section in our supplemental data package, Pages S11 and S12, which has a lot of information about April performance, including collections, leasing, occupancy and other key metrics and some additional very current information about our May collections.And as noted in our release for April and May, we provided flexible payment options and waived late fees for residents financially impacted by the pandemic. Thus far, we’ve been encouraged by April and early May cash collections both for current rent and deferred payments. But as Tom mentioned, we do expect fee performance to reflect more pressure in the near-term as partial resident payments are applied to rent first, and because we waived late fees and certain lease termination fees for impacted residents. You can find details for April fees along with historical context from this in the supplement.As Eric mentioned, our general expectation is for the current leasing conditions to persist over the next few months, continuing to impact revenue performance. However, overall, we expect operating expenses to remain fairly consistent with our original expectations as we expect 2 largest expense areas, personnel and real estate taxes, to remain near early projections for the year with some benefits expected in maintenance costs from lower turnover perhaps offset by slightly higher utilities and marketing expenses. Also below NOI, we expect overhead and interest costs to trend somewhat lower than original expectations for the year as hiring plans and short-term borrowing costs will also be impacted by the current economic environment.Finally, it’s important to point out that many of the activities over the last few years to strengthen our balance sheet position us well in the current challenging environment. Our total leverage remains at a historically low level. We have a significant capacity provided by our $1 billion unsecured credit facility, which is expandable to $1.5 billion. Also, our debt maturities for 2020 are only $137 million.Our remaining development funding obligation for the year is a modest $175 million to $200 million. Although the capital markets have not fully recovered, recent transactions exhibit good access to public bonds and other forms of capital, especially for companies with strong credit metrics such as MAA. We’re positioned to not only weather the current stress well but to eventually pursue opportunities that may result.Though we are committed to our long-term leverage range, given our current metrics, our rating – we expect that we could immediately invest around $750 million in quality properties funded with debt alone. For the appropriate opportunity and plan, additional capacity is likely available as well.That’s all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Keith, we’ll now turn the call over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Want to make sure on the 4% decline that you’re seeing in May, if that’s a good run rate going forward. And also, on the renewal rates, is that something that’s broad brushed or is it specific markets that you’re pushing these renewal rates higher?
Thomas Grimes: John, you were a little blurred on the first question. Was it on the May delinquency; is the run rate what we expect to continue?
John Kim: Just the decline in new rental rates, so that’s if you’d provide any commentary by market and if that’s a good run rate for the remainder of the year.
Thomas Grimes: I wouldn’t say it’s a good run rate for the remainder of the year, but I think April and May are running pretty similar to each other at this point. Really, the run rate for the remainder of the year depends on how rapidly the economy recovers from the COVID-19.
Eric Bolton: And in answer to your second part of your question, the renewal performance, renewal pricing performance is pretty consistent throughout the markets in the portfolio. There’s really no difference there.
John Kim: Right, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Malkin with Capital One. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Hey, guys, good morning. Can you just talk about the collections or the request from residents that had been financially impacted, how that sort of trended across your markets and asset quality and even submarket location?
Thomas Grimes: Yeah, I’ll give you, Neil – this is Tom – just sort of a broad brush. As far as the request came in, they were a little higher in places that are affected by tourism, such as Orlando, Savannah and Charleston. They were as high as $7 million in requests, but $5 million of that has been paid off at this point.On asset quality, we’re not seeing any difference at all. A is paid at 98.1% cash with 1.3% deferred and Bs were 97.9% with 1.3% deferred. So really on an asset class basis, and honestly, if you look at it by suburban-urban or high-rise looking at mid-rise or a garden, those are fairly consistent. The differentiation really comes by market characteristic.
Neil Malkin: No, that’s really helpful. Thanks. I was wondering if – your collections seem to be the highest for any of the apartment REITs that reported last night. I was wondering, do you – what do you attribute that to? I mean I think some people have talked about the Sunbelt maybe not holding up as well as some of the tech-oriented coastal markets, but you seem to be doing, like I said, better than your peers. Kind of what do you attribute that to?
Eric Bolton: Well, Neil, this is Eric. I would tell you that it starts with a principle that we really want to help those people who need help. And I think one of the best ways that you help people that really need help is you also expect that the other aspects of your operation perform as they should and as they’re capable of. And so, what we’ve attempted to do here is to be very proactive at communicating with our residents and reaching out actively to those that need help and – but also making sure that people understand that this is a program that’s intended to help those who truly need help.The other thing that we opted to do is really take more of a rifle shot approach to the market environment we find ourselves in. And rather than come out early when conditions were really just a lot unknown at the time and just suggest that we’re going to treat everybody in the same way with these following programs, we really elected to instead take it sort of month by month, approach it on a case-by-case basis in some cases, which gives us the ability to adapt and change as conditions evolve.And so, I think we took a very measured approach to things, and a lot of communication went on with residents and with our associates at the properties. And I think through all that, it resulted in a collection performance that we feel pretty good about.
Neil Malkin: All right. Great. I appreciate that. One last quick one on the accounting side. Are you planning on recognizing the delinquency, sort of netting that against billed revenue? Or are you going to recognize that on a GAAP or FFO basis and then have some sort of straight-line offset in AFFO?
Albert Campbell: Well, for the vast majority – Neil, this is Al. We certainly expect, once we release our earnings for the second quarter, that we’ll have a portion of – that we’ll have a bad debt reserve that identifies what we think will ultimately collect on some things. Important to note that the information we put in the press release this morning was on a cash basis. It really doesn’t reflect any of that.And so, anything we see in the second quarter and more flexibility will be a good thing for us. And it’s also important to note that the commercial side of our business, you mentioned straight-lining, at least the commercial side of our business, is much, much smaller than the 1.5% of our revenues. And for those ones, we are taking a month and pushing it to the end of the lease like many of the commercial operators are and spreading it out over the life of the lease.But for multifamily residents, yeah, we’re doing a normal collection process with a – ultimately have a bad debt reserve when we release second quarter earnings.
Neil Malkin: Okay. I guess what I’m trying to get at is, if you have, let’s say, 2% delinquency, you wouldn’t report that as like sort of 98% of rent collected. You’d report it as 100% and then just discount it by whatever you think the uncollectible bad debt is. Is that correct?
Albert Campbell: That’s exactly right. I mean, so what we’re showing you is – the point I’m trying to make is the information we’re showing in the release on April and on May is just gross, not collected rent at this point. 2.3% of our rent and fees together is uncollected, but from that, we have 1.3%, which is we have promises to pay, which we feel like we will collect the vast majority of them. And put us in a much better position. So when we report our earnings for the second quarter, we will have likely reported revenue for a large part of that.
Neil Malkin: Thank you. Well, I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning, everybody. Just curious, Brad or Eric, the calls that you’ve received from developers looking for capital been related to new starts, like projects that are under construction or projects that are in lease-up. And then, can you give us a sense of where you think terms are for financing today, best guess?
Bradley Hill: Well, Austin, this is Brad. The calls we’re getting so far are for new starts. I mean I think it’s too early really to start getting calls for deals that are in lease-up, but as I indicated in my comments, I do think that there’s going to be some pressure on the new lease-up segment, and we will start getting those calls. I don’t know when that’s going to materialize. We don’t know when that’s going to be.But the calls we’re getting right now are from developers who thought they had their debt and equity lined up. And they’re 2 months out from starting construction. And now they have no debt, they have no equity. So those are the calls we’re getting right now. And as I said, we’re getting a lot of those calls, because we looked at a lot of those deals originally and may be another equity source, got the deal for whatever reason.But it’s too early, we think, to really kick off any of those deals. We need a little bit more time to let kind of the cloud settle around us.In terms of debt terms, they’re certainly worse than they were before COVID-19 hit. I think, certainly, LTVs are down really across the board. There’s additional requirements that are going to affect the proceeds that borrowers are going to get. They’re looking at trailing 3 months operations, which are going to be impacted by what’s going on around us, some more so than others. So that’s going to affect the proceeds that folks are getting and should, as I said, lead to additional opportunities for us on the buy side.But there are additional requirements that agencies are putting on buyers that are hampering their ability to get their max proceeds right now. But the spreads have come down from the end of March, so they’re not as bad as they have been. They’re getting somewhat better.
Austin Wurschmidt: So as you think about underwriting cost today, just curious, where do you think costs are today versus pre-COVID?
Bradley Hill: Well, contractors are not quick to lower their pricing. I think it’s going to still take some time before we see a potential reduction in price kind of come through the system. I mean, from a sub standpoint, they still have jobs that they’re working on right now. I think, certainly the new deals that they’re pricing will start to trend down, but I think that’s going to be a few months before you start seeing some cost reductions come through the system. It’s not going to be immediate.
Austin Wurschmidt: That’s helpful. Thank you. And then as it relates to operations, you guys had previously focused on pushing rates at the risk of maybe losing some occupancy. And as you alluded to, I believe, occupancy is going to become more of a focus. Do you think there’s room or enough demand to re-ramp occupancy in the coming months?
Thomas Grimes: What we’ve seen – we made that shift pretty quickly. We saw a falloff in move-ins in late March that has recovered. And we have – our demand metrics are pretty good right now, right. Austin, what I’d say, but I would say we’re treading water at this point. We’ve got enough demand to hold on. And then it really just depends on how the economy shakes out, and that will be – that will vary across the Sunbelt based on locations. But we will be looking at prioritizing occupancy. Exposure has flattened a bit, which is encouraging as we head into the higher exposure time of the year, so – and cautiously optimistic on our ability to hold the line.
Austin Wurschmidt: I understood. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Maybe just following up on Austin’s question there, just specific to renewals, I mean, we’ve seen NMHC and some of your public peers come out and say they’re not going to have any rate increases on renewals, but looks like you were able to continue to push through with pretty healthy renewals in April. So first of all, how do you think about that relative to those recommendations? And then second of all, do you have a sense of what your private competition is doing in terms of renewals within your markets?
Eric Bolton: Well, Nick, this is Eric. Again, what I would say is that we are absolutely committed to helping those people that need help that have been financially impacted by this pandemic, and we really believe that the best way to help those people who need help is to expect the other aspects of our operation to perform as they should or as expected to the extent possible. And so what we elected to do is take this a month at a time. Conditions have changed radically in the last 60 days, and going out and making a 90-day commitment and taking kind of a shotgun approach and applying it to everybody just seem to be – to us to be not the right way to go.And in the end, as I say, we don’t think it allows us to be as helpful as we could be to everybody that really does need help, so we elected to take more of a rifle shot approach and take a more measured approach on kind of a month-to-month basis.The other thing I would throw in that I think is important to keep in mind is that we have a lot of confidence in our pricing platform and our pricing system. If you – obviously, you recall. I mean we have the luxury of having been through a couple of pretty big mergers in the last few years, companies that were operating on the same system that we were operating on, in the same markets that we were operating on. We’ve learned a lot through that process.And we have a very active, very hands-on approach to how we think about pricing, and therefore, we think that, that system and all the input variables that drive those recommendations ought to be allowed to play out. And if our system suggests that all the conditions that we’re looking at today support the ability to put through some level of rent increase, we’re going to allow the system to do its thing.Now having said that, in this environment, we’re also very quick to provide ample space for our on-site folks to negotiate, we do not, in this environment, want to lose people that we don’t really need to from a perspective relating to a rent increase. So we do negotiate at some level. But I think when you put all that together, it sort of drives the result that we have, and that’s really how we think about it.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just the other part was on what your private competition is doing. Do you have a sense that they’re also increasing renewals?
Eric Bolton: Be honest with you, I don’t know what the private guys are doing. We’ve not heard any comments. I mean, we monitor our comps very, very actively as part of our revenue management practices, and I’m certain, in some cases, there are some that are not putting through increases and some are. But it all factors into our pricing dynamic and market factors.
Thomas Grimes: Yeah. And Nick, I would just say, based on industry conversation here and there with private peers, it’s the mix that Eric outlines.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Sumit Sharma: This is Sumit in for Nick. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, focusing on expenses a bit. What drivers do you have to keep the costs at Q1 levels? Because I know you mentioned that you’re looking at expense growth, which is still in line with – both in line with prior guidance or prior trends. And you mentioned an increase in marketing spend, while some of your peers are actually reporting the opposite. So I just wanted to get a sense of how should we think about your expense growth for this year versus what you had stated earlier in the year?
Albert Campbell: This is Al. I’ll give you a few comments on that, and Tom may want to give something on the marketing as well. But for the first quarter, as you mentioned, I think the 2 areas, the biggest increase of all was really – that made the biggest impact was property taxes is over 1/3 of our costs. And so as we talked about going into the year, that played out as expected. It grew 3.5%. Marketing also grew about 11% as you saw in the release, almost 12%. But as a dollar value, it’s much smaller, the overall expense structure, so really had less of overall impact. And Tom can talk about what our plans are there.As we look at the rest of the year, as we talked about a little bit in the comments, we expect – hard to know exactly what’s going to happen this year certainly, but expenses are – we would expect to have less of an impact certainly than revenues. And largely, we expect our costs to be close to what we projected at the beginning of the year. The 2 major items are personnel and taxes in terms of size, and we don’t see any reason right now that they would be significantly out of line of what our expectations were.And we also expect some of our repair and maintenance costs or turn costs, if you would, maybe to be favorable, because fewer people will leave us. And then offsetting that, we mentioned a bit in the comments was the marketing costs because of the competitive environment and maybe a little bit of utilities costs, because people are with us and they’re sheltering at home and those kind of things. But Tom, do you have anything to add?
Thomas Grimes: Yeah. I would just add on the operating side of the opportunities. As Al touched on R&M, we’ll probably see some relief as turnover lowers. And then as our self-touring platform gets into place and gets moving, we really understand what implications that has for efficiency, there may be some opportunity there. Marketing, as Al mentioned, is a lower dollar amount, but we’re going to be competitive in the paid search area. It’s probably never more important to be active in that area and I don’t see an opportunity for savings in that area.
Sumit Sharma: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Hardik Goel: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. As we think about the full year on the pricing power front, you guys mentioned sending out renewals around the 4% range. So would that mean that those are the renewals that will get booked in May and June? And is there a negotiation that happens where you don’t actually book the 4%, you book something lower? Or is that a good bogey for what May and June renewals will look like?
Thomas Grimes: Yeah. We do some negotiation as that comes out, but it’s generally between 50 and 80 basis points.
Hardik Goel: Got it. And just on the new lease front, what is the prospect on that becoming a positive number? How long does that take? Is that something that can snap back quickly in – by 4Q? And I know it’s really difficult, because we don’t know how the economy will recover. But right now we’re seeing some negative numbers, and I’m just wondering how to think about that.
Thomas Grimes: No. It is – it can be fairly responsive. I mean new lease rate is sensitive. So if the economy recovers quickly, that will shift to positive quite quickly, especially if it happens over the summer months if the economy is slower to get going, but that will stay negative for a period of time. And it’s really just a function of the economy, and I don’t have the goggles to see exactly how that’s going to play out right now. But it is sensitive, and if it comes back, we will see it and we will adjust.
Hardik Goel: Thanks so much. And lastly, if you indulge me for just one more, are you offering flexible lease terms on renewals? Or are you being careful about how your rent roll gets impacted? People want to move to a 3-month lease or 2-month lease. What are the options?
Thomas Grimes: The options are multiple. As Eric mentioned, we’ve got a pretty sophisticated approach to this, and we price our units to really guide folks to the right term that fits with our lease exploration guideline. So it was more beneficial for them to rent in a month, where we have capacity in it, and it is more expensive to rent in a month that has less capacity. And they have quite a few options at renewal. And they can sort of – they can decide what’s best for them, and that generally guides to what’s best for us.
Hardik Goel: Got it. Thanks so much.
Thomas Grimes: You bet.
Operator: Next question is from John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead.
John Guinee: Great. Thank you. I’m just looking at your development page. Have you, it might be too early, but have you re-underwritten your expected yield on costs and adjusting for expected, maybe a modest decrease in asking rents during lease-up?
Bradley Hill: Yeah. This is Brad, John. No. At this point, we’ve not adjusted anything on our development underwriting at the moment. I think it’s really just too early to tell on that frankly. The average period of stabilization for our deals is a couple of years out. So we’ve got some time on our development platform, really, to see how, as Tom said, the economy goes, and that’s really what’s going to affect our yields on those deals. So at this point, we’ve not adjusted anything there, and we think that our original underwriting is still intact given the amount of time that we have on these deals before we start hitting our lease-up periods.
John Guinee: So thinking about, say, The Greene in Greenville, South Carolina or Copper Ridge in Fort Worth, you’re still essentially – the same asking rents exist today that existed 3 months ago.
Bradley Hill: We’re in line on those 2 properties, but I think it is worth monitoring.
John Guinee: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.
Richard Anderson: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I think, Eric, you said that in April – or maybe it was Tom, in April that your leasing activity is up 6% year-over-year. Did I hear that correctly?
Thomas Grimes: Not for April, Rich. This is Tom. But for the last couple of weeks, it is now – our leasing is about 6% over prior year’s levels, yes. But not for the entire month.
Richard Anderson: Okay. So how the heck is that happening? Sorry to put it that way. But I mean, you’re obviously operating with much fewer resources. How do you explain that?
Thomas Grimes: It’s a change in our behavior, and I think it’s a change in our customers’ behavior. And I suspected there’s a little bit of a recovery where it was down close to 50% in late March. So Rich, we’ve really shifted the entire – our offices are staffed, but have been closed to the public in terms of visitors. But our teams are there to facilitate both virtual and self-tours, and that there has been incredible response to that. Our conversion ratios on the self-tours are very, very good as you would expect, but it’s really just changing from probably a customer preference and gearing towards guided tours first to virtual and self-tours first, and those have gone quite well.
Richard Anderson: Has the fact that you’ve had a lot more tenant retention also aided that number?
Thomas Grimes: I mean, those 2 numbers are standalone. That’s helped us hold the line. Our leasing is up. Then move-ins will come up, and we’ve got a chance to sort of stabilize from there. But in the sense of, if fewer people give notice, we have fewer to lease, that is a good thing. But the 6% increase in leasing is really just on volume of new leases and is not related to the amount of turnover.
Richard Anderson: Okay. In terms of the sending out renewals at, I think it was 4% for future, we saw it, this month and next, how has been the response to that? I mean, I imagine in this environment, your tenants are expecting some handouts or what have you. Has there been some eye rolling? Or is it – it’s sort of like, okay, we get it type of response. I’m just curious, practically speaking, how is that…?
Thomas Grimes: Yeah. Well, I mean, first, and as Eric outlined in some earlier comments, we’re working really hard to identify who’s affected by COVID. We’re seeking them out. We are working with them, and we are doing everything we can to support them. So that group is being taken care of in that manner. On the response to the renewal offers in general, for May, June and early look in July, our accept rates are running 3.5 to 4 percentage points higher than this time last year, and so the response is, frankly, pretty good. Again, we are going directly to those folks affected by COVID by asking – trying to identify and working with them. And then the other folks are responding to the offers quite well.
Richard Anderson: Okay. Great. In terms of the commentary around a lot of your states starting the process of opening up and getting the economy moving, are you – but there are a lot of businesses behind that, that are going by their own rules and perhaps delaying out of abundance of caution or whatever. How will you as a company in that region respond? Will you just follow the guidelines of the states? Or do you have your own kind of more conservative approach to opening up, so to speak, your businesses?
Thomas Grimes: Yeah. We are – it is different by market what is accepted and what is guided, and we are adjusting by market. Most of our leasing offices are opening this week for guided tours under sort of strict guidelines, social distancing, crowd kind of control, if you will, belt and stanchion, those kind of items. And then the amenities are really following the local guidance, and I would expect amenities to be opened by the end of May in most of the Sunbelt locations.
Richard Anderson: Okay. Last question for me. And this promise to pay sort of payment plan, 1.3% in April, how formalized is that? I mean are they signing something and that gives – lends itself to perhaps more certainty? Or is this sort of like – I don’t know, like a pinky swear type of thing?
Thomas Grimes: No, no.
Eric Bolton: It’s an agreement. It’s an amendment to the lease. It’s an executed legal document.
Richard Anderson: Okay. Okay. Wonderful. Thanks very much, everyone.
Operator: Going next to Zach Silverberg with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Zachary Silverberg: Hi. Thanks you for taking my question. Just a follow-up on Rich’s. How high do you think retention can go? And how much benefit do you think that can have to the revenue and expense side?
Thomas Grimes: I mean there’s what I hope for and what I know, and it is difficult to estimate. We’re in a time period where rules that were normal have changed, and we’ve just got to wait and see.
Eric Bolton: Well – and I think what you have to recognize is when you start thinking about the reasons that people leave us, the number 1 reason people leave us is, because they make a decision to go buy a home. And we certainly think that, that reason is less of a pressure point today for all the sort of broad economic worries that are out there. That’s unlikely to be ramping up anytime soon. But another big reason, and frankly, what has been slightly ahead of even people moving to buy a home lately, has been because of a change in their job, employment status change.And I think that, that continues to probably be the variable that will be the most impactful in terms of changing turnover behavior. And again, given the uncertainty in the economy, broadly right now, I don’t think there’s going to be a lot of job hopping going around. I mean, certainly, those that have jobs are probably glad to have them and going to hold on to them.The third biggest reason people leave us is, because they didn’t want to pay the rent increase. And frankly, what we’ve been doing is backing off on that as we’ve been talking about here. So I think when you start to look at all the reasons behind it, it – we’re optimistic that we’re going to continue to see turnovers stay fairly low for some time. I think we’re going to have to see the economy really start to pick up before we begin to see turnover return back to where it was. And how low it goes or how high retention goes or how low turnover goes is kind of hard to say right now.
Thomas Grimes: To add a data point to Eric’s commentary, April turnover was down 8%. That was driven by a 13% decrease in job transfer.
Zachary Silverberg: Got it. Got it. I appreciate the color. And just one more. Can you guys speak to any – or have you seen any benefits from your investments in technology in either the operations or leasing side? And then does this sort of prove any future ramp-up in investment or underwriting?
Thomas Grimes: Yeah. No, I mean the overhaul platform has performed quite well, and we’re thrilled with that progress. I think the place that it points to, though, the most is continued self-touring and automation on the sales side of things. Our teams are handling that process quite well, and we would expect that to continue to develop at a good clip.
Zachary Silverberg: That’s it for me. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thank you. Al, do you have any early reads on how municipalities are going to be approaching property tax assessments in the next 12 to 24 months? And are they going to back off or are they just – are they going to keep coming for their money?
Albert Campbell: No, it’s a great question, John. We spent a lot of time trying to try to dig into that, and what we’re seeing right now is it’s just too early to tell. We are seeing – obviously, for us, the main states are Texas, Florida and Georgia. And what we’re seeing right now is most – some of the states, Texas, most prominently is pointing back to the assessments for taxes that are set beginning of the year, January 1. And the pandemic, most people are saying right now, doesn’t apply for a change in that. So for 2020, they’re going to stick to those plans, and any changes will roll through 2021.And we certainly expect there will be some pressure on that from people. There will also be pressure from states and localities trying to get their budgets balanced. So I think what we would say is 2020 is probably not going to change much from what our early expectations are. But as we roll into 2021, if economic impact continues to persist and revenues continue to climb, you’ll likely see some impact.And what we did see in the last downturn, we went back and looked, was in the states that are biggest, Florida, Texas, Georgia, we did see, ultimately, those guys gave pretty good reprieve, but it took 6 months to a year. It took the next cycle for them to do that. And so, long story short, I think that’s what we’ll see this time.
John Pawlowski: Got it. That makes sense. And then, last one for me. I’m trying to get a sense for what your guys’ pricing power or cash collections would look like in a world without this fiscal stimulus cranking. And so, any sense from late March or early April – I know it’s very tough to extrapolate weekly data points. But any sense for any guesses of what April occupancy or cash collections would have looked like without the unemployment insurance benefits hitting and some other fiscal stimulus measures?
Eric Bolton: Well, I think – John, this is Eric. I think what you have to recognize is that, frankly, a lot of our region of the country was slower to shut down than what you see happening in lot of other areas of the country. And it’s also showing signs of opening up faster. So we didn’t really see the unemployment claims starting to trend up until really well into April and across a number of our states.And when you look at the kind of weight our performance – of our portfolio of states, if you will, we continue to run at unemployment claims as a percentage of the employment base that at percentages lower than national average. And so, I think that while certainly the unemployment claims ramped up starting in sort of mid-April, over the last part of April has been helpful.I think that – we don’t think that that factor has been a huge tailwind for us. Certainly, it has helped. But the other thing to keep in mind is that average rent to income of our portfolio at 20%, it’s a pretty affordable region of the country to live in, and dollar goes a lot further in our region of the country. And so, I think that – we think that while certainly there’s been some benefit from some of these federal assistance programs, I would suggest that it’s not a huge tailwind for us.
John Pawlowski: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.
Operator: We’ll go next to Steve Brunner with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Steven Brunner: Hey, guys. Just a quick question about some of the redevelopment you’re doing. In the earnings document, you call out the 10 properties you’re currently working on. Five of which you’re – looks like you’re going through with, but the other 5 you’re putting on hold it looks like. Are there any indications or any sort of benchmarks you guys are looking for, for when you’re going to restart or start working on those 5 properties? Or conversely, any indicators which would sort of incentivize you to push those out until next year?
Thomas Grimes: Yeah. I think it’s a total of 10 properties in – or actually be working forward with 8 of those where we feel like the price-to-value gap we can still narrow in those markets. Even with pressure on the newer stuff in the high end. They’re in great locations where we’re on price/value alternative, and we can still make a difference.It will also – they’ll be delivering and finishing in the late fourth quarter, early first quarter of next year. We feel good about how they’re coming. That pipeline of opportunity of, sort of, let’s say, late 2000, early – or late 1990s, early 2000s product, that is extremely well positioned. We feel like that pipeline goes well beyond these 10. And we will be underwriting and looking for the next round as we move into 2021.
Steven Brunner: So just to confirm, it looks like you’re pretty much going to go through with 8 out of those 10, even worst-case scenario this year. And those other 2, I guess, you’re just waiting to be opportunistic with what’s going on in the...
Thomas Grimes: Yeah, we were just frozen on those 2. They’ll likely tee up, honestly, in early 2021.
Steven Brunner: Perfect. Thanks so much. That’s all I got.
Thomas Grimes: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Richard Skidmore: Thank you. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. First, just on the demand trends in late April and May, and with your markets starting to open, are you seeing anything that would suggest migration out of urban to more suburban relative to the COVID pandemic?
Thomas Grimes: I think there is anecdotal evidence for that, and we would expect that. But with such an early pickup and where our leasing is coming from, it’s difficult to get that read. We’ll have a better look at that in shifts as we finish the second quarter and the busy leasing season.
Richard Skidmore: Got it. Understood. And then just following up on Texas specifically, are you seeing anything with regards to what’s happening in the energy patch and how it might impact your markets in Texas? It looks like first quarter was actually pretty strong for you in Texas, but anything new on the margin in April and May?
Thomas Grimes: We were monitoring Houston. That had a little bit higher level of requests for COVID-affected jobs there. And we’re watching oil and gas there. And that is a bit of a worry for us. But Austin and Dallas are hanging in there with the portfolio. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to a follow-up from Hardik Goel with Zelman. Please go ahead.
Hardik Goel: Hey, guys. Just really quick, can you just give us more color on the way traffic is calculated? Does it include the online traffic and the virtual tour traffic? And as a comparison, what would traffic be for the last couple of weeks with just the physical traffic being counted?
Thomas Grimes: Yeah. No, it’s moved around a little bit. So what we have is leads, which is an expressed interest. We have traffic or visits, which is actually a physical visit to the property. And then we have leases, which is someone who signed an application. There’s been a lot of moving around in that. So what I would tell you is leads and move-ins dipped as I outlined in late March. And leads and move-ins have grown, have recovered to above 6% of normal levels.Traffic, which is visits to the property, has remained relatively low, because more of our leases are being executed by virtual or self-touring, but primarily virtual. So our closing ratio, which we used to think of as a method of visits to lease, we thought 20% is good. We’re running 56% to 70% on that, because if you’re coming out to see us at this point, there’s a very good chance that you will close.So I think we’re kind of monitoring the lead side of it. And we’re monitoring, are we actually getting leases. Traffic or visits is a number that has less meaning today than it did 6 months ago.
Eric Bolton: We will certainly expect, now that our leasing offices are opening back up the doors this week, we expect on-site visits to really start to ramp up. They’ve been nonexistent for the last few weeks, because the doors were locked, and we were doing it all virtual. But as the doors are opening up this week, we think the traffic levels will start to pick up.
Hardik Goel: So that’s great color. Thank you so much.
Eric Bolton: You bet.
Operator: And it does appear we have no further questions. I’ll return the floor to our presenters for closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: Well, we appreciate everyone joining us, and I’m sure we’ll be talking to a number of you virtually for our upcoming June meetings with NAREIT, so thank you very much.
Operator: And this will conclude today’s program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the companies will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, January 30th, 2020.I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. Please go ahead.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Priscilla. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are; Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Brad Hill, Executive Vice President and Head of Transactions.Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I would like to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday’s earnings release and our ‘34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results.These reports along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com.I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim and good morning. Our first – fourth quarter results were better than expected has improved rent growth and record low resident turnover continue to drive positive trends and overall revenue performance. Over the course of last year, we focused on an opportunity to prioritize rent growth and push that agenda throughout the year. As a result, we carry good pricing momentum into the New Year.Based on our updated analysis, we do now expect that the overall level of new supply deliveries in 2020 will run higher than in 2019. This will of course vary by market. As has been routinely commented on, the majority of the new supply continues to be higher end product at a high price point.Based on our detailed submarket analysis, it’s important to note that the new supply forecasted to deliver in our markets in 2020 will be at rents that on average will be 25% higher than the rent across our properties in the same submarkets.While we are certainly not immune to the impact of new supply, we see this pricing gap is generating good long-term opportunity, the price point of our portfolio, the quality of our locations, the diversified nature of our submarkets, the strength of our operating platform and a number of new initiatives that we are rolling out in 2020, along with the pricing momentum that was built in calendar year 2019 will continue to support steady growth in NOI over the coming year.One of the benefits surrounding the new and higher price product delivering into the market is the expanding redevelopment opportunity created at a number of our properties. The price spread between the new supply and the existing rents that our properties creates opportunity to upgrade and still off – offer attractive value to our leasing prospects, while also generating a very accretive use of shareholder capital.Our property upgrade and repositioning pipeline will expand in 2020, supporting above market rent growth at a number of locations over the next couple of years. We continue to find select opportunities to capture disciplined new external growth. We began the year with our new development pipeline at 2,100 units, representing $490 million in new investment. In addition, we have 640 new units undergoing initial lease-up, representing $146 million in additional new investment.We did close on one new acquisition in Q4, consistent with the transactions we executed on over the past few years, this was a newly built property undergoing initial lease-up, we partially match funded the acquisition with new equity issue through our ATM program, thereby retaining plenty of growth capacity and protection for the balance sheet.So in summary, our Sunbelt markets continue to capture great demand. MAA’s portfolio is uniquely balanced and well positioned across the region to capture this demand. Our redevelopment and new development pipelines are growing. Emerging new technologies and products will also support further NOI growth and the balance sheet is in a great position with ample capacity to jump on compelling opportunities. I want to thank our team of associates here at MAA for a great year of performance in 2019 and we look forward to another year progress in 2020.I’ll turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Grimes: Thank you Eric and good morning, everyone. Our operating performance for the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations with the steady demand for apartments and our enhanced platform, we’ve continued momentum in rent growth and strong average daily occupancy. Same-store effective rent growth per unit increased 4.3% for the quarter, this is the seventh straight quarter of year-over-year improving ERU growth. As a result, our year-over-year same-store revenue growth was 4.1%, the highest it’s been since 2016. Effective rent per unit increased 60 basis points sequential – sequentially.Revenue performance was led by a steady momentum in blended new and renewal lease over lease pricing, up 2.6% for the quarter, which is a 100 basis points better than this time last year. In addition, average daily occupancy during the quarter remained strong at 95.7%.As we wrap up January average daily occupancy is still strong at 95.5% and compares to 96% in January of last year. Our 60-day exposure which is all vacant units and notices through a 60-day period is just 7.2%, 10 basis points better than this time last year.Looking forward as Eric mentioned, our overall supply in our markets is expected to increase expected increase in 2020. The Dallas, Houston and Savannah markets are expected to be the most challenging, based on our pricing progress last year, along with current rent and exposure trends, we expect our leading revenue markets to be Phoenix, Raleigh, Austin and Nashville.Of course, the new supply creates an opportunity for a redevelopment platform. In addition to our kitchen and bath program, we’re underway with an amenity upgrade program at 10 communities, there’s $20 million to $25 million investment in 2020, it’s primarily focused on legacy post assets, where the product was built in [excellent] [ph] locations, and new supply continues to push the rent of the submarket up. In these cases, we can update leasing centers, hallways and common areas create shared workspaces, outdoor gathering areas and rooftop decks to allow us to increase rent, while still offering compelling value in these submarkets.Our technology platform also continues to expand. Our overhaul – overhauled operating system and new website has contributed to our ability to attract, engage and create value for our residents. Our tests on smart homes have gone well. The technology was installed in 15 communities with minimal disruption has been well received by our residents. We expect to install 24,000 smart home units in 2020.Our high speed internet access initiative is deploying and will be a contributor to 2020 NOI growth. We’re also exploring a range of AI chat, customer resource management and prospect engagement tools. We’re pleased with the progress our teams made in 2019 and greatly appreciate their efforts, with a solid base of earned in rent growth as we head into 2020 and are excited about the opportunities ahead. Brad?
Brad Hill: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. I’ll provide brief comments on what we are seeing in the transaction market, as well as on our transaction activity at Q4. As you’re all aware, the transaction market continues to be extremely competitive with record levels of liquidity and demand for multifamily properties.Given the favorable migration and job growth trends that exist in our region of the country, investor demand for multifamily properties within our footprint continues to be robust, leading to deep better pools, aggressive pricing and compressed cap rates. Reflecting the positive job growth and strong demand, we expect supply to increase in 2020.This increased level of supply should continue to support a historically high level of acquisition and pre-purchase deal flow. We remain disciplined in our capital deployment decisions and Al and his team have our balance sheet in great shape, allowing us to respond to compelling investment opportunities as they materialize.As we’ve done in the past, we’ll continue to focus our acquisition efforts on new lease-ups. In Q4, we closed on the acquisition of The Greene in downtown Greenville, South Carolina. This was a recently completed asset, involving a developer and equity provider we’ve worked within the past. The asset was still in its initial lease-up with the equity requiring a certain and quick close by year end. We were able to execute on the acquisition at a stabilized market cap rate of 5.1%.In 2020, we’ll also continue to pursue pre-purchase opportunities. As a reminder, this is a program where we partner with good developers that have access to great real estate. We bring the capital to debenture in return – and in return, we get access to an asset at a reduced basis with a clear path to a 100% ownership at stabilization. This program allows us to selectively pick well located, to be built assets, while minimizing our overall development risk.In Q4, we closed and started construction on a 264 unit pre-purchase located nine miles southwest of downtown Orlando, in a very desirable high income, Dr. Phillips area. And finally in Q4, we took advantage of strong investor demand and pricing and sold all 5 of our assets and exited the Little Rock Arkansas market.We had over 25 qualified bidders offer on these properties. We achieved good pricing for this non-core market with 24-year old properties, equating to a 5.4% market cap rate. We will continue to selectively prune our portfolio on an ongoing basis and we’ll have more to say about our specific 2020 disposition plans in coming quarters.With that, I’ll turn the call over to Al.
Al Campbell: Thank you, Brad and good morning everyone. I’ll provide some brief commentary on the company’s fourth quarter earnings performance, major financing activity and then finally on our initial guidance for 2020.Reported FFO per share of $1.68 for the fourth quarter was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our guidance with majority of this outperformance produced by property NOI as both operating revenues and expenses were favorable to expectations for the quarter.FFO per share was $6.55 for the full year, which included several items considered unusual and not core to our business such as the market-to-market valuation of our preferred shares and gains on sales of land parcels. Excluding these non-core items, FFO for the full year would have been $6.26 per share. As to discuss more in a moment, we are providing earnings guidance for 2020 on a core FFO basis, which we believe will help provide a clear picture of performance.We’re active on the financing front during the fourth quarter as we issued $300 million of new public bonds. We also retired $170 million of unsecured loans and $17 million of debt – additional secured debt. The effective interest rate of the new bonds will be 3.1% over 10 years, after considering the interest rate hedges related to the financings.We ended the year with 98.4% of our debt fixed with an average duration of almost 8 years which is a record for the company. During the fourth quarter, we also issued $20 million in new equity through our ATM program, essentially match funding a portion of the Greenville property acquisition mentioned my Brad.Finally, we are providing initial earnings guidance for 2020 with the release, which is detailed in our Supplemental Information package. Providing guidance for net income per diluted common share, which is reconciled at FFO, core FFO and core AFFO in the supplement. Core FFO for the full year 2020 is projected to be $6.38 to $6.62 per share or $6.50 per share at the midpoint. The definition of core FFO including a description of the items considered non-core can be found in our supplemental package.The primary driver of 2020 earnings performance, the same-store NOI growth, which is projected to be 3.5% at the midpoint. Effective rent growth for the year is expected to be around 3.7% produced by 2020 lease-up release blended rental pricing growth of 3.4% at the midpoint, combined with the 2019 blended rental pricing of 4.4% achieved. This pricing combined with a slight decrease in average occupancy to 95.8% average for the year, brings projected total rental revenue to the 3.5% range.Fees and other income items combined or projected to add an additional 20 basis points to 25 basis points to revenue growth for the year, with the primary driver being a 55 basis points contribution from the Double Play bulk internet program, which is partially offset by other fees and reimbursement items which are projected to remain essentially flat for 2020, primarily due to slightly lower occupancy. These items combined to produce our total same-store revenue growth expectation of 3.75% for 2020 at the midpoint.Same-store operating expenses will continue to have some pressure from real estate taxes and insurance costs for the year and we’ll also have the additional expenses related to the Double Play bulk internet program which is recorded on a gross basis. These items combined to produce projected same-store expense growth a 4.25% for the full year at the midpoint.The forecast also assumes a modest increase in overall – of overhead cost just below 3% for the year and continue to use of our ATM program to essentially match fund expected acquisitions for the year with $80 million of new equity issuance projected of course, assuming we find accretive uses of capital during the year.And that’s all we have in the way of prepared comments, Priscilla. So now we’ll turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question today from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Brad, you mentioned supply is increasing in your markets in 2020, which I presume is off of your kind of detailed supply analysis. Could you quantify that thought and tell us which of your top markets have seen the biggest increases or decreases?
Tom Grimes: Hey – Austin, it’s Tom, I’m going to jump in. where, we really think that we’ll see the most pressure from new supply is in Dallas primarily it’ll continue to be challenged, but we’re – but it’s – that supplies coming in at 45% above our market – our [technical difficulty].And then I think we would expect that Houston, Savannah and Charleston will soften over time as supply comes online, but feel like we’ve got you know, Phoenix and Raleigh will probably lead the pack in terms of performance and we’ve also got strong momentum in the face of elevated supply with Austin, Atlanta and Nashville.
Brad Hill: And Austin real quick just to clarify when Tom says its supplies coming in at 45% on top of us that’s a rent gap between what we have in place with new supply that’s coming in is about 45% higher in rent than what our assets are.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yeah, that makes sense. And then what’s the supply sort of for the overall portfolio? What are kind of the numbers when you compare what it was in 2019 and what you’re expecting for this year?
Tom Grimes: Yeah. So if you look at our radius, supply as a percent of inventory, we’ll – this 2019 was about 1% of supply delivered and this year, it’ll be 1.6% in 2020.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. Thank you for that. And then kind of going back to the clarification on the rent for units being delivered versus what’s in place. Eric, you kind of highlighted that you know, across the overall portfolio, I think you said 25%. How does that 25% compared to the last two years to three years of where new supply was coming in versus you know, where your portfolio was at the time?
Tom Grimes: I don’t have those numbers right in front of me, Austin, but we reviewed them and it’s very similar to what it is this year.
Eric Bolton: I think as construction costs continue to escalate – our land costs continue to escalate, I think if you go back over the last several years, you’re going to find that that gap is going up. Certainly the rise in cost of construction is accelerating at a pace faster than unit growth is accelerating. So, I think if you go back over the last several years, you’ll find that that gap is probably spread somewhat.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you for the time.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Neil Malkin with Capital One. Your line is open.
Neil Malkin: Hey. Good morning, guys. First question on the operating expense side. Talked about implementing technology through several of the assets and units across your portfolio. I’m wondering if any of that is also pressuring operating expenses or is all that being capitalized? And then what are your expectations for payroll and insurance growth in 2020?
Al Campbell: Let me make sure I’m understanding, can you tell me what you – in the first portion, what expenditures were you talking about specifically, Neil, to make sure I’m clear?
Neil Malkin: Yeah, yeah. So the elevated operating expenses, because yours mostly related to the bulk internet program, but I thought you’re also implementing a smart home technology package. Are those –
Al Campbell: Okay. Okay, I know I got it. Yes, we are and a majority of that is capital. So just give you a little breakdown of the expenses. I think the midpoint as we talked about was 4.25% growth for the year and about 65 basis points that is related to the bulk internet program. And then, you have real estate taxes which are a third of our expenses as probably another 60 basis points. So if you strip all of that out, the other items, personnel, R&M, utilities, all those things are growing together about 3% for the year.
Tim Argo: You know, Neil, I’ll add to that you mentioned specifically insurance, we’re expecting you know probably low double-digit increase for insurance program which will renew in July.
Neil Malkin: Okay, great. You know recently there has been some pretty strong homebuilder confidence. I’m wondering if you’re seeing that you know, play out in any way or anecdotally in terms of the people who are moving out of, they’re moving out to home purchase, and/or if the builders are you know, starting to focus more on at the entry level homes or still the sort of higher price point homes?
Tom Grimes: No, we’ve not seen the folks move out for entry level homes, in fact, move out to home buying was down 10% this quarter, and that’s part of what continues to drive our turnover down.
Neil Malkin: Okay, I guess last one for me, can you just talk about what cap rates have done? Just talk about maybe in your top five markets you know, over the last maybe 6 months for you know, A and versus B product?
Brad Hill: Yeah. Hey, Neil this is Brad. You know, I’d say just broadly speaking, cap rates just continued to decline. I mean, certainly the demand for multifamily, if you heard anything about the NMHC Conference last week, where attendance was up record levels. So I think the demand for multifamily assets continues to be very, very strong.And you know, every indication we have and you know, from selling properties to be very, very active in the acquisition market and the numbers we’re seeing in cap rates continue to come down. And I’d say the gap between As and Bs continues to compress and you know, we don’t – we certainly don’t see anything changing you know, the liquidity in the market that’s really driving that at this point.
Neil Malkin: Thank you, guys, very much.
Brad Hill: Thanks Neil.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Nick Joseph with Citi. Your line is open.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I hope you can give a little more color on the bulk internet program. In terms of the contracts with the providers, how long are those typically and then from a rental perspective, do all units need to opt into the program or is there an opportunity to opt in or opt out?
Tom Grimes: No. On the first when there, 5 year to 7 year contracts depends on the provider and we’ve got the option to opt out for 3 years I believe but don’t hold me into that, Nick. On the – as the rollout goes, all residents participate in it. And when we did this, you know, we had the bulk cable program for a while, we decided to add high speed internet access.When we did that, we looked at our market and who’s already subscribing for high speed internet access and 80% of our residents are already paying for the speed that we’re providing or less. So it’s an upgrade and they’re paying less through us for that. Part of the reason that our results were a little better than we expected in the fourth quarter is, Nick, we really assume that would roll in on new leases on renewals, but the number of existing residents that chose to opt in mid lease was higher than we expected.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. That’s helpful. And then maybe to that point, where are you in terms of the rollout? And then how long will it take to be fully deployed?
Tom Grimes: We have one provider done and the next provider underway, and I would think we’d be deployed by May – fully deployed by May, with some carryover the benefit, of course in the 2020, because they’ll ramp up from there.
Nick Joseph: Right, thank you.
Tom Grimes: Sure.
Operator: We’ll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
John Kim: Thank you. Tom, in your prepared remarks you mentioned current occupancy is at 95.5%, which is 50 basis points lower than last year. Can you just comment on how concerned you are that occupancy may come in at the low end of your guidance or potentially lower than that given new supply?
Tom Grimes: No, [technical difficulty] as you will have noticed for the last year, we’ve really felt like and continue to feel that with demand, the way that it is now is the time to raise rents and build our effective occupancy and that is the basis for which our steady rent growth from quarter-to-quarter and the growth that we’ve seen throughout the year is built. And we’re willing to give up a little bit of occupancy on that though, 95.5%, very solid from our perspective.But we feel pretty good about that this time of the year I’ll expect it to be a little lower than I would expect that you’ll see that climb as the year goes on, but we’re certainly not going to be shooting for 96.2% to 96.4% you know, we’re very happy in the range that we’re in and it’s starting right where we thought it would.
John Kim: And can you provide commentary on how you see job growth or other demand drivers in your markets this year versus last year?
Tom Grimes: Yeah. I mean, job growth, we see no slowdown at this point. And the – you know, we continue to see interest in the Sunbelt and in migration trends, renewal rates continue to stay in the 6% to 7% range right now. So we’d anticipate those coming down a bit this year. But right now, demand is very strong and for that reason, we’ll continue to prioritize rent growth.
John Kim: Okay. And then your development pipeline increased to $490 million this quarter. Can you just comment on how big you feel comfortable with the pipeline is going forward? And are you developing at any different spec as far as adding smart home technology or any new technology as part of the development program?
Eric Bolton: This is Eric, John. I – you know, we’re very comfortable where the development pipeline is at this point. I mean, we’ve established the tolerance that we felt very comfortable with, the 3% to 4% of enterprise value, which should put the pipeline tolerance, if you will, at $500 million to $700 million. So at $490 million we’re pretty comfortable with where it is at this point.We have several other projects that we’re working on now, if you will, in a predevelopment sense, that we will start anything else this year. We do have a couple of land sites that we either own or tied up, but I suspect it will be early ‘21 before we’ll get those projects going. So we’re very comfortable with where the pipeline is at this point. And yes, as this new product is being developed, the smart home technology and a lot of the new technology services and products that Tom has alluded to, they were certainly a part of you know, what we build going forward.
John Kim: Great, thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Bank. Your line is open.
Zach Silverberg: Hi, Zach Silverberg here with Haendel. Just a quick follow-up on John’s question. How do you guys view new development yields against IRRs and how do they turn against IRRs compared to acquisitions?
Eric Bolton: You know, we’re generally seeing right now that our stabilized yields out of our development are somewhere in the 100 basis points to 125 basis points higher than what we are capturing on the acquisitions as Brad alluded to The Greene, the deal we bought in Greenville stabilized yield that just over 5%. We’re seeing our stable – our projected stabilized yields on our development pipeline right now trending anywhere from 6% to 6.5%. So you know, call it a 100 basis points, 125 basis points spread.
Zach Silverberg: All right, thanks. And could you provide an update on the quarter and year-to-date leased rates between those legacy post portfolio and the MAA portfolio? And is there any extra opportunity that we should view this year between the two of them?
Tom Grimes: Yeah, we do – or I do not have that information in front of me, we’ve largely narrowed that gap or that gap is narrowed, to be honest with you and differences between post and Mid America assets in the same submarket are negligible. Now going forward as I touched on with our redevelopment program and amenity upgrade, we do still have opportunities in those very strong locations to update the exterior and amenity packages there, and that is more of a 2021 impact that we’ll see from the work that we do –
Eric Bolton: Tom is referring to the post – the legacy post locations for the upgrades, so we’ll probably see more robust rent growth emerge out of the post, but it’s more a function of the upgrade as opposed to market differences.
Zach Silverberg: All right, that’s all for me. Thanks for the time guys.
Operator: We’ll go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Tom, so same-store revenue guidance is 3.25% to 4.25%. What do you expect – where are you expecting your top markets to come out? Where are you expecting the bottom performers to come out? What’s the sort of spread that under – underpins that 3.75% midpoint?
Tom Grimes: I mean, Rob, [technical difficulty] that range to be on a blended basis, the top markets in that – probably in that for 4%, 4.5% range and the bottom markets in the 2%, 2.5% something like that. I’m estimating that to be honest with you, but that’s rough feedback.
Rob Stevenson: Okay, so nobody is sort of close to flat or even negative or anything. It’s all sort of at least 1%, 1.5% positive at the bottom end?
Tom Grimes: Correct. I think on a blended basis, we would expect to get a full year traction and not have many people go backwards.
Eric Bolton: And Rob, I’ll tell you, you know, this is Eric. I mean, to some degree, the opportunity that we carry from 2019 into 2020, because of the focus on prioritization, on rent growth, it really puts us in a much better position to work through some of the supply pressures in these markets in 2020 and really enables us to avoid any the real weak performance metrics that you might – that you know, you were alluding to as a possibility. I think that, you know, we knew we’re heading into this year that we likely would see some moderation or some sort occur and that was part of the reason behind the logic of focusing so intently on the rent growth last year, which really helps us this year.
Rob Stevenson: Where are you guys – on that topic I mean, how are you guys thinking about turnover for 2020 I mean, it was only 47% last year. I mean, are you anticipating it being sort of flattish, are you expecting more contraction, some re-expansion there? And how big of a benefit is that to you if it stays low from an earnings standpoint?
Tom Grimes: Yeah, as far as our expectation, we expect it to be up slightly, we don’t see any fundamental changes coming across the board, but it is, you know, honestly hard to assume that it will continue to drop, and that plays into our earnings forecast really minimally at this point, Al may add some color.
Al Campbell: If you look at what we’ve got done then for occupancy, we’ve given ourselves about 15 basis points decline, there’s a little bit of increase in turnover applied and but nothing significant I would say.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And did I hear you guys correctly that you’re going to do 24,000 smart home unit installs in 2020?
Tom Grimes: That is correct, Rob.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And what is the cost for that? How much you’re doing per unit?
Tom Grimes: The average cost on that is $1,300 on the install and that gives you locks, thermostat, two lights, two moisture system sensors and an interactive flat panel display that’s the resident interface as well as their app.
Al Campbell: And it’s more things that’s it’s important I think and doing your model, Rob, there the smart home program plus the amenity redevelopments that Tom has talked about we’re investing about $60 million in capital this year in that, which is very strong returns, but a lot of that will begin to come more strongly in 2021.
Rob Stevenson: Okay, so I mean, in terms of units, though, that you redevelop in 2020, you know, instead of being 6,000 is that going to be wrapped up or is that going to be separate? So in other words, are you going from essentially 6,000 to 7,500 a unit on the redevelopment or I assume there might be some sort of cost savings if you’ve got to open up walls and do whatever anyway, but I mean, is that going to be wrapped up into a higher redevelopment per unit cost for the you know, whatever number of units you do redevelopment, interior or full scale redevelopment on?
Tom Grimes: Sure. And a lot of those programs are separate. And the reason that they are separate is because the timing is different in them. And if you remember on the kitchen and bath redevelopment, we do that on turn, when we install smart homes, we go in and we do the whole property at one time and then move people on to the product. So those programs are independent of one another.
Al Campbell: And that’s really why I mentioned them, Rob, this is Al, if you think about it, the program that we’ve done for many years into your redevelopment part we’ll continue along at basically the same pace call it, 7 – 7,000 to 8,000 units at you know, 5,000 to 6000 per unit spinning on that and that’s been the same level and that’ll have a contribution to earnings growth.On top of that, are the two programs that Tom was mentioning, the amenity redevelopment and of course, the smart home and those together about an additional $60 million that are great investments that have begun to pay off more in 2020 and that was really a point as we model it to help you lay that in right.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then just last one for me, Al. Property taxes especially elevated any specific markets?
Al Campbell: You know continues to be the same with tenders flow. I mean, what we have this year, when the beginning in the year you don’t know a lot, we’ll go back to that, Rob and what we do know is about a third of our portfolio is a revaluation year, we continue to expect pressure in Florida, Texas, maybe North Carolina a little bit this year. So we dial that in and so we know overall, we do expect our costs to come down a little bit, you know, the 4% to 5% range is 4.5% midpoint is about 50 basis points down.And also, you know, we’re cautiously optimistic about some of the changes in Texas, the new law changes hard to know where that’s going to play out over the next few years. We don’t yet know how that’s going to affect both millage rates or valuations. So we dialed in what we think we’re going to have and over time, we’re hopeful that line begins to come down a bit, that 4.5% in 2020 is our expectation.
Rob Stevenson: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Hardik Goel: Hey guys, how are you? Thanks for taking my question here. I actually wanted to touch upon supply again. The way we look at it, it doesn’t seem to be as impactful as maybe you’ve mentioned. Beyond Dallas and Houston, the two markets that you’ve highlighted, can you give us a sense for supply and your, you know, maybe secondary, tertiary markets and how that’s shaping up?
Tom Grimes: Sure, probably the market with the secondary group with the largest impact is probably Charleston moving from 2.3% as a percent of inventory to 4.8%. Now we’re a little encouraged by that, because the – where the supply has been, where it lines up to our A assets is in Mount Pleasant and the Mount Pleasant moratoriums have finally taken an effect. And so while Charleston has seen higher, that supply has moved to the Upper Peninsula area, which is as you know is across the Ravenel Bridge from Mount Pleasant.So we’ve – we’re a little bit optimistic there. But again, you know, we see Charlotte at 2.5% to 3.7%, others in the secondary market on our – Greenville goes from 2.1% of supply to 2.3%. So, not a lot of change. They’re probably the other market that has the biggest increased delta between 19 to 20 years in Savannah, Georgia you know, in 2019, they delivered 3% of the existing supply – market supply into the market in 2020 that jumps to 7%.Now you recognize, Savannah is only 2% of our same-store NOI so it’s not a huge impact, but it’s kind of hit or miss you know, somewhere up a little bit, somewhere up or more than others, but because of the diversified nature of our capital across these particularly secondary markets, you know, we – it’s not particularly significant, but you know it varies a bit by market.
Hardik Goel: And just one quick follow-up, could you share the new and renewal for the quarter?
Tom Grimes: Yeah, sure. The new for the quarter was 90 basis points down renewal 7% blended 2.6%, which is a 100 basis points better than last year.
Hardik Goel: Thanks. That’s all.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question today from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Your line is open.
Rich Anderson: Hey, thanks. Good morning.
Eric Bolton: Hey, Rich.
Rich Anderson: So last year, your same-store growth sort of cadence, kind of climbed over the course of the year from 2.5% on the NOI line to 5% to end the year out in the fourth quarter. I’m wondering if that means sort of a mirror image in 2020 where, you know, you start the year somewhat stronger than you end it on the basis of, you know, increasingly tougher comps?
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean, certainly I think the prior year comparisons will be a little bit more challenging for us this year. A lot of the momentum that we had last year was a function of our, you know, clear focus that we had that going into last year about focusing on rent growth, you know, at the expense of a low occupancy give up, and that momentum you know, built over the course of the year.So, I think that and which is really helping us this year as we carry a lot of that momentum that baked in, if you will, into 2020. We do think that as a result of some of the supply issues in a number of markets that our lease over lease pricing, if you will, the more current pricing that’s occurring in 2020 will be off a little bit from the trends that we saw in 2019, but a combination of the, you know, the carry forward that we have from last year and the, you know, the plans that we have this year still offer up you know, a blended lease over lease pricing performance for 2020 at 3.4%.So, you know, we think you know that’s off a little bit from last year, but 3.4% of blended pricing performance in 2020 in the face of some of the supply pressures that we see on these markets, we feel pretty good about that actually. And still a strong occupancy that we think will capture as well. So, you know, I think these markets continue to show resiliency because of the strong demand in our portfolio in particular, because of the diversified nature of the markets that we’re in.
Al Campbell: I’ll just add to give the how that’s slated into our projections to support that what Eric was saying is, all quarters and this year is going to be a little more stable just because of where we are. And all quarters are sort of in that 3.5% to 4% revenue range for the year and so second and third quarter maybe a little bit higher, but it’s – there all in that range much more stable.
Eric Bolton: I’ll add one point even though that blended pricing is a little bit lower in ‘20 as the smart home and the bulk internet start to take hold, it helps the back half of the year a little more than certainly the first half.
Rich Anderson: Okay, great, thanks. In terms of the external growth sort of projections for this year obviously more on the acquisitions. How much of that is sort of just pre-purchase opportunity? And how much of that is cost to capital that’s making deals work a bit more easily in 2020 versus previous years?
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean, we think that it’s more likely than not that the vast majority of the acquisitions that we do will be some pre-purchases of things to be built. We may – particularly as you get towards the back half of the year, we see the opportunity set improve a little bit for buying lease-up deals as we get closer to a year end and developers or owners get a little bit more motivated, get some things done.But, you know, certainly, you know, our cost to capital has improved and it does at the margin, generate a little bit more flexibility in this regard. But at the end of the day, I mean, we’re really driven by, you know, can we deploy the capital and create a stabilized yield on that investment, that’s going to be accretive to our existing earnings profile. And that’s what really drives our mindset.We pay attention obviously to our cost to capital, but just the idea that you know that there is all of a sudden, a better spread opportunity in and of itself is not what compels us to go out and start putting money to work. We want to be sure we’re adding earning assets they’re going to be accretive to the existing earnings profile of the company.
Rich Anderson: So declining cost to capital doesn’t mean you know, you’re willing to take a lower yield or does it influence your underwriting?
Eric Bolton: No, it really doesn’t. We – we do not want to, you know, begin to just take on a bunch of lower yielding investments, just simply because the cost to capital is adjusted as it has. We’re trying to compile a long-term earnings growth profile for the company and we’re trying to protect that long-term earnings growth profile, and just adding a bunch of low-earning investments, because our cost to capital happens to be where it is, you know, really runs counter to that long-term objective.
Rich Anderson: Well, and you say lower cap rates sometimes lead to higher growth in the second year of ownership, but that’s just and I think another observation. Anyway, last question for me, I appreciate the positive wrap or you’re putting around the supply, which you know, it makes sense to me in terms of premium relative to where your rents are, but clearly it rather not be the case, right? I mean, this is making the best of a not so great situation from a supply perspective, with concessions that can be offered newer product and a strong job market, people might have a willingness to you know, to entertain optionality. So in your mind, while you see some opportunity out of the supply picture, what is the risk though, that this could you know, actually have be more damaging when you consider that the health of job markets in your you know, neck of the woods?
Eric Bolton: Well, certainly, I think the supply picture and the supply pressure, you know, as – and talked about, it does create some short-term pressure and as evidenced in our guidance. I mean, we assume that our lease over lease pricing in 2020 on a blended basis runs about 100 basis points below 2019. So there’s no question that you get into these heavier supply scenarios, particularly where there’s leasing concessions coming into the market, that there are some short-term pressure generated.And as I mentioned, that can vary quite a bit by market and in a bigger market like a Dallas, you know, you’re going to see more pressure than you are in a smaller market like a Greenville, South Carolina and that’s why we tend to be very focused in our efforts to deploy capital across the region in both large and secondary markets in an effort to something you’ll remember, Rich in an effort to get our full cycle performance profile that we’re after.So you know, I certainly acknowledge and we do that there is going to be some near-term pressure from some of the supply we’ve got that dialed in, we think appropriately into our guidance. But I will tell you, the fact that there’s a lot of this new high price product that’s coming into our locations. We think that long-term that’s a good thing, it says good things about our neighborhoods, it says good things about the value of the real estate in those neighborhoods, and it creates the opportunities that we alluded to, to continue over the next few years to get some not only good rent growth because of the improvement we’re making in the assets, but also great returns on our capital. This is the most accretive use of money that we have right now as this redevelopment initiatives. So, you know, yeah, we’ll deal with a little short-term pressure, but the long-term value play is pretty darn attractive.
Rich Anderson: Got you. Thanks, Eric. Thanks, team.
Eric Bolton: You bet.
Tim Argo: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll move next to Drew Babin with Baird. Your line is open.
Drew Babin: Good morning. A quick follow-on question to Rob’s question earlier on the Texas tax revenue caps. It sounds to me like that is not baked into your same-store expense guidance range at all. It seems like you know, maybe a longer-term benefit. Is that true or is there any kind of directional benefit that’s beginning to influence guidance there?
Al Campbell: No I mean I think we dial in what we think it’s going to be our best estimate at this point, Drew I mean, you know, the cap is not at a taxpayer level, it is at the market level and so I think there still some things to be worked out exactly how that’s going to play to each individual asset, the valuation and the millage rates that in the year for all of the markets.So we dial in what we think it’s going to be and I think – what we would say is, over time, hopefully those walls are helpful in restraining the – perhaps the rows of taxes in Texas, and that’s hard to say taxes in Texas, but, but I think in the short-term is yet to be seen exactly what it’s going to play out and it’s the best when we put our best estimate on that.
Drew Babin: Okay, and one follow-up on the same-store revenue build up, the blended leasing spreads from ’19, blended leasing spread in guidance, marrying that with the occupancy guide and Double Play impact it would seem like the revenue build up goes towards the high end of guidance, which I would surmise, there’s maybe some other ancillary type items that may be a little flattered and dragging on that which you know, that was a trend kind of throughout 2019 as well. Can you talk about what kind of the growth in other, aside from the Double Play? What was that other income growth in ‘19? What will it be in ‘20? And is there anything going on in that to kind of drive new other income you know, in the 2021, anything else you’re kind of doing?
Al Campbell: I think the easiest way to do that, quickest way to maybe, Drew is to just say talk about what our growth would have been, our guidance would have been without assuming the bulk internet program this year. And we would have had, you know, mid quarter range somewhere around 3.2% growth revenues, 3.6% for operating expenses, and 3% for NOI and then so you have the bulk internet program on top of that.And so – so that can kind of help beat on. I think the 3.2% on revenue is a combination of the rents that we put on the table this year. The 3.4% blended lease that we expect to get combined with what we did last year, that’s helpful, giving up a little bit on occupancy, 15 basis points or so.Then the other fee income items other than the bulk internet you know, the reimbursement items and trash test fee, other items they’re effectively flat with last year essentially, which, you know, your growth rate would move a little bit, get you down to that 3.2% expectation for the year. And then on expenses, we talked about 3.6% and really everything but real estate taxes would have been about 3%. So I hope that’s helpful and gives you what you’re looking for.
Drew Babin: Okay, and it sounds like the Double Play program is being implemented kind of fairly rapidly and so the benefits will be kind of mostly in 2020. Is there anything else you’re doing on the other income side that might help ‘21 kind of coming off of that ‘20 comp, any other additional you know apartment fees, things like that anything else kind of in the hopper that’s being worked on or the technology element, you know, might that move the needle as well?
Eric Bolton: Well I would tell you that a lot of the Double Play, I mean, we’re going to roll it out over the course first half this year, but I really think the full year benefit will be more next year.
Tom Grimes: It’s about half this year and half next year, because while we deploy it, and will be deployed in May, residents have to sign up for when they do on lease and renewal.
Eric Bolton: I think that that’s going to build up over this year and we’ll see more benefit in 2021. The other thing, though, that Al alluded to, and we talked about here is this repositioning effort that we’re doing with Double Play and with the more enhanced amenity upgrades. What’s happening is we’re investing a lot of that capital this year, this calendar year 2020 in the real rent growth that fund that will actually emerge in 2021. So that’s really what’s a play here. A lot of that benefit will play out next year, not this year.
Drew Babin: Okay, that’s all very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Rick Skidmore: Good morning. Thank you. Eric, you mentioned in your prepared comments some new initiatives in 2020, perhaps I missed the number, but can you – perhaps speak to what those new initiatives are that you’re focused on in 2020?
Eric Bolton: Well, you know, Tom can jump in here. I mean, it’s – now it’s bulk – Double Play initiative, the high speed internet program that we’re rolling out was what I was referencing, we got the more the smart home technology implementation that we’re going to be rolling out this year.And then as I was just mentioning, we’ve got some repositioning opportunities with some of the legacy post assets that will be rolling out this year, and are working on this year, and as I was just mentioning, you know, and then as Tom alluded to, there’s some other new technologies, the AI chat, some other things that were, you know, self-touring and other things that we’ll be testing out later this year. We don’t really expect any impact this year, but we’re going to continue to evaluate those programs for possible implementation in 2021.
Rick Skidmore: Great, thank you.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Rick.
Operator: And we’ll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Hey, thanks. Maybe just a follow-up to your response to Drew’s question. So it sounds like if the rollout for the Double Play internet goes as expected, the NOI contribution or the NOI lift in 2021 is greater than the 50 bps in 2020? Is that accurate?
Al Campbell: More comparable, I would say. I mean, we’re rolling out, there’s two phases of program, two major providers that we’re doing it in 2020, you know, we’ll have a full layer of one of those providers building the second one. So I would say probably something – it wouldn’t increase, it might be something comparable.
Eric Bolton: Yeah, I think equal, maybe slightly a little less since we’ve got the biggest provider in line now and we’re working on the rest of the portfolio.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And then Tom, listening to your comments on which markets do you think will lead the pack and which markets may lag? Is it a fair read that your – as an aggregate the smaller or secondary markets will be below average in terms of same-store revenue growth?
Tom Grimes: I don’t – well I don’t have them split exactly that way. But we’ve got you know, some encouraging places on both sides of that – on both sides of that equation. So I think we are probably the runaway leaders are Phoenix and Raleigh but I’ll tell you Birmingham, Huntsville and play – and Memphis have been pretty solid players for us and we would expect that to continue.
John Pawlowski: Okay, and then final one for me if I could sneak it in there. DC revenue growth has been accelerating nicely for you – for you last few quarters and then slowed meaningfully this quarter. So is there anything idiosyncratic this quarter that hit the DC market or the fundamental slowing in your eyes in the market?
Tom Grimes: We don’t believe the fundamentals are slowing. It’s really a comparison between the prior year, the two quarters. So last quarter – in the third quarter, we had a 30 basis point occupancy comparison tailwind that juiced revenues a little bit. And this quarter in the fourth quarter of ’18 we were at 96.6%, and we’re 96% this go around. So we had a 60 basis point headwind.
John Pawlowski: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our final question today from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.
Aaron Wolf: Hey guys, good morning. This is Aaron Wolf for John. Two quick questions. Can you provide any detail on the price per unit on the Greenville asset that you recently acquired and also on the Little Rock, Arkansas portfolio?
Brad Hill: Yeah, so this is Brad here. Let me get the details of that up in front of me. So the price per unit on the Greenville deal. Excuse me. Want to make sure I get you the right number there. So that was [268,000] [ph] a unit for the Greenville deal, which as we said a moment ago was a 5.1% cap rate on that asset. And then I’m sorry, your second question?
Aaron Wolf: Little Rock. Little Rock.
Brad Hill: Yeah, so our Little Rock assets we sold, the total price there was just under [150,000] [ph] [technical difficulty] it was 109,000 a unit.
Aaron Wolf: Okay, great. Thank you. And one last helpful and one last for me you may have disclosed this already. I apologize if you did, but the average share price on the ATM activity in the quarter?
Al Campbell: You can get from the press release, the proceeds and the shares that’s around $136 a share I believe what that will come to.
Aaron Wolf: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Brad Hill: Thank you.
Al Campbell: Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude our Q&A session for today as well as our call. We would like to thank everyone for your participation today. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-01 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the companies will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today October 31, 2019.I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. Please go ahead.
Tim Argo: Good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Brad Hill, EVP and Head of Transactions.Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussions, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday’s earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call, will be available on our website.During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com.I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and I appreciate everyone participating in our call this morning. Performance during the important third quarter leasing season was strong with continued solid momentum in rent growth and high occupancy. Reflecting strong demand across our Sunbelt markets and the great work performed by our on-site associates, resident turnover remains at historically low levels despite lease renewal pricing that continues to run above 6%.We believe that at this point in the cycle, our best strategy remains a focus on pushing rent growth. We’re happy with the performance on rent trends and are encouraged with the momentum that we’ll carry into next calendar year.While we are currently in the process of compiling a detailed outlook surrounding the new supply pipeline in 2020 and the impact at each of our locations, at this point, we expect the elevated new supply levels will likely persist in 2020. There is simply too much capital available to developers at this point to expect any sort of meaningful pull back.However, I also believe it is unlikely that we will see new supply levels meaningfully pick up from the current trends, as rising costs among other things will keep new development from accelerating. As we finalize our property budgeting process, I’m sure we’ll have markets that will likely experience some increase in new supply next year and some markets that will experience a decline in new deliveries.We will have more to report on our specific expectations for 2020 when releasing fourth quarter results, but at this point, we do not have any heightened concerns surrounding next year’s leasing environment. And while new supply remains elevated, we continue to see strong demand fueled by job growth across our markets with growing population shifts and increased migration to the Sunbelt.We closed on the disposition of a property located in the Little Rock, Arkansas market during October and expect to close on the sale of the four remaining properties in that market before year-end. Based on current contract pricing, we expect to capture a 5.4% cap rate on this portfolio of properties that has an average age of 21 years.We’re currently negotiating several one-off property acquisitions and are hopeful that we will close on one or more of these deals by year-end. As has been the case over the past few years, each of the opportunities we are underwriting are new properties in initial lease-up. The acquisition market remains very competitive, but we continue to see a high volume of lease-up transactions and expect that we will have some success with acquisitions over the next few months.As noted in our supplemental schedules to the earning release, we now have six new development projects underway and expect to start an additional two projects, located in Orlando and Houston before year-end.And finally, we continue to capture great performance out of our redevelopment pipeline. In addition to our very earnings accretive unit-interior upgrade program, we are planning to initiate in calendar year 2020 more extensive redevelopment efforts at several of the legacy Post property locations. We believe our expanding focus on redevelopment initiatives will generate very accretive returns on capital and further boost earnings growth from our existing asset base over the next few years.I want to send a big thank you to our team of associates for their work and great results over the busy summer leasing season. We are building positive momentum across multiple fronts of our platform, and I appreciate all the hard work and great progress.I’ll turn it over to Tom now.
Thomas Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our operating performance for the third quarter was strong and exceeded our expectations. With the steady demand for apartments and our enhanced platform, we have continued momentum in rent growth, strong average daily occupancy and improving trends.Same-store effective rent growth per unit was 3.9% for the quarter. This is the result – this is the sixth straight quarter of year-over-year improving ERU growth. As a result, our year-over-year same-store revenue growth was 4%, the highest it’s been since 2016.Revenue also increased 200 basis points sequentially. The acceleration in revenues was widespread across our markets. The year-over-year revenue growth rate for the third quarter exceeded the year-over-year growth rate in the second quarter in 16 of our 21 markets.Revenue performance was led by steady momentum in blended new and renewal lease pricing, up 4.9% for the quarter, which is 190 basis points better than this time last year. The improvement in blended pricing seen in Atlanta, Austin, Nashville and Dallas was particularly impactful.In addition to the great traction in blended lease over lease pricing, average daily occupancy during the quarter remained strong at 96.1%. Same-store operating expenses were in line with our guidance, but higher than they have been recently. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we have captured the benefits of the improved expense management platform on the Post portfolio, the comparisons are now more normalized and year-to-date expense growth is now 3%.As a reminder, our annual operating expense growth since 2012 has been just 2.4%, well below the sector average. This is reflective of our long-term focus on driving efficiencies into our operation. The favorable same-store trends continued into October. As we have discussed, we feel that in this part of the cycle when demand is strong we should prioritize rent growth over higher occupancy.Average daily occupancy for the month was strong at 95.6%, as compared to 96.1% in October of last year. October’s blended lease over lease rents are up 4% month-to-date, which is well ahead of the 2.2% blended rent growth posted in October of last year and will support continued momentum in effective rent growth for the portfolio, which is important for steady and sustained revenue growth.On the redevelopment front, in the third quarter, we completed 2,700 units, which keeps us on track to redevelop about 8,000 units for 2019. This is one of the best uses of capital. On average, year-to-date, we spent $5,700 per unit and achieved an additional 10% in rent, generating a year one cash on cash return in excess of 20%. Our total redevelopment pipeline now stands in the neighborhood of 14,000 to 15,000 units.Our technology platform continues to expand. Our overhauled operating system and new website have aided our ability to attract, engage and create value for our residents. The results are evident in our blended pricing traction. Our test on smart homes are going well. The technology has been installed at 15 communities with minimum disruption and has been well received by our residents.We are also exploring a range of AI, Chat, Customer Resource Management and prospect engagement tools. Our teams have handled the busy season very well and have us well positioned to move forward. We are pleased to have the integration work of 2017 and 2018 in the rear view mirror. We are encouraged with the momentum in rent growth and excited about the opportunities ahead. Al?
Albert Campbell: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I’ll provide some brief commentary on the company’s third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity, and then finally on our updated guidance for the remainder of the year.Reported FFO per share of $1.72 for the third quarter included a couple of significant non-core items outlined in the release, which added $0.16 per share of non-cash earnings to FFO. Excluding these items, FFO for the quarter was $1.56 per share, which was $0.01 per share above the mid-point of our guidance and analyst consensus. This outperformance was primarily the result of continued favorable pricing trends, as outlined by Tom, which produced the acceleration in total revenue growth for the quarter.Overall, operating expenses also remained well under control with real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expense producing the primary areas of pressure for the quarter. These were partially offset by reductions in marketing and a moderation in personnel costs.We expect real estate taxes to continue producing some expense pressure for the year, as aggressive final valuations received in certain markets will produce growth in the top end of our range outlined for the full-year. Repair and maintenance expenses for the third quarter were impacted by difficult prior year comparisons, but are projected to increase in range of 3.25% to 3.5% for the full-year.We continued to make progress on our development and lease-up portfolio during the quarter, funding $31 million towards the completion of our current pipeline. This brings our year-to-date funding to $72 million, with $125 million to $150 million total funding projected for the full-year.During the third quarter, we were fairly active on the financing front. We reopened the bond series initially issued in February to issue an additional $250 million of unsecured notes at an effective interest rate of 2.9% over the remaining term of about 10 years.We used the proceeds to payoff a $150 million variable rate term loan, which was due early next year, utilizing this low rate environment to fix more and to extend the maturity of our debt portfolio, which is seven years on average. The remaining proceeds were used to pay down our line of credit at the end of the year – at the end of the quarter, excuse me.Finally, we are increasing both our FFO and same-store guidance for the full-year to reflect the strong third quarter performance. We’re now projecting FFO per share for the full-year to be in a range of $6.46 to $6.54 per share, or $6.50 at the midpoint, which includes the $0.16 of third quarter favorable non-core items and $0.02 per share related to the fourth quarter land sale gain mentioned in the release.Our updated fourth quarter guidance assumes no further impact from the preferred share valuation or activity from the unconsolidated affiliate. We are now projecting our same-store revenues, expenses, and NOI to all grow in the range of 3% to 3.5% for the full-year, which produces a 25 basis points increase in our our same-store NOI expectations for the full-year at the mid-point. This adds about an additional $0.02 per share to the full-year FFO, Q3 and Q4 combined, which is partially offset by a $0.01 per share reduction for the year related to G&A and interest expense changes combined.That’s all we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Chris, we’ll now turn the call back to you for questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Trent Trujillo from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Trent Trujillo: Hi, good morning. So just looking at your blended lease rate growth, it was 4.9% for the quarter, down a little bit from the intra-quarter update in August. So there was some seasonal slowdown in September. It sounds like you’re continuing to focus on rate growth over occupancy, and it sounds like demand has held up well.So do you – but do you expect some level of moderation for the rest of the quarter? And mainly asking, because you’re starting to lap some of the improvements from the legacy Post portfolio. So it’s a more difficult comps ahead. What kind of trajectory do you see from here?
Eric Bolton: Yes. Trent, I would expect it to moderate seasonally. But with October, we were 180 basis points better than last year. I would still expect us to run with a reasonable cushion over prior year’s blended pricing, but you will see it moderate just as seasonal demand patterns come down.
Albert Campbell: And that’s primarily on new lease right rents. On renewal pricing, it continues to hold up pretty strong about 6%, correct.
Trent Trujillo: Okay. Thank you. And then on the Arkansas disposition, I guess, on the transaction market, the Arkansas disposition you pointed to roughly a 5.5% cap last quarter, maybe 5.4% you just cited in the prepared remarks is within the realm of that. But are you seeing improved pricing for assets, such as those that you’re seeking to sell? And does that at all inspire you to look at additional potential dispositions, if you can get good pricing on older assets that maybe need higher levels of CapEx?
Eric Bolton: Yes, Trent, this is Eric. I’ll let Brad talk about cap rates a little bit. But I would tell you on your point about dispositions broadly. We believe very much in the importance of cycling out of some of our investments every year. And we had targeted earlier this year to pull the trigger on this Little Rock portfolio and that’s what’s happening. And I’m sure, as we go into next year, we’ll have something similar that will tee up.We don’t have any significant need or desire to do anything bigger than that. It really is just part of a normal discipline to continue to look at our – the yield we’re getting off our existing portfolio and always look to pull off the bottom, if you will, every year, a little bit of the capital that, that we have invested in assets are unlikely to create go-forward performance that is as compelling as alternatives. And so we’ll just stick to that discipline as we head into next year, but nothing more significant than that. Brad do you want to?
Bradley Hill: Yes, yes. So, Trent, this is Brad. Just to give you a little bit of insight into, what we’re seeing in the transaction market. Certainly Little Rock is a smaller market within our Sunbelt focus and it’s certainly indicative of the demand for assets within our footprint. We had over 25 different buyers bid on those assets, which were all completely qualified buyers for those. So we were certainly excited about the participation that we had there.Cap rates in our markets continue to be very strong. And I think, we’re certainly seeing that in Little Rock, which is certainly a smaller market for us. But the demand for those assets is extremely strong, and we don’t see anything changing that going forward.
Trent Trujillo: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Maybe just following up on Trent’s first question. In terms of blended lease rate growth, is the guidance increase based only on better than expected third quarter results, or is there an improvement to the fourth quarter as well versus what you previously expected?
Albert Campbell: Nick, this is Al. We, as you look at the full-year, of course, our guidance is for 4.25% blended. Obviously, that’s coming off of what we saw in the third quarter, so that’s planned, but seasonally we do expect something different for the fourth quarter. To Tom’s point earlier, we still expect a pretty healthy over the prior year in terms of quarter-over-quarter growth. So we seasonally will come down, but still have a strong position.
Thomas Grimes: I’ll add one point to that, Nick. We’ve been running about 200 basis points better than last year. So far this year, we’re forecasting closer to 100 basis point spread in Q4 just as those comps have gotten a little bit tougher as we start to see that pricing power late 2018.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then what was new and renewal lease rate growth for the third quarter?
Eric Bolton: Nick, for the third quarter, new and lease – new was 2.7%, renewal was 7%, which gives us 4.9%.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just finally, I know they’re smaller markets, but what’s driving the strength in revenue growth in Birmingham and Huntsville?
Eric Bolton: Birmingham and Huntsville – in Huntsville running for two years has really been on a strong job growth trajectory, primarily driven by aerospace and tech. It is a quiet little pocket of Northwest – Northeast Alabama that is – that’s just been doing very well. And if you look back through the quarters in the last two years, you’ll see that strength has been there. And then Birmingham has just picked up a little bit with the job growth during the year, along with a little less supply. It’s been a good spot for us as well.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning, everybody. I was wondering if you could provide a breakout of the year-to-date lease-over-lease pricing for the legacy MAA portfolio versus the Post portfolio?
Eric Bolton: I can give you a quarter-to-date real quickly. And that would be for the new lease – for blended, it’s 3.8% for Post and 5.3% for Mid-America, significant improvement on the Post side.
Albert Campbell: Pretty similar year-to-date, 5.1% MAA and 3.8% Post, for blended.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks, guys. And then, so next year really is the first year that you’ll have a full-year of Post renovations hitting that renewal period. I’m just wondering how you’re thinking about the potential increases on those renovated units after the – that first, I guess, renewal versus a non-renovated asset?
Thomas Grimes: No. The renovate on a renewal basis, it really come in at very similar levels. There’s almost no delta between that, because that’s a new resident coming in. So it’s not like the old resident got the renewal bump and then the improvement. So we’ve seen real consistency on the renewal front. That’s held up quite well this year across the portfolio in both A, B, as well as Post and MAA…
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it.
Eric Bolton: …in renovated and non renovated.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yes, understood. And then just last one, can you remind us of the increases that you’re targeting on the smart home investments? And what you expect that contribution to be the same-store revenue as you roll into 2020 versus the contribution in 2019?
Thomas Grimes: So we’re in the process of planning that at this point. I mean, we’ve got early test that give us hope the by market we’ll be able to get a good bump on the revenue enhancement side, but really haven’t nailed that down as it comes to implementation and forecast for 2020 and then there are also some expense savings to consider in that equation.
Albert Campbell: And this – Austin, this is Al, I’ll just add. We certainly would expect that to grow towards the back of the year. So certainly, very minimal impact in the first-half of the year with a little bit more in the back-half, as we roll this out, as Tom mentioned.
Thomas Grimes: Right.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Zachary Silverberg: Hi, it’s Zachary Silverberg here for Haendel. You guys have delevered from five times to four, seven over the past year. Where do you see your optimal leverage level at this point in the cycle? And what is your view on using more leverage to acquire assets, given the low cap rate environment?
Albert Campbell: Well, I’ll start with that, and we feel pretty good about where our leverage is. We worked very hard over the last year several years to bring it down. Right now, we’re about 32% debt to gross assets, as you said, high 4s and debt to EBITDA is a very good place to be, particularly given the low risk or lower competitive risk of our strategy. So we don’t seem to need to do anything significantly different in that.As we look at our plans over the next year or so, we also don’t see a huge need for marginal capital we have. And when you look at our acquisition plans or development funding and asset sales that we expect to do combine with the internal free cash flow that we do, it’s a pretty leverage neutral plan at this point.So we like where our leverage is, no need to do anything significant really, either way the other, but we are very happy to your point, we have a lot of capacity, we have a billion-dollar credit facility. If things do change and there are opportunities to jump out, we certainly – that’s one option that we could use to fund that. And so feel very good about that and we could put significant amount of assets on our balance sheet pretty quickly and not do harm to our revenue.
Eric Bolton: And I also point out one of the other things that’s worth noting is, while the leverage has dome down, the cost has come down, the duration has moved out and our duration on our debt portfolio now is longer than it is out beyond anything we’ve ever had in our 25 years. So it’s approaching as around seven years, little over seven years. So we’re pretty pleased with where that’s gotten to.
Zachary Silverberg: And on the development front, just seen two development starts this quarter was the projected yield or IRR. And how do you guys – are you guys inclined to ramp up development to a more significant level? And do you see any potential opportunities in the market?
Eric Bolton: Well, right now, I mean, the two new deals will start between now and year-end in addition to what we already have listed in supplemental. These are going to be stabilized yields north of 6% – 6% to 6.5% is where we still believe we’re going to end out in terms of stabilized NOI yields.We’re – we believe that, we’re pretty comfortable carrying 3% to 4% of enterprise value in terms of the development pipeline, which puts our number somewhere kind of the $500 million to $700 million range. That’s about as far as we think we’ll take it at any point in time. But we’re pretty comfortable with what we have right now. And obviously, if those kind of yields, it’s still pretty attractive.
Zachary Silverberg: Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. Eric, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned a more extensive redevelopment program next year. Can you elaborate on that at all? Will the unit – number of units you’re redeveloping increase versus what you’ve done historically? And also, what the dollar amount, will that change versus 2019?
Eric Bolton: Well, I’ll start and then Tom can add any details. I mean, we will continue with the redevelopment. When I make reference to that, I’m really referring to the kitchen and bath upgrade initiative unit interiors, if you will. And that program will continue next years, as we’ve been doing for the past number of years.What’s going to be different is, we are stepping up more extensive repositioning efforts at some of the legacy Post locations. We have portfolio of about 10 properties that we’ve initially identified that we believe offer superior location value. And given all the new supply that’s come in around some of these locations at much, much higher rent levels, we see a real opportunity to go in and do a more extensive amenity upgrades and some other repositioning CapEx spend that we think really elevates the property to a completely different price point.And the market certainly offers that, that opportunity. We think based on what we see happening around these locations. And so in aggregate, that’s about – we think it will be roughly about $20 million spend next year that will – we will work on that over the course of next year and really begin to harvest the opportunity from that in terms of rent growth and revenues in 2021 and beyond.But that was one of the real aspects of this merger with Post that we were very drawn to was great real estate in great locations that has only gotten better as a consequence a lot of this new supply that’s coming to the market.
John Kim: For those 10 properties be taken offline or would they remain in the same-store pool?
Thomas Grimes: No. John, we – we’ve done these kind of repositions in – on assets before. And what we found is the level of disruption for the exterior work is really minor and it allows us to do the work around the resident. We’re not forcing turnover in this case and most of these were already underway on the kitchen and bath. So it stays in the same-store.
John Kim: Okay. It sounds like you’re not that concerned about supply next year, but I’m wondering what you may be concerned about on the demand side. It looks like the homeownership rates ticked up in the third quarter nationally and obviously, we have more attractive mortgage rates. So can you comment on what you’ve seen as far as move-outs to homeownership? And anything else on the demand side that you think maybe?
Eric Bolton: Well, we haven’t really seen any changes of note on the demand side. It continues to be quite strong. Our move-outs due to home buying, move-outs to home renting have been very consistent now for the past two or three years and we haven’t really seen any change in behavior. We continue to not be worried about single family either as a for-sale or for a for-rent product. I think that we’re just in a completely sort of different mindset now as it relates to how people approach the housing.Having said that, the – you’re right. We’re not particularly nervous about supply picture next year. To me, the thing I’m more nervous about long-term is to what degree is this job growth or their broader economy begin to slowdown due to various factors that we all read about. And I think that, obviously, with employment levels being as robust as they are right now, there’s more risk to job growth moderating than there is accelerating from where we are right now.So, it’s something we’re going to continue to watch and monitor. I will say this – that on a – from a regional perspective, we continue to believe if you want to begin to dial in expectations regarding a recession or expectations regarding a slowdown in the broader employment markets, we continue to believe that these Sunbelt markets will hold up better than most other regions of the country and for all the reasons that you know regarding affordability and just the favorable employment picture that we think continues to fuel growth in the Southeast will – in a recession, we all sort of suffer a little bit. But in a recession, I would tell you that, our regions in the country, we believe, on the demand side of the equation holds up a lot better than other regions of the country.
John Kim: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Wes Golladay from RBC capital markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hey, good morning, guys. If we were to make the assumption that job growth will be at least comparable to this year, when we look to next year, would you assume the strategy would be to remain push rate over occupancy?
Eric Bolton: Yes, we do. We think at this point in the cycle that, that’s the thing to do. I think the thing you have to appreciate at least the way we look at it is the variables that really drives revenue over time better or more so than any other variable is rent growth. And we think when you can get rent growth, you better get it. And even if that comes at the expense of a little short-term pressure regarding higher vacancy from a year-over-year perspective, we think that’s the right trade-off to make. And so at this point in the cycle, that’s exactly what we’re doing.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then looking at developments, it looks like you started one in Orlando this quarter, you’re going to start one next quarter in Orlando. Is that more of a high-conviction call on Orlando, or is that just where the opportunities are falling right now?
Eric Bolton: It just happens to be two opportunities that fell our way. One is, we’re self developing in Downtown Orlando, which is the one that is noted in the supplemental. And then the other opportunity is in – more in a suburban location. It’s with a developer, we’ve got, it’s really a pre-purchase of something that’s not – that the developer is going to build for us, if you will, and we’re structuring it initially as a JV. They’ll build it out. And then upon stabilization, we’ll take them out. So it just happen to be, I mean, we like Orlando a lot and continue to feel very good about the prospects of that market long-term, but just happens to be – with these two opportunities popped up.
Wes Golladay: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Drew Babin from Baird. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: Hey, good morning.
Eric Bolton: Good morning, Drew.
Drew Babin: A quick question. It was good to see revenue growth kind of accelerate sequentially in Charlotte. And I guess, going to the other kind of Post Legacy heavy markets, Atlanta and Dallas, I think, you mentioned the leasing spreads were pretty strong in the third quarter, both of those. Are we at the point where we might really see those markets take a sharper acceleration into next year? And I guess, how should we think about how some of the CapEx plans you’re talking about, how do they kind of fit in and might they kind of throw some fuel on that fire in the next year?
Thomas Grimes: Yes. The – I mean, really what I hit on through is sort of the current momentum. And I would expect to see Atlanta, Austin and Nashville continue to improve based on what we’ve done thus far. And then Dallas is a place that is improving, but it’ll run a little bit weaker than its peers right now. The additional redevelopment that we touched on earlier, the repositioning of the – amenity packages in the exterior of the building, that benefit will really come in 2020 – excuse me, 2021.
Drew Babin: And those exterior renovations, you’re mentioning that in the context of Dallas?
Thomas Grimes: Yes. Three are – those – the 10 properties we’re looking at. There are a couple in Dallas.
Drew Babin: Okay.
Thomas Grimes: And they spread across the footprint, though. But primarily, as Eric mentioned in the Post portfolio.
Drew Babin: Okay, thanks for that. And then the retail acquisition made in the quarter at one of your existing properties, what was the size of that? I didn’t see an amount in there. Is it relatively nominal in terms of the the amount spent?
Thomas Grimes: Yes. It was pretty small. It was 14,000 feet. So acquisition there. It’s really ground floor retail of an asset that we currently own that we just feel that it’s better to own and control the retail of assets it’s on the ground floor. So yes, it’s pretty small.
Drew Babin: Okay. And the last one for me. Al, on the balance sheet, I know this was asked in a different way earlier. The leverage ratio where it is, is it where it is, because that’s exactly where you want it to be, or is it where it is, because it’s become very difficult to acquire properties in your market? And there’s obviously still going to be assets like Little Rock that make sense for disposition.Do you – might we see that leverage ratio tick up at the margin a little bit next year with redevelopment, development type needs? Is that something that you’re okay with?
Albert Campbell: Well, honestly, first of all, we hope we have the opportunity to invest in very high-quality investments that do need additional capital and leverage. We certainly comfortable with that if we need to. I would say, we’re comfortable where it is. We feel like we have good access to capital in all pieces of capital driven. So we will look to protect.So we’re in that range, but know that we have the flexibility to add to that leverage early sizable amount if necessary and available to have good use for it. So we built that flexibility to have it for our business plans. We’re not – we have protected, but use it when necessary.
Drew Babin: Great. I appreciate the detail. That’s all for me.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead.
Richard Anderson: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Eric Bolton: Hi, Rich.
Albert Campbell: Good morning.
Richard Anderson: So I appreciate the pushing rent at the expense of occupancy sort of mindset in the current environment. And obviously, you’ve determined that the economics of that strategy are the best way to go. But at what point – and do you have a occupancy level in mind, where you have to kind of flip the switch back the other direction? I know you lost a little bit occupancy relative to year ago in the third quarter. Just wondering what that number is, where you say, oh, perhaps this isn’t working as well as and we have to kind of reassess?
Eric Bolton: Well, at the end of the day, Rich, it’s all about trying to manage revenue performance and optimize revenue results. And we’re trying to optimize revenue results, both near-term and long-term. And I think that if we find ourselves in a scenario where the overall revenue results are trending to a point that at lower than what we would like. And we see evidence that we are creating more turnover as a consequence of being too aggressive with our rent practices, particularly on renewals. Then it’s an easy call to make at that point to back off a little bit on the prioritization of rent growth and call back some of the occupancy in – again, in order to protect an overall revenue result that we’re after.But I would tell you that, again, as I’ve mentioned earlier, I think that the variable that drives revenue results and value over the long haul is rent growth. And it’s very easy to get consumed by the sugar high of year-over-year gain in occupancy to boost revenues. And while you’re enjoying that short-term phenomenon, you are giving up long-term performance opportunity.And so I think it’s a trade-off that you have to be very thoughtful about. And right now, we think the right thing to do is protect longer-term revenue performance through gaining as much rent growth as we can and tolerate a little give up on current opportunity on revenues through higher vacancy.
Richard Anderson: Okay, great. And speaking of the renewal 7%, I think you said in October. I might have missed that, but I think it’s in the range. That’s kind of way above the average relative to your peers by perhaps a significant amount. Is that achievable in the future? Where is that coming from? Is it tied in with the Post merger, or where – is that – or is that a natural level of renewal activity that you think is something you can repeat for the foreseeable future?
Eric Bolton: Rich, I’ll tell you, 6% to 6.5% has been pretty natural and steady win. Thank you. When we did the first set of renewals on Post, we got a bump. But we’re a long over with our pricing system on platform in place on that property. And so that is a fairly consistent number across the property in 6%, 6.5%. We’re excited with 7% or 7.2% in October, certainly won’t promise that to you going forward.But we’re at a point, where people appreciate where they’re living, where our resident or where our teams are taking very good care of the residents. There is hesitancy to move and it’s a pain to move. And as long as we create value for folks, housing markets are getting more expensive everywhere. We’re able to put through a fare increase and we’ve been able to do that pretty consistently.
Richard Anderson: Yes, I just moved too, it is a pain. And then the last question, perhaps, Eric, your cost of capital today is at a level you haven’t seen before, probably in the history of your company, both on an absolute and relative basis premium to NAV and a cash flow multiple that is very much comparable to your peers, which hasn’t always been the case in history.How is that changing your approach to external growth? I know you said you think you will have some opportunities to acquire some lease-up assets in the near-term. But is your narrative changing from an external growth standpoint, or are you kind of applying the same process and just considering this cost of capital decline is icing on the cake?
Eric Bolton: No, I mean I think that to a large degree, it – our approach and our thoughts about deploying capital remain consistent with what we’ve always done. I mean, clearly, we think about our cost to capital as a key component to deciding can we put capital out. I will say that we like where the balance sheet is at the moment. As Al was talking about earlier, we like our leverage, we like where our capacity is on the balance sheet.And having said that, if we find strong evidence going forward that we’re going to be able to put some more money to work than what we’ve assumed, then we will think about other forms of capital other than debt in an effort to keep the balance sheet strong We’re not going to materially weaken the balance sheet in an effort to capture growth.So we all understand that at some point, equity has to factor into the equation. And if we feel like that we can with a high degree of certainty to put that capital to work, then we wouldn’t hesitate to move in that direction. But I’m not going to go ask for capital and hope that we can put it to work. I’ve got to be very, very confident that we can put it to work.
Richard Anderson: Hey, great color. Thanks, Eric. Thanks, everyone.
Eric Bolton: You bet.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead.
John Guinee: Great. Thank you. Two questions. Your peers are spending a lot of time and effort in dollars aggressively dealing with rent control. Is the rent control show up anywhere in your markets, maybe a DC or Austin?And then the second question is, it looks like you’re building your last two most recent announced developments at about 270,000 a unit. What do you – what kind of products are you building there? Is it a wrap product or a podium or what are you building in Denver and Orlando?
Eric Bolton: Well, I’ll take the first part of the question, Brad, you can take the second. What I would tell you, John, no, we have not really seen any real evidence of rent control per se certainly nothing like what we’ve heard coming out of California and New York across our footprint.I mean, I think that the – more often than not what we see some of the local folks doing in Austin and Nashville and some places like that is talking about requiring more – being more aggressive about requiring affordability component to every new development that gets approved. So a certain percentage of the units have to be limited in terms of the rent levels relative to median income in the area and so forth.So I think that that’s where we see and the only thing that we really see suggesting efforts by local officials to keep a housing costs from getting out of hand, but no real rent control narrative that we’re aware of. Brad?
Bradley Hill: Yes, this is Brad, John. So the deal that we’re doing in Denver right now is a four-storey walk-up product. Austin, Denver, certainly are elevated from what we’ve seen in the last couple of years. But that’s a four-storey walk-up product surface park, elevator service. And then the project we were doing in Downtown Orlando, that’s a 11 storey kind of high-rise deal that we’re doing with a structured parking component.
John Guinee: You can build a 11-storey concrete with structured parking for 270,000 a unit?
Bradley Hill: Yes. So that deal we’re using kind of a different construction technique by FINFROCK, which is a design-build firm. They may have done this a number of times throughout the Florida market. And it’s really a proprietary system that those guys use and they’re able to build part of the product offsite and really bring it onsite and erect it. And it keeps the construction time period a little bit more concise, reduces the timeframe there, interest cost, things like that and then they also guaranteed the cost of it. So it’s a slightly different technique. They’ve really perfected it – keeps the cost down on that deal.
John Guinee: Interesting. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Neil Malkin from Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Neil Malkin: Good morning, guys.
Eric Bolton: Good morning.
Neil Malkin: I’m not sure if you mentioned it, but the increase in total overhead. What – was that due to, I guess, performance better than expected, or planned accruals for that or what’s that related to?
Albert Campbell: Hey Neil, this is Al. Yes, we had a slight increase for our guidance for the year there. It’s really two things. And part of it was what you mentioned, we had very good performance this year, so some of it was our incentive plans and many of our regional operating Post well deserved. And also we had some additional technology investments that we’re making this year. Certainly, both are good investments or good spends. So you saw our vision, our guidance and we feel good about that number for the full-year.
Neil Malkin: All right, great. Makes sense. Next, the demand is obviously very strong on the Sunbelt markets. But just in terms of forward demand or estimating that, do you guys track development – office development in your markets, the preleasing things like that, or do you monitor sort of relocation headquarters, relocation and things like that in order to kind of forecast what incremental demand will look like?
Eric Bolton: Yes. I mean, it’s – we certainly monitor and track corporate relocations and some of the bigger announcements to take place in some of these markets that over the next several years are going to drive demand. And it’s – that that’s a notoriously hard thing to forecast with any real certainty in terms of the job growth scenario.We really step back and look at the macro factors. And then when we look at the macro factors at a market level, whether it’d be some of the good things happening in Nashville, Austin, Raleigh and Charlotte. And so it’s – we bring together a lot of different inputs in an effort to get confident that given market is likely to see good job growth and good wage growth, both of which are important.The thing that’s really difficult to really wrap your head around is exactly when is the broader U.S. economy going to materially slowdown and moderate, i.e., predicting a recession, if you will, that becomes a little bit more of a challenge. And – but again, from our perspective, what we take a lot of comfort in is that, where we to face a broader overall U.S. economy slowdown, we continue to believe that our story focus on the Sunbelt markets, particularly diversified very well in both sort of A and B product and a more affordable product, in general, puts us in a good position for any sort of a material slowdown.And if you go back and you look at the recession or more material slowdown periods, historically, over the last 25 years, you’ll find that our store tends to hold it better and we still think that will be the case the next time it happens.
Neil Malkin: Fair enough. Last one for me. Given the – your move to push rent, does it make sense to more aggressively pursue acquisitions, particularly given the strong performance of your stock year-to-date?
Eric Bolton: Well, as I mentioned, we are looking at – actively looking at a couple of deals right now. One that we expect to have hopefully in the contract this week, we’ll see if it gets the due diligence and actually gets done. But we’re pushing. We’re pushing as hard as we feel like we should.I think that at the end of the day, it – I mean, we’re clearly thinking about the spread in terms of our cost to capital and the kind of the yield that we would get. But we’re also making sure that as we deploy capital that we’re really strengthening the earnings profile of the company going forward. So we want to be sure that we’re going to get to a point, where whatever stabilized yield we’re going to get out of whatever the new investment would be is going to be better, if you will, than the go-forward yield out of the existing portfolio.And so it’s all about just making sure that we’re adding investments that create a more robust earnings profile going forward versus the existing asset base. And we think that, given what we see happening now with just continued high levels of new lease-ups coming to market that we’re going to see a more opportunity over the coming year.
Neil Malkin: Thanks for the color.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Hi, good morning, Tom, on the same-store relative weakness in Dallas and Orlando, anything more than just a supply issue there?
Thomas Grimes: On – no, I mean, frankly, job growth is great in both places, both are leading markets. In Dallas, as I mentioned, we like the traction and the improvement and we’ve gotten on blended rents there. And on our revenue growth, which has gone from negative 2 in first quarter, negative 0.2 in the first quarter to 0.9 to 1.5 on Dallas. And then on Orlando, what we’re really seeing is the B asset class holding up quite well and a little bit of pressure on the A’s with new supply, but both have extraordinary job growth stories.
Rob Stevenson: What about Dallas? I mean, are you seeing any major bifurcation in terms of A’s versus B’s in that market?
Thomas Grimes: With Dallas, there is a split there with the product and it’s also an urban – suburban split a little bit. Uptown is a little bit tougher than the portfolio. But places like Frisco and Plano, our A product is feeling some pressure, but the B holding up reasonably well in Dallas.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And in 2020, I mean, you’ve talked a little bit about this. But in 2020, are any of your markets by your data sources or estimations likely to be seeing peak deliveries in 2020, or are we basically, has the pig mostly gone to the python in most of your markets now?
Thomas Grimes: I think early to tell on that. But, as Eric mentioned in his remarks, it’s unlikely that we see them come down materially, and it’s unlikely that we’ll see a huge ramp up. But market by market, we’re still going by the asset by asset build up of where supply is hitting scrubbing that numbers, comparing with third-party, running it through Brad’s team, too, and we’ll have more to say on that in our fourth quarter release.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Al, how significant are fees in your overall revenue number? I mean, you guys are top line $1.2 billion and change year-to-date. How much of that is fees versus just straight out rent?
Albert Campbell: Rent is about 93% of our revenue on that. And so both reimbursements and fees make up the restaurant. So fees are about half of that, so 3%, 3.5% fees. So fairly meaningful, but certainly it’s about rents.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. I mean, from from you guys’ perspective, I mean, are there still more fees that you guys can grow and add to the system or is it just inflationary growth in the existing fees? In other words, are you guys in suburban location is going to start charging for parking and other sorts of stuff to continue to drive the fees at above the average rent rate, or are we sort of settled down in terms of the fee growth in the overall composition?
Albert Campbell: Let me say something, and Tom certainly can add to this.
Thomas Grimes: Yes, I’m sure.
Albert Campbell: I think what you’ve seen in the last year or so as you’re seeing our fees, it’s kind of blocky. We have programs that are going in, have significant increase and they stay stable for a couple of years as we get to new programs to roll out. So what we’re seeing the last couple of years, Rob, is so fees have sort of grown less than rents. I would say, as we move into 2020 and 2021, Tom has got a couple of programs, assure you will talk about As we build out in 2020 and more productive in 2021, we’ll have that line of growing more in line with rents what we expect.
Thomas Grimes: Yes. I think there are a few things to do, Rob. But I mean, as Al sometimes saying is keeping the main thing, the main thing, rent is the deal and that’s going to be what drives us forward. We’ll have some opportunities on the technology front going forward, but the rents will be the driver of our business going forward in the focus.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then just one housekeeping item. I’m not sure I saw somewhere. What was the price for the Ridge at Chenal disposition? And then what type of sales price does the 4 – the 5.4% cap rate indicate for the remaining Little Rock portfolio?
Albert Campbell: The Ridge at Chenal deal, that’s about $45 million, $46 million. And as talked about, the cap rate was pretty similar to overall for the whole portfolio. All the assets together are 5.4%. I think, they’re all pretty tight on their bandwidth.
Rob Stevenson: What is the gross sales price for all of the Little Rock portfolio?
Albert Campbell: About $150 million somewhere in that range.
Rob Stevenson: Excuse me, sorry about that.
Albert Campbell: $150 million.
Rob Stevenson: Okay, perfect. Thanks guys. Have a good one.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Rob.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Tom, I wanted to go back to your renewal remarks – renewal growth remarks, just so I understand it. So in a normal course of business for this year, you would have been in the 6% to 6.5% renewal range and then the legacy Post portfolio drove you a bit higher. Is that an accurate interpretation?
Thomas Grimes: No. Sorry, John, if I give you that impression, that’s not. We just had sort of a better group. We push the renewals out at different rates for different people based on where they are in the market and what the sub-market is doing. And basically, we just had a higher accept rate at the higher price point. Post was right in there with Mid America, but just slightly lower. It is not Post driving us to 7%, it was more the accept mix during the quarter we got some of our higher asks.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Maybe then if you could give some color theories of what’s going on in the ground to lead that higher acceptance of the higher rate. So if you gave me a job and supply forecast or the actual – what actually happened in 2019 a year ago, I probably would have predicted a lower renewal rate and I did. So I’m just curious, what on the ground on the demand side is leading to that incremental lift and renewals, do you think?
Thomas Grimes: Yes. John, I can take a stab at that. My guess would have been like yours, a little bit lower than 7%. But I think, as I touched on earlier, we are – platform has substantially improved. Our teams are doing an awfully fine job of taking care of our residents. They are renewing at a higher rate. And I think part of that is because of us, but I think part of that is just because of secular changes in society today, where people are staying single longer, they’re deferring marriage, they’re deferring childbirth and thus, they’re – and our move-outs to home buying continues to drop and did again this quarter. So I think it is primarily those changes that are making the difference.
Eric Bolton: Yes. I would also add to that. John. This is Eric. That – one of the things I think you have to realize is that a lot of the supply that’s coming into our market, as you know, is pretty high-priced product, I mean, really high-priced products. And even though, there may be some temporary lease-up concessions other things done, we are competing in this new – with this new supply, I guess, a much higher price point product than we ever have in the past when we’ve seen supply pick up in years past.In prior cycles when supply picked up, it tended to be more of a balanced price point product, whereas now given all the things you know about relating to development cost and so forth, everything is just so much more higher price right now, which I think is really also fueling an ability for us to be a little bit more aggressive on renewals and still hanging onto a lot of people, because you’ve got the hassle moving.But I mean, if you’re going to incur the hassle moving, you got to really go to something that is compelling, either just a far superior product at a comparable price or even at a lower price. And that – I think that a lot of the new product doesn’t really offer that same dynamic as we’ve seen in past cycles.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And the, Brad, one quick one for you. Curious of what you saw earlier in the year when Fannie and Freddie spreads gapped out, and I know they came back down pretty quickly. But within that time period, was there any interesting bifurcation across your markets in terms of the strength of the bit intense?
Bradley Hill: No, we’ve really not seen much bifurcation, as you mentioned there at all within our markets. I think there is just so much demand out there for assets in our region. Once again, the reasons that were talked about. I think for the most part, the buyers are moving past a lot of that stuff. And we’re not seeing any type of the demand being impacted by what Fannie and Freddie are doing. It seems like there is – folks have alternative sources of capital lined up in the sense that, it’s not impacting at all.
John Pawlowski: Yep. Great. Thank you.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, John.
Operator: And it does appear there are no further questions over the phone at this time. I’d like to turn it back to the speakers for any closing remarks.
Tim Argo: We appreciate everyone being on the call this morning, and we’ll see many of you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks. So thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today August 1, 2019.I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO, Al Campbell, our CFO, Tom Grimes, our COO.Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussions, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our '34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website.During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com.I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Tim, and good morning. Second quarter results were ahead of our expectation. Strong job growth and resulting demand for apartment housing are driving higher trends in rent growth across our Sunbelt markets. We believe our portfolio, which is diversified across this region in terms of both sub-markets and price point, is particularly well-positioned to capture the benefits of these positive trends. This strong demand coupled with the benefits from our merger and the retooling of our operating platform is really starting to bear fruit as our combined lease-over-lease pricing in Q2 was a strong 5%, higher than what we've seen in several years. We're encouraged with the trends is effective rent growth continues to climb, as anticipated, and in line with our expectations.Same-store expense growth in Q2 was higher than what we've seen over the past couple of years, as we harvested expense synergies from our merger transaction, setting up a more challenging comparison for us this year. However, as has been our custom, we maintain a rigorous focus on driving efficiencies into our operation, and as you will note from yesterday's earnings release, we did revise down slightly our full year expectation for expense growth.Overall, the 3% growth in same-store NOI captured in the second quarter as well ahead of our original expectations and we're encouraged with the overall trends. Given the strong year-to-date performance and that we are well into the busy summer leasing season, we are raising our full year expectations for same-store revenues, net operating income, and overall FFO growth.On the transaction front, we've not seen much change from the past few quarters with stable cap rates and a high level of buyer appetite. We continue to see good deal flow, but the private equity buyer remains aggressive in their efforts to deploy capital. We remain committed to our investment disciplines and, as noted in our earnings guidance update, we have pulled back on the level of acquisitions we expect to complete this year while increasing the level of funding we plan to allocate to new development starts.You will note that we also increased our planned dispositions volume. Earlier this month we initiated marketing efforts with plans to sell five properties in the Little Rock, Arkansas market and we expect to exit this market by year-end.During the quarter we completed lease-up at two of our new properties in Denver. Our remaining two properties in initial lease-up located in Charleston and Atlanta remain on track and should stabilize late this year. Our five new development projects currently under construction also remain on track.At a total investment of just over $354 million, we continue to forecast stabilized NOI yields north of 6% from these two pipelines. We also continue to work on pre-development activities at our existing owned land sites in Denver Houston in Orlando. In addition, we are close to finalizing a new JV development project located in Orlando. We expect to have construction under way at all four of these new projects by year-end.Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to send a big thank you to our team of associates here at the home office, in our regional offices, and at and those associated serving at each of our properties. Our folks have done a tremendous job over the last couple of years working through the challenging process of merging and transforming two large, two long-established companies systems and operating programs. The hard work is starting to show in our results, and we look forward to capturing additional opportunity over the coming quarters. Tom?
Thomas Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. Our operating performance for the second quarter was strong and better than our original expectation, driven by strong demand and the improved platform. We have continued momentum in rent growth, strong average daily occupancy and improving trends.Same-store effective rent growth per unit was 3.2% for the quarter. This was the 5th straight quarter of improving ERU growth. As a result, our year-over-year revenue growth rate was the highest it's been since 2016 and revenues increased 130 basis points sequentially. The acceleration in revenues was widespread. The year-over-year revenue growth rate for the second quarter exceeded the growth rate of the first quarter in 19 of our 21 largest markets.As signaled by or guidance raise, we expect this acceleration to continue. This is led by steady momentum and new and renewal blended lease-over-lease pricing. Blended lease-over-lease rents for the quarter, up 5% which is a 170 basis points better than this time last year. The improvement in blended prices from Austin, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Dallas were particularly impactful. Even with the great traction on blended pricing during the quarter, average daily occupancy remained strong at 96%. Operating expenses were in line with our guidance, but higher than they have been recently.As we have mentioned on prior calls, we have captured the benefits of the improved expense management platform on the post portfolio and the comparisons are now more difficult. Year-to-date expense growth is now 2.8%. As a reminder, our annual operating expense growth since 2012 has been just 2.4%, well below the sector average. The favorable same-store trends continued into July. We're on track for another month of strong blended lease-over-lease pricing. July blended lease over lease rents were up 5.3%, which is well ahead of the 3.2% posted in July of last year.Average daily occupancy for the month continued at a strong 95.9%, which was 20 basis points higher than July of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which represents all vacant units and move-outs notices for a 60-day period is just 7.3%, which is 50 basis points better than this time last year. On the redevelopment front, through the second quarter, we completed about 3,800 units, which keeps us on track to redevelop around 8,000 units in 2019. This is one of our best uses of capital. Through the second quarter on average, we spent approximately $5,800 per unit and achieved an additional 10% in rent, which generates a year-one cash-on-cash return in excess of 20%.Our total redevelopment pipeline now stands in the neighborhood of 14,000 to 15,000 units. Our technology platform continues to expand. Our overhauled operating system in new website have aided our ability to attract, engage, and create value for our residents. The results are evident in our blended pricing traction. Our tests on smart homes are going well. The technology has been installed with minimum disruption and received well by our customers. We are also exploring a range of AI, chat, customer resource management, and prospect engagement tools. We're excited about the innovations in the apartment space and look forward to continuing to incorporate new technology into our operating platform. Our teams are pleased to have the work of 2017 and 2018 in the rear view mirror. We're encouraged with the momentum in rent growth and excited to have our transformed platform fully operational. Al?
Al Campbell: Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's second quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity, and then finally on our updated guidance for the remainder of the year. FFO per share of $1157 for the second quarter included $0.04 per share of non-cash income related to the embedded derivatives in our preferred shares. Excluding this item, FFO was $1.53 per share for the quarter, which was $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance. That performance was a result of favorable operating performance. And as Tom mentioned, primarily related to the continued strong lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter and year-to-date.Our pricing performance combined with the continued strong occupancy drove 90 basis points acceleration in total same store revenues for the quarter to 2.3% growth. This revenue performance, combined with a 3.6% growth in operating expenses for the quarter, produced NOI growth of 3%, which is the highest 9 quarters and is projected to continue growing over the remainder of the year. Additional information gain during the second quarter confirmed real estate tax pressure in Georgia, primarily Atlanta, and Texas, as we continue to work through significant valuation increases over the last couple of years. We now expect real estate tax expense growth range from 4.25 to 5.25 for the full year.Despite this increase, strong performance in overall same-store expenses in the first half of the year allowed us to slightly lower the midpoint of our expense guidance for the full year. We continue to make progress on our development lease-up portfolio during the quarter, we funded an additional $26 million toward the completion of our current development pipeline.We now have $148 million remaining to fund on the 5 projects currently under construction and we expect to fully complete two of these communities this year and as Eric mentioned, we expect to begin four new projects later this year with a total estimated cost of around $300 million. We continue to expect stabilized yields between 6% and 6.5% on our development projects, once completed and fully leased up.During the second quarter were, were fairly active on the financing front, we paid off $300 million 6-month term loan, which was due in June, and completed the renewal of our $1 billion unsecured credit facility, extending maturity until 2023. We also established our commercial paper program during the quarter to capture lower financing costs on our routine working capital borrowings. Our commercial paper borrowings will be capped $500 million and our fully backed by our credit facility.Our balance sheet remains strong. Leverage remains low with debt to total assets of 32% and total debt to EBITDA below five times. And we proactively used the low rate environment in the last few years to further protect our balance sheet. At quarter end, we had 85% of our debt fixed or hedged against rising interest rates and an average maturity of almost eight years, which is historical high for our company. We also had over $670 million of cash and funding capacity under our line of credit and our current forecast is leverage-neutral for the year.Finally, we are revising our FFO and same-store guidance for the full year to reflect a strong first half performance, as well as our updated projections for the remainder of the year. We're now projecting FFO per share for the full year to be in a range of $6.20 to $6.36 per share, or $6.28 at the midpoint, which is a $0.05 per share increase of our previous guidance, based entirely on increased operating performance.Given the volatility of interest rates, which is the primary driver of valuation changes related to our preferred shares we're projecting the favorable preferred valuation to reverse later in the year, bringing the full year impact on earnings to 0.With the continued strong pricing performance of the first half of the year, we are revising our full year guidance for same-store revenue to range of 2.75% to 3.25%, or 3% at the midpoint, which is a 70 basis points increase from our midpoint our previous guidance.And as mentioned earlier, though we expect continued pressure from real estate taxes, we project total operating expenses for the full year to now be in a range of 2.5% to 3.5%, or 3% at the midpoint. This performance will produce same-store NOI in a range of 2.5% to 3.5% or 3% at the midpoint for the full year, which is 120 basis points above our initial expectation for the year.That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments, so Aaron, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We can take our first question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning, everybody. Tom or Tim, maybe, or I'm sorry Tom or Al, you discussed that you expect continued acceleration in your markets, you highlighted July lease rates remain well above last year. Occupancy is up on a year-over-year basis, but the revised guidance assumes same-store revenue growth stabilizes at a consistent level with what you achieved in the second quarter. So can you just give us the moving pieces are or what it is you see that could drive stabilization in your same-store revenue growth in the back half of the year?
Al Campbell: I think, if we think about the forecast- this is Al, Austin, and I'll start with that and Tom can add some if he wants to. I think what we really think about it is, we're proud to see the trends that we've seen in the first half and we expect to continue to have good pricing trends, but remember we have dialed in about 20 basis points of occupancy that we will expect to give up and remaining over the back half due to continue to be aggressive on the pricing. And so I think given all that put together, and obviously we have the slower leasing season ahead of us. I think traffic will decline as we get into the 4th quarter, late 3rd and 4th quarters. I think all that together tells us that we feel like we have a good expectation in place and we feel good about that. I don't know if you have any more.
Tim Argo: Yes, I'd just say, I think we'll continue to make progress on the ERU growth with another month of blended pricing in at 5-3 above that.
Austin Wurschmidt: What month do you typically peak from a seasonality perspective?
Tim Argo: Last year we peaked in May. This year right now, the peak would be July, and too early to say where August will be.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. And then just last one for me. Based on kind of the refined supply analysis, you guys have done a lot of work on that front. But curious how the supply compares in the back half of the year versus the first half?
Eric Bolton: Austin, this is Eric. I would tell you that the, we think that the supply levels over the back half of the year probably are a little bit higher than what we saw in the first half. We continue to see a lot of evidence of delays occurring in the construction processes. A combination of construction labor shortage coupled with a lot of the regulatory our oversight processes that these cities and others inspections that have to get done, a lot of these cities really backlogged right now. So we have seen supply over the first half of this year come in a little less than we expected and really that's just delayed.So I think that we're in a period right now we're just supply is going to continue to be fairly high, I think it's moving around a little bit, usually delayed a little bit for the reasons I just mentioned. Having said all that, I am comforted by the fact that I think we're also at a point where it's unlikely. We see a material increase in the supply levels, given the challenges that are continuing to mount on getting deals to pencil. So as a consequence of that, I just think that over the back half of this year, if I had to guess right now, I would tell you that it will be a little bit higher than what we saw the first half of this year. We'll have a lot more to say about 2020 later this year as we complete our more detailed analysis.
Operator: And we can take our next question from Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Trent Trujillo: Hi, Good morning. Just following up really quickly on Austin's question there about supply in your previous disclosures, you mentioned about 48% of your NOI would have lower supply at 44% higher, and 8 about the same, roughly. That was earlier in the year with the shift of supply going in the second half does that dynamic change. Do you happen to have updated figures to think about how supply is impacting your NOI?
Thomas Grimes: What I would tell you, Trent, is that I don't have the specifics here in front of me. And as I mentioned, we'll be doing a lot more detailed analysis on this as part of our budgeting process that gets under way later in the fall. But I would tell you that those numbers are, the percentage that's going to get better is going to be a little lower. The percentage is going to get worse, is going to be a little bit higher. And it's just shifting around a little bit over the course of this year, but as I say a lot of the delays that we've seen take place just put some of the stuff, more toward the back half of the year.
Trent Trujillo: Okay, I appreciate that context and look forward to the next update. As it relates to your updated dispositions guidance, it sounded like you're exiting Arkansas completely. Why are you making that decision and are and are other markets you're considering exiting given the pricing strength that you cited in terms of market deals?
Thomas Grimes: Our strategy surrounding dispositions is really built around almost really starting in an asset level and considering age of asset, CapEx requirements that may or may not be growing and sort of what the long-term value growth prospect is, comparing that to alternatives that we might be able to fine with that capital.As we began Little Rock's market, we've been in since our days of our IPO, the five properties that we, that we have there have an average age of roughly about 25 years old. So these are assets that we just felt like have reached a point in their life cycle, that we need to rotate out of. And we think better to exit the market altogether versus just pulling out two or three assets out of the market, given the size of that market. So that's what really drove us on that.Going forward, as has been our approach, I mean we will look at this every year. I think it's important that we strive to cycle capital out of some of our older assets every year. And we will look at that going forward into next year. There'll be as it turns out a lot of our older assets tend to be in some of the smaller markets that we have where we also have, frankly, a little bit of inefficiency from an overhead perspective. So I think you'll see us continuing to work to clean that up over the next couple of years.
Operator: And we can take our next question from Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Your line is open.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. Just going back to lease lover-lease pricing. It's obviously strong on an absolute and year-over-year basis. But how does that spread versus last year trend within your expectations for the back half of this year?
Al Campbell: This is Nick, this is Al. I think as we look at the back half of the year we certainly have seen a great spread and a lot of momentum over the last couple of quarters for a lot of reasons, and Tom to talk about the reasons for that. I think when we look at the back half of the year, we are expecting that year-over-year spread to tighten a bit.Primarily related, as we talked about maybe moving into the softer leasing season or the more challenging leasing season, and you've got to remember and total revenue, when you look at that, we still have the 20 basis point occupancy. So I think in summary, we expect it to continue tightening. We hope to outperform that, but that's what we've outlined our plans on.
Thomas Grimes: I would just add to that, I think that to some degree some of the lift is occurring right now is coming out of some of the legacy post locations and it's a combination of just market dynamics coupled with frankly just a little bit more stability now on the operating side of the platform as it pertains to those properties. And we really began to see some early trends of that emerging late last year. And so as a consequence of now going a full year, I think that that will further support what Al's suggesting, that we'll see a little compression of that on a year-over-year basis.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. If it was 170 basis points in the second quarter, where could that spread go to in the back half?
Thomas Grimes: I think we expect in the fourth quarter, which is your most challenging, to be a pretty tight spread over the prior year, is kind of what we expect. And so that's, but again that, what's important to remember that's lease-over-lease that we're talking about here, and now the momentum that ultimately frankly really matters is what's happening with effective rent per unit, which really drives revenue. And we think that that momentum in ERU will continue as a consequence of what has been happening with lease release over the last five or six months.
Tim Argo: And certainly contemplated in the guidance, as you see. You can do the math on that Nick, but expected revenue is 2-8 year-to-date and 3 for the year, 3 and a quarter range average for the back half. So that, so we still have to have the trends playing into strengthen our portfolio. But this gap over the prior year in terms of that, just improvement of a trend, we expect that to narrow a bit as we get to the end of the year.
Nicholas Joseph: Excellent, thanks. So then from a short-term funding perspective, how do you think about and expect to balance the use of the CP Program versus using the line?
Thomas Grimes: We've got a little discussion on that as we put that and we're happy to put that program in, and first of all, and we think that is sort of them, one of the final ways we can use the strength of our balance sheet to lower our borrowing costs and we're using it, the way we're going to use it to just tell you is it's essentially do the same borrowings and we would have done on our line of credit. But just do it cheaper. I mean at the end of the day its working capital borrowings that we're targeting. And so you'll see the borrowings on our commercial paper go up, you'll see it come down, just like we would you would have seen our line of credit and our line of credit will stay closer to zero.And so we're doing that because there's some pretty significant savings in that, just using our balance sheet. We think we've gotten to little strong level now and so we're not increasing, we're not taking on marginal debt, and we're actually, you talked about the comments, we improving the average maturity of our debt extending it out. So we feel like that where we're getting cost savings, we're not adding risk or balance sheet and that's how we expect to use the program. Hopefully that answered your question.
Nicholas Joseph: It does. So you'll use the line essentially as a backstop to the CP Program in case there is ever any issues on the CPE side?
Thomas Grimes: Exactly right. And the program we're going to cap with capping our commercial paper borrowings of $500 million, have a $1 billion line, and to your point, fully stopping that. So we haven't, we see no risk to that program or low risk.
Operator: And we will take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
John Kim: Thank you. On your blended lease growth rate assumption for the year, how realistic is even the midpoint of this because you got 3.9% in the first quarter, 5% second quarter, it looks like 3rd quarter probably will get at least what you did achieve in 2nd quarter. So you really need a huge drop-off down to about 2% to even if you have reach the midpoint of your guidance, can you just comment on that?
Thomas Grimes: Well, I think it's going to be a couple of things that it's to some degree, what we've what we talked about a moment ago, and that we do see market conditions continue to be very competitive. We do think that as a consequence of supply delay in the first half of the year that is conceivable. We see a little bit more supply pressure in certain markets at certain locations in the back half of the year.So I think that factors into our thinking here a little bit, coupled with the fact, the second point being that we really began to get the momentum on the lease over lease performance in the back half of last year. And a lot of that, as I said was recovery taking place and some of the legacy post asset locations. As we now come full cycle, full year on that improvement trend the comparisons will get a little bit tougher. So I think that for a couple of reasons you'll just see the lease-over-lease comparisons get a little bit more challenging in that regard.
Tim Argo: And just make sure to add it is very common and expected in our, in our business in our model that in the fourth quarter because of slower traffic and things you will have a moderating blended lease over lease we've seen in the past, we expect that we expect to have good comparison compared to prior year, but that is a typical part of our business. I think when you think about that plus the occupancy decline that we built in a 20 basis points to continue to, to get that pricing that drives your total revenue.
Eric Bolton: Yes, I'll add John. I mean the midpoint of our lease-over-lease pricing 3.9, we are 4.5 year-to-date through June. So it's still implying a pretty strong, call it 3.5 lease-over-lease growth the full six months of the back half.
John Kim: And is there any update on the portfolio wide rebranding?
Thomas Grimes: Nothing really to to talk about of substance at this point. It's something we continue to look at and refine and work on. We'll have more to say about that as we, as we go into next year.
John Kim: It's more of 2020 event.
Thomas Grimes: Yeah.
John Kim: Thank you.
Thomas Grimes: Thanks, John.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning. So a question on your investment activity. So you lowered your full-year acquisition expectations by $75 million despite an improved cost of capital here versus the start of the year.And given your comments earlier, it sounds like market pricing has reached levels you're not quite comfortable with. So what's your mindset here on perhaps more opportunistic dispositions? Any other markets beyond a Little rock that you may consider exiting on an opportunistic basis?
Eric Bolton: Hi, Haendel, this is Eric. I mean, our plans for the year, really, and the focus we have is limited to the Little Rock dispositions. We continue to think about looking for ways to continue to deploy capital to capture growth in between our free cash flow and the asset sales that we are triggering, that covers it and.And so, I mean broadly, we like the diversification, we have in our portfolio. We like the footprint, we like to balance between both some of the larger and some of the smaller markets. So there is nothing fundamental about the portfolio composition today that we think needs to be altered or needs to be changed. It's Just really just a combination of what our capital needs for supporting new growth and how do we fund that growth, and I think asset sales should always be a part of that effort.And right now we are just finding that the best uses of capital, other than the redevelopment effort that we have, really centers on the in-house development that we're doing as well as some of the JV development that we're doing. We're essentially pre-purchasing something to be built, and when we look at the opportunities that we have to deploy capital at the moment, coupled with free cash flow in the cash proceeds were generated from the asset sales, all kind of works and keeps the balance sheet, strong and so doing anything beyond what we're doing at the moment, it doesn't seem to be something we need to do.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it, got it, helpful, thanks Eric. And maybe some more commentary on the land acquisitions in the quarter. Sounds like Orlando in Huntsville you're on track for late 2019 start. I think you previously mentioned in your development yield target 6, 6.5. So I'm curious how the current underwriting for those two projects compares to the overall pipeline and then maybe some color on how those yields compared to prevailing cap rates in those specific markets.
Eric Bolton: Just to be clear, the hunt you mentioned Huntsville, that was an asset sale. We're not buying land in Huntsville. But we did buy a site in downtown Orlando. We continue to believe that based on our latest underwriting that those, that property along with the others that we've forecasted is to start and we're going to be able to deliver a stabilized yield and that's 6 to 6.5 range.One of the things that we look at in an effort to make sure that we're deploying capital in a value-accretive manner is we take a look at what is the, cap rate that we will, could, that we're delivering, if you will, a new development at, using today's rents, looking at assumptions that we make regarding CapEx and the management fee and then what are all-in basis is going to be.And if we can deliver an asset today into the market at a 100 basis points or more spread in terms of the cap rate versus where assets are trading out in the market today, we think that's a value add. And every one of these properties that we're looking to tee up to start this year fit that hurdle easily. So we still think that it makes sense to continue moving ahead with the development that we are doing.
Haendel St. Juste: Thanks for the clarification, but within the, what assumptions for rent growth and expense growth are embedded within that stabilized yield protection?
Eric Bolton: Usually we assume zero to 1%, if anything, in the first year or two. And by the time we get to actually starting to deliver units, that first year we're delivering units. I guess, again it will a very by market, will vary by project, but it may be 2% to 3%. And of course you know when you factor in what we always assume some kind of lease-up concessions that we bring into it, t brings the effective rent growth down 2% or less. So it is fairly modest assumptions obviously during the construction in the lease-up period before we get to a stabilized situation where,- and leasing concessions can be burned off and then you get into more of a normalized 3 to 3.5, whatever, depending on the market. Depending on the particular location.
Haendel St. Juste: On the expense side, any trending there or the cost fairly locked in?
Eric Bolton: We usually trend that pretty consistent at 2.5% to 3%, and we kind of start that on day one. I mean generally during, in the modeling in the first year or two during the development period, I mean, our expense growth rate exceeds our revenue growth rate.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you.
Operator: And we can take our next question from Drew Babin with Baird. Your line is open.
Drew Babin: Good morning. This is Alex on for Drew, just one quick one for us. We were curious if you could break down the leasing performance of Post and legacy MAA assets and Atlanta, Dallas and Charlotte given you guys impressive performance year-to-date? We're just curious on what the position is in those really important markets and are hoping to hear the Post is really flowing through to the P&L at this point.
Eric Bolton: Yes, I mean the Post movement certainly helped us. Blended for Mid America is 5.3, Post is 3.9 on an overall basis, but when you take just the assets for Post in Austin, Dallas, Atlanta, Charlotte they're like 340 basis points better than last year, and so that's, has helped a great deal.
Drew Babin: That's very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: And we can take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Tom, most of your markets are outperforming expectations, but where do you see this sort of pockets of weakness or the smallest level of outperformance among your major markets?
Thomas Grimes: Yeah, Rob, I would say, you know, I mean you can look at the numbers and sort of being comparative Dallas is weaker, but it is, it's sort of moved along at a good pace. The two markets that were a little weaker than we expected were really Houston and Orlando. And those are there still pretty, they are both doing fairly well. We just expected a little more blended progress out of those in the first half of the year than we got.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then why was the per-unit redevelopment cost so low in the second quarter? You were about $600 per unit lower than the first quarter.
Thomas Grimes: It's likely just mix on that, Rob. I mean, no real changes with it, but it just depends on where the availability comes on it, whether it's a high cost renovate, we just did more lower than higher this time around. But no real strategy shift and it will change again.
Rob Stevenson: So you did skinny redevelopments?
Thomas Grimes: I'm sorry, say again, your block there a little bit.
Rob Stevenson: Yes, so you were, so-called skinny redevelopments, where you just do kitchen and no bath, or a bath and no kitchen and things of that nature. That did not factor into the mix?
Thomas Grimes: No, we didn't, we didn't change our strategy there. Just, just to which units turn or what generated the difference.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then last one for me. Al, the preferred derivative numbers, is that a one-time item or is that a recurring sort of amortizing thing?
Al Campbell: Yeah, you know, what will happen is it will slowly over time amortized, we have an asset on the balance sheet now because of the favorability that's built up in that, and it was recorded initially. It will slowly, for about nine more years, amortize off, but it's going to be very volatile with primarily interest rate changes. Rob. So there's no cash value that, no change in our business. I mean it's really, it's frustrating us.But what we do, as you saw in our guidance, we had a very favorable amount this quarter purely related to the change in interest rates we thought that volatile, who knows what's going to happen. We just like to take that out. And so in the 4th quarter, we said the year-to-date favorability of $0.03 we took it out in the 4th quarter and has zero impact on earnings for this year. That's the way we prefer you guys think about it, that's really how we think about it. And so that's kind of how we do it.
Rob Stevenson: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: And we will take our next question from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is now open.
John Guinee: Great, thank you, and nice quarter. I'm looking at your development strategy you've got about 1,100 units under construction right now, mostly in the early phases then some in lease-up, and I think you said you were going to announce four more in addition to what you've got on page S-8. Is there a trend? Because what we see throughout the industry is more movement away from high-rise and podium and into wrap and garden, and more move maybe into secondary locations where land can be acquired at a more reasonable number. Any trends, you could comment on?
Eric Bolton: I think you're right. John, I think we are seeing more suburban garden-style or mid-rise wrap out in some of these satellite cities and/or suburban locations and less downtown, city-type. Development of the four projects that will begin later this year, one is in downtown area of Orlando. The other three are out in satellite, market satellite cities in Denver and Houston and in Orlando. So I think you're right, I think you're just you're seeing some of the capital migrate more to, away from some of the more inner city type locations.
John Guinee: And any comment on wraps versus podium, in terms of what it cost to build and where you're getting, you see a better return right now?
Eric Bolton: Usually the wrap is going to be a little bit better, but for us right now. I mean all three of the locations that we're looking at are surface park. So we, it varies a bit. In course numbers the are, the cost are moving around a little bit as some of the impact of tariffs and other things start to start to make an impact.
Operator: And we can take our next question from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Hardik Goel: Hi guys, nice quarter. Thanks for taking my question. You guys, January I think it was, or maybe before that in March. You guys put out the margin for the Post portfolio and your MAA legacy portfolio, and that was quite a spread there. What is the spread today and where do you expect it to go, maybe over the next couple of years, just longer term?
Thomas Grimes: We don't have it right in front of us at the moment on the, where it is right now, but I would tell you, obviously the gap is closing. I mean we fully anticipate that the legacy Post margin, Post asset margin will surpass the legacy MAA margin at some point. I think we're probably another couple of years away from that as the redevelopment effort continues to work its way through that, that portfolio. We got a lot of the expense gains are ready and that, and that's what help close the gap. As Tom's alluded to, we're seeing great pricing momentum out of the legacy Post locations now, and I think is going to continue to work on that gap and it will close more over the next year or so.And then is the redevelopment continues to kick in, I think it will, it will, at some point it will surpass it. I mean, that was ultimately one of the things that compelled us on the merger transaction itself, was that when you look at the two portfolios side by side, recognizing that the Post locations commanded an average rent structure that was $500 more per month than what legacy MAA was commanding, but yet legacy MAA had a 100 basis point higher operating margin. We knew there is opportunity there. And we'll see that continue to emerge over the next couple of years.
Operator: And we will go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Wes Golladay: Yes, good morning guys. As we look to the second half of the year, are you seeing any sub-markets that stand out as you may know, causing maybe the biggest variance to your forecast at the end of the year from developers offering a lot of concessions and that, would be not even, not available to push rate, any occupancy risk, sort of like we had in uptown Texas a few years ago?
Thomas Grimes: That Uptown deal happen kind of as the first, the leading edge of supply hit that market, and I think in most places. I'm trying to think of an exception right now Wes, and I can't. The pipeline is pretty steady and I think we will see it taper off in the back half of the year, as it always does seasonally, but I don't see us going over a cliff on pricing in any one market at this point.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And how is the Dallas market progressing for you? Is supply now starting to move to different markets? Do you see a gradually improving as we get through next year?
Thomas Grimes: The, Dallas is, I mean there is a fair amount of supply moving through the system. It is competitive, but we are making better progress there. So Dallas as a group, blended pricing is up 250 basis points. So we're handling well, demand is excellent, but we're going to need demand to stay intact for it to continue. But we like the progress that we've made in Dallas, and particularly in uptown .
Wes Golladay: Okay and then just for the portfolio level, how is rent to income trending for new residents?
Thomas Grimes: It hasn't really budged. It's right there and that 19% to 20% range, and very, very steady.
Wes Golladay: Great, thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Your line is open.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Eric, what type of blended cap rate do you think you could fetch on the Arkansas portfolio sale?
Eric Bolton: You know, we will see. I mean we are in the market right now, but I would anticipate something in the 5.5 range.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Tom, apologies if I missed this. Marketing costs were up 10%. Are you guys doing anything different on the concession front for your stabilized same-store pull?
Eric Bolton: No, we are not, that is not gift cards. Thank you for asking that question, John. We had some one-time expenses with, related to the ramp of our new marketing platform. Expect that to trend down over the last half of the year and being more normalized range for marketing. It never occurred to me to address that in that way, and I really appreciate you asking that.
John Pawlowski: Not coupons, and not gift cards, it's not --
Eric Bolton: It is none of those things. Al will let me do any of those things.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Alright, thank you.
Operator: And will take our final question from Buck Horne with Raymond James, your line is open.
Buck Horne: Hey, thanks for the time, appreciate it. Just following up on the expenses, and the operating expense guidance here. And I know property taxes have kind of been out of your control to a degree here, and I understand the comment about a tougher year-over-year comp against the savings from Post last year, but I guess the question is why weren't those savings that were achieved a little bit more sustainable on a year-over-year basis? I'm just wondering, I know you're at an elevated level historically, but why weren't those overall operating level synergies more sustainable?
Thomas Grimes: They were sustained. I think that our point is, I mean we captured those efficiencies, they are now, if you will, memorialized into our system. And so we absolutely believe that the synergies that we captured the last couple of years in the margin improvement that came from that is very much intact.I think the point really is just that is there is some, it's not so much inflation, to some degree, it's, I mean, you're seeing some wage inflation and you're seeing some level of material, maintenance material cost rise, taking place and so our ability to rework to staffing model or rework the model that we did last year on how we turn apartments and how we staff for that, those gains have already been captured and they are still there, but we don't have the gain this year to offset the rise that we see taking place in some of these other line items.So that's really the point that we're making. But, but for absolute certain the gains that we have made over the last years are very much intact.
Eric Bolton: I'll on to that. In our long-term history book, and you will know this is one of the things we've seen is very good expense control has been about 2.5% on average, 3% this year is really that some of the pressure from a real estate taxes and as Tom mentioned, in the back half of the year some of the other expense lines are going to moderate a little bit and get us that 3%. So I think we still a long term expect 2.5% range with a short-term impact from taxes as that hopefully moderates over the next couple of years as cap rates remain stable.
Buck Horne: Now, that's very helpful color, I appreciate that very much. And just real quick on the acquisition guidance reduction, just how competitive it is out there, and just wondering if you can maybe just add a little bit of color in terms of what you're seeing and how competitive the bidders are? Just, I think you mentioned earlier in the call that cap rates were stable but it seems to suggest if you're, with your improved cost of capital and how competitive things are out there if you're having to reduce the guidance. It seems like yields might be compressing out there in any extra thoughts you may have there?
Eric Bolton: I do think yields are compressing. I think that we are seeing as a consequence of efforts by a lot of private equity to get the capital deployed that they are, they are at a point where I mean, they're either getting much more aggressive on their underwriting assumptions in terms of rent growth or other line item expectations, or they're compromising yields a little bit. I don't think there has been a material shift in cost of capital for them, per se, other than just they're forcing a more modest return on some of the equity that that they perhaps we're hoping to get earlier. So I think yields are compressing a little bit.
Buck Horne: Any chance you could kind of quantify what you think Class A or Class B and core Southeastern markets is going for these days?
Eric Bolton: I mean it's the is compressed a good bit, I mean we're routinely seeing Class A assets are trading 4.25 to 4.75 range in terms of cap rate, in older B asset may be 5 to 5.5 range. It depends on the market, but it's, in some cases even lower than that on the Bs. If you think there is a redevelopment or repositioning opportunity that's where you see a lot of aggressive activity occurring where you'll see a 10 to 15 year old asset trade in some cases, at a sub 5, the cost, the plan is to go in and do a massive upgrade and I think they'll get massive rent growth as a result and get the returns they're after and therefore they they'll pay out big time upfront.
Buck Horne: Great, very helpful, thank you.
Operator: And we will take another question. It comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Your line is open.
Richard Anderson: Hi, thanks for taking it. I jumped on late. Was a topic of rent control brought up at all on the call yet?
Thomas Grimes: No, it was not, Rich.
Richard Anderson: And so I guess the question is do you have any, any of that percolating through your portfolio in terms of something that could be coming down the pike that you have to defend? I'm just curious if that's happening anywhere. It's big news item in California and New York.
Thomas Grimes: Right, no, to be honest with you, we're not seeing really much happening in any of our markets are any dialog along those lines. In Denver, we've seen a little conversation taking place out there, but I do think that we are very alert to the growing issue of housing affordability. For the most part throughout our Southeast markets where we see the issue kind of coming up is new development starts requiring a certain affordability component to what they do, and a certain percent of the units have to be limited in terms of the rent that can be charged and at this point anything beyond that is not something that we see being actively talked about. But we're staying very closely attuned to lot of the local associations and state apartment associations and it's something we're all watching very closely.
Richard Anderson: Okay, great. That's all I have. Thanks very much
Thomas Grimes: Thanks, Rich. Thanks so much.
Operator: This does conclude the Q&A session. I would like to turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional comments.
Tim Argo: All right. Nothing else on our end appreciate everyone joining us this morning and will see everyone, I'm sure later this year. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, May 2, 2019. I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. Please go ahead.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO, Tom Grimes, our COO; and Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussions, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and good morning. We're off to a good start for the year as the first quarter's growth and effective rent is the highest that we've captured over the past 8 quarters. Resident turnover remains historically low levels and rent growth on renewal transactions continue to be strong. The increase in combined new and renewal lease rates on a lease-over-lease basis was 240 basis points ahead of the performance in Q1 of last year. We're of course just now entering the spring and summer leasing season, but we certainly like the trends that we're capturing as the compounding benefit of steady rent growth continues to make a growing and positive impact. Strong expense control continues to be evident, particularly in the areas of repair and maintenance cost and utility expenses. Our property and asset management teams continue their record of innovation and expanding use of new technology, while also continuing to leverage the benefits of the larger scale of our platform. Beyond these encouraging trends with the same-store portfolio, our new development portfolio, our current lease sub-property portfolio and our redevelopment pipeline, all continue to come online and will make increasing contributions to FFO over the next couple of years. Our high-growth Sun Belt markets continue to capture steady job growth and solid demand for apartment housing. As pressures are earning high housing and related cost of challenges continue to influence population growth and migration trends across the country, we continue to favor our regional focus. Across our portfolio, average rent as a percentage of monthly income continues to hover our in the 20% range a very affordable relationship. We believe that 3 to 4 cycle, our regional markets will drive job growth and resulting demand for apartment housing that will outperform other regions of the country. As a recap in our recently published annual report, after 2 years, with a heavy focus on significantly retooling and integrating our operating platform, we believe that MAA is no even stronger and better positioned. We're excited to be now fully focused on capturing the opportunities associated with the enhancements that were made. We look forward to continued positive momentum over the coming year. With that I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our operating performance for the year started off well. We've continued momentum in rent growth, strong average daily occupancy and improving trends. The factor rent growth per unit was 3.1% for the quarter, this was the fourth straight quarter of improving year-on-year growth. For perspective, in the first quarter of 2018, this number was 1.4% from 1.7% in the second quarter, 2.1% for the third quarter, 2.4% in the fourth quarter and is now up 70 basis points sequentially. Said another way, in the last year, we've doubled the - our effective rent growth rate. We're pleased with the positive trend of this steady compounding driver of long-term revenue growth. This of course is led by a steady momentum and blended lease over lease pricing. Blended lease over lease rents for the quarter were up 3.9%, which is 240 basis points better than this time last year. Average daily occupancy remains strong at 95.9%. Expense performance was steady for the first quarter, up just 2.1%. And marketing growth rate stands out in our report, but that was a result of the credit in last year's numbers. Adjusting for this anomaly, marketing expenses would be flat with prior year. As a reminder, our annual operating expense growth rate since 2012 has been just 2.4%, well below the sector average. The favorable trends continued in April. We're on track for ended the month of strong blended lease-over-lease pricing. April blended lease-over-lease rates were up over 4%, which is well ahead of the 2.8% posted in April last year. Average daily occupancy for the month continued at a strong 95.9. Our 60-day exposure, which represents all vacant units and move-out notices for a 60-day period is 8.4%, which is in line with last year. On the redevelopment front, in the first quarter, we completed about 1,700 units, which keeps us on track to redevelop 8,000 units in 2019. This is one of our best uses of capital. On average, we spend $6,100 per unit and achieve an additional 11% in rent, which generates a year 1 cash-on-cash return in excess of 20%. Our total redevelopment pipeline now stands in the neighborhood of 16,000 units to 17,500 units. The latest market delivery information is in line with our prior forecast. Job growth in our market is expected to be 2.1% versus 1.6% nationally. As long as demand remains strong, we expect the positive rent growth will continue to build. Our teams are pleased to have the work of 2017 and 2018 in the rearview mirror. We're encouraged with the momentum in rent growth and excited to have our transformed platform fully operational. Al?
Albert Campbell: Thank you, Tom, good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary in company's first quarter earnings performance, our balance sheet activity and then finally, an updated guidance for the remainder of the year. FFO of $1.58 per share for the first quarter was $0.11 per share above our guidance for the quarter. Excluding 2 items not included in our forecast, a gain on sale of the land parcels and per share adjustment, which will discuss in a moment. FFO for the quarter was $1.51 per share, which was $0.04 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. Operating results were $0.02 per share favorable to our profitable cash, with positive contributions from both same-store revenue and expense performance during the quarter. A continued strong occupancy supported the favorable rental pricing trends outlined by Tom, while favorable repair and maintenance and utilities cost also continued pressure from real estate taxes during the quarter. The real estate tax expense growth was 6% for the quarter, includes the impact of some counting of appeals. And we still expect our total cost to grow in the range of three and three quarters to four and three quarter [indiscernible] for the full year. Favorable performance for interest expense and other income during the quarter, primarily related to our recent bond deal and cancel the gains combined to add the remaining $0.02 per share to FFO for the quarter. We also sold a small land parcels located in Atlanta during the quarter, which was acquired in the post-merger. The parcel was not a viable development for us and was sold as an alternative youth. Giving significant certainty regarding ultimate closing of the sale, the gain of $0.08 per share was not included in our original guidance for the year. In addition, we incurred noncash expenses of about $0.01 per share during the quarter, related to the market-to-market adjustment of preferred shares, which consistent with our practice was also not included in our forecast. During the quarter, we completed a significant portion of our financing plans for the full year, with the issuance of $300 million in new 10-year public bonds and the effective rate, including the impact of several swaps of 4.24% and with the closing of an additional $191 million of fixed rate mortgages, priced at very attractive 4.43% for 30 years. The proceeds were used to pay down unsecured line of credit with the years to provide majority of financing needs for the remaining of the year. We've also continued to make progress on our development pipeline, coming $15 million during our construction cost during the quarter. We expect to fully complete 2 communities this year and also likely start additional projects as part of our $100 million to $150 million total projected funding for the full year. Now we continue to expect the combined stabilized NOI year-end view on the pipeline to be in the 6% to 6.5% range. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with low leverage, with 32.6% debt-to-total assets, with over 85% of our debt fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an increased average maturity of 8 years. At quarter end, we had over $967 million of cash and funding capacity under our line of credit and our current forecasted is leverage neutral. Finally, we are revising our FFO guidance for the full year to reflect first quarter performance as well as our updated projections for transactions and debt financing plans for the remainder of the year, which are now expected to reduce FFO by about $0.03 per share compared to our previous forecast. Also, just as a reminder, we do not forecast any future noncash adjustments to the valuation of our preferred shares. FFO for the full year is now projected to be $6.11 to $6.35 or $6.23 per share at the midpoint, which is $0.08 per share increase of our previous guidance. We also announced net income per diluted common share to be $2.19 to $2.43 per share for the full year. We're certainly encouraged with a strong first quarter performance, but we still have very important leasing season ahead of us - a busy leasing season out of us, and our comparisons do become a bit more challenging over the remainder of the year. We're maintaining our previous same-store guidance, and we plan to revisit these projection with our second quarter earnings. So that's all we have in the way I've prepared our comments. So Chris, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Nicholas Joseph: Al, you mentioned the current development pipeline and NOI yields of about 6% to 6.5%. How does it compare to the new starts expected this year when the recently land acquisitions.
Albert Campbell: You're talking about the new Phoenix deal that was a prepurchase, that we announced, nick. Is that what a comparison of that?
Nicholas Joseph: That will be a - the development start later in the year and then the land that you acquired in Orlando. Are you also underwriting the 6% to 6.5% for that?
Albert Campbell: Right, right. And was the intend of the comments. So really you got the current deals we have underway as well as the ones we plan to start later this year. All of those will be in the range of 6% to 6.5% pipeline will obviously in that range as well. So none we see as below that level here at this point.
Nicholas Joseph: All right. Perfect. And how does that compare to cap rates in those market today?
Eric Bolton: I would say, Nick, for the quality of assets that we're looking to develop, I mean, those cap rates are going to be 4 75, 4.5 to 4 75 [ph] is really what we're seeing today.
Nicholas Joseph: And Eric, you mentioned the strength in the market. I'm wondering if you're seeing new rents [indiscernible] and I'm sure you track where they're moving. Any population flows or any change in trends from the north east to other there high tax states, just driven by the change in tax laws?
Eric Bolton: I'm going to let Tom mentioned that.
Thomas Grimes: I mean sort of the best - I mean certainly we're seeing the shift in change, and we're seeing strength in the Sunbelt. Honestly, the best explanation I've seen of this is a third-party firm tracks Uhaul rentals, and it cost 25% less to move back up north than it does to move to the Sun Belt, that we are - we don't have specific information on it exactly that. But it is - the trends are positive.
Albert Campbell: I would tell you, Nick, that we continue to, I think Nashville is going to continue to see some migrations inflows, if you will. coming out of Northeast particularly as the Bernstein will begin to shape up. I think the Raleigh area continues to attract a lot of particularly technology-based jobs, both from Northeast West Coast, of course Austin has been doing some time. So I think we don't particularly track exactly comp sales were people come from necessarily. But just anecdotally, based on the information and the conversations we're having with residents, we're seeing growing evidence that folks are moving out of some of these higher cost areas of the country.
Eric Bolton: And then in Phoenix, we see, Phoenix, Denver, Denver Austin, we see inflows from California, as you would expect.
Operator: And our next question comes from Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank.
Trent Trujillo: So within the last months, a roughly $1.5 billion suburban class A Sun Belt portfolio traded for what looks like a high-4 cap rate. How interested for you in that portfolio? And how do you view the pricing with respect to I guess one other transactions you're seeing in the market? And two, perhaps, as a validation of the value of your portfolio?
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean, to answer, Trent, we didn't look at it. That's not really what asset quality that we're looking to add to the portfolio for growth rate to want to achieve organic growth rate do you want to achieve going forward. So total portfolio then typically take a look at. Having said that, certainly, based on the pricing that we're seeing, that pricing is in line, maybe a little bit aggressive. Routinely, the new product that we're looking at still lease-up over just recently stabilized in the markets throughout our region, are trading anywhere from 4.5 to 4.75 cap rate. So high-4, call it a five for that portfolio is probably about right, in line with the market. It just depends on, frankly, what sort of upside opportunity they saw in the portfolio from either CapEx or development of operating perspective.
Trent Trujillo: And quick follow-up. So I think we all appreciate the year-over-year and even sequential improvement in great growth, which is greater fundamental level, but it doesn't seem to be translating that into accelerating same store revenue growth. Correctly sequentially. So maybe if you can talk about how the improved flow to the bottom line. And then, considering some persistent supply pressures and some of your larger markets. How confident are you that this improvement spread can persist? And what that may imply for the rest of the year?
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean, we feel pretty good about the ability for the rent growth trends to continue, based on everything that we're seeing. Supply levels, while they remain high in the number of markets, they don't appear to be getting any higher, if you will. And I would suggest that we're at a point broadly where supply levels are likely to show stability, into slight moderation over the next call it a couple of years. As long as a job growth continues to be as robust as it is. I think it sets up for the ability to sustain the we're seeing. The ability for that rent growth trend ultimately make us way to the overall revenue line if you will is a function of a also a variable how they're performing daily occupancy and fees or other income. And we saw occupancy effective daily occupancy trade off a little bit from last year. As we contemplated in our guidance for the year, we think that's the right trade-off to be making at this point in the cycle. And I'm comfortable with that assumption, and I'm comfortable with what we're seeing. I think that is get later in the year particularly next year. The occupancy performance likely start to stabilize on a year-over-year basis and therefore, the rent growth trends start to drive more directly to the bottom line. To some degree, the other area that we see underperform in terms of rent level are in terms of growth year-over-year a revenue area since other fees and the fee area in general. And because terrorists were solo and people were stapled we're not seeing termination fees and other comp related fees associated with the moving to move out likely seen the past. So the occupancy variable year-over-year and the fee variable year-over-year has worked against if you will the rent growth variable to result in the revenue performance that you see. We think those are the two variables: a fees and occupancy, probably will start to stabilize going into next year and the rent growth becomes more impactful.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: On the rented lease rate growth, it sounds like you have about 4% year-to-date through April. I realize Have several comps at the second of the year. But what would get you down deceleration that implies at the midpoint of your guidance of 2.7%?
Albert Campbell: Yes. John, I mean, obviously, what we're talking about is as we're very encouraged with what we've seeing through - all the way through April, as Tom talks about it. And it will take a number quite lower than that to get us down. I think what we're seeing is as we look at the next few months or next two quarters, that's when we face the biggest part of our exposure, the vast majority of releases. So at this point, we're not seeing - we certainly believe and expect to continue to push pricing. But the question is going to be, are we able to hold the occupancy while we're doing that? We think at this point, we will. But as we talked about the guys were leaving their excess [ph] room to work to those two quarters, and then we'll have more say about that and more clarity at the end of the second quarter.
John Kim: Okay. So that occupancy, that's more of the same-store revenue concept rather than the growth rate. But just you have additional vacancy that might ...
Albert Campbell: I'm saying, it'd offset the rent. I mean in other words, we're going to continue pushing price, and we believe we can hold occupancy at strong 9 59, but that's the question as we hit the busy leasing season.
Eric Bolton: John, it's Eric. If your point is, are we likely to continue to perform at the upper end of our pricing assumptions, lease over lease pricing assumptions that put out there the answer would be yes. We think that the pricing trends are likely to continue, which would put us more likely to not well above the midpoint in terms of our assumption for pricing trends along.
John Kim: This quarter you broke out redevelopment CapEx. And can you just remind us what constitutes the difference between the two?
Tim Argo: Yes. I mean we just want to get more information there and really provide as much clarity as we could there, John. I mean revenue enhancing is a more typical CapEx that you do, the normal that you would you do every year in the portfolio to continue to maintain it.
Albert Campbell: I think that's recurring.
Tim Argo: I'm sorry. That's recurring. Recurring is typical - redevelopment is the capital. But we actually that we measure and we add our returns to our growth and we've talked about it. And as Tom talk about some of the best uses of our capital that we have. We've have a program going on for many years now variable to spend unlimited amounts of capital on units strong returns. Server that's really the difference. I think we have on redevelopment we have redeveloped, we have enhancing and then we have recurring and we just want to give you clarity of those three buckets. And so revenue enhancing is additional capital that is not specifically measured, but it's things that we do to think add to value over time. So those are three buckets.
John Kim: But are the redevelopments unit kept in the same-store pools and then this quarter...
Tim Argo: Yes, they are. And when we approached because we do not force terms we do long term. So I think over time we feel like that's the best to keep it in in the same store portfolio. And if we have situation where we did one time it was going to be extremely disruptive. We will call out. I think we've done in the past but the current platform that we are doing we don't expect not taking the same store.
Operator: And our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital.
Austin Wurschmidt: Just curious what you guys would attribute the lease rate successes that you've achieved thus far in the year to whether its operating on a single revenue system? Is that you're starting to see increased contribution from the redev? Or just maybe a more benign supply environment. Can you kind of break out the pieces and tell you where you think - what so you think's driving the success you've had so far.
Eric Bolton: Sure. Austin. I think at a macro level, we've certainly shifted from a ramp-up in supply and stabilization in supply. If from a market standpoint, a little more stable, but still have. And we can push on that. Then the other piece of the puzzle is really the improved I will tell you and the post portfolio. And that is our systems and being operated on 1 system. And let me give you an example of that. So in first quarter of 2017, the gap between blended lease over lease rate and the post portfolio and blended lease over lease rates in the Mid-America portfolio was 290 basis points. Now it was sort of first quarter of having the first portfolio. That gap has closed to just 50 basis points. And that's a result of both portfolios coming over that timeframe.
Austin Wurschmidt: So when you look across markets, is it fewer concessions, maybe in some of those post markets that had supply? Where are you seeing the success in driving blended lease rates?
Eric Bolton: I mean early on, the first thing to take was renewal rates, where we remove those from 4 close to 6 now. And now it is new lease rates coming to bring stability, On a - just on a year-over-year basis, it's primarily the new lease rates, though, we're still up a little bit and renewals. On a going back to 2017, it's really both on the post portfolio.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. Apprized that, And then just last one for me. Al, when you kind of strip out was onetime items in the first quarter and you look at what drove the beat versus your internal guidance, what line items would you attribute that to?
Albert Campbell: We put it really two major groups, $0.02 per share. If you strip out those kind of unusual items, you get to about $0.04 per share out performance from our guidance. $0.02 of that was operations, which that was same-store, pretty even spread between revenue and expenses, I would say. We're encouraged both sides of the performance. The other $0.02 was interest and other income, that was a little favorable to what we expected, primarily related to the timing of the bond that we did, a little better on its rate than we thought there. And then we had other income from casual gain that we had during the quarter that had some income from that, that's really the insurance proceeds over the cost of the books that we wrote off for that cash we lost. So those were the primary pieces.
Operator: And your next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Robert Stevenson: Tom, any markets that performed notably above or below expectations on a year-to-date basis?
Thomas Grimes: Nothing really stands out on the below expectations. Dallas, we expected to be challenging, but it's coming along, honestly. On the above, we're quietly pleased with how Austin's coming along.
Robert Stevenson: Any markets or what - which market, I guess, would you expect to that you could see a positive new lease growth in '19 on at this point?
Thomas Grimes: Seeing positive new lease growth?
Robert Stevenson: Yes. Obviously, the renewals are a bit healthy but the new lease option?
Thomas Grimes: I would tell you Nashville begins to look better in the back half of the year, I think. It supplies moderating a little bit there. And as Eric mentioned, [indiscernible] Bernstein moved in Nashville as a booming market in that, that has the potential to exceed our expectations, I think.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then lastly for me. Where are you guys in sort of technology spend. I mean it seems like all of the apartment, the large apartment guys these days are in an arms races to get to - being able to have a Alexa rent their units, rather than have people in the locations and all of the automation that they want to put in to make leasing able to do from phones, et cetera. How far down the road are you guys in terms of where you want to get over the next couple of years? And what's the spend and what's the trade-off in terms of expenses that you could take out of the business from that?
Eric Bolton: Yes. Rob, I mean, we're currently testing working on and evaluating pretty much everything that you heard out there. Smart, rent, smart homes and hence residential services portal technical ability leasing automation in the service features. Years till at the point, we were not talking we're really trying to find out exactly what those economics are early results are good, especially on the smart home testing. And we think that they have the potential to make a difference, but we're really in the testing phase at this point. And we'll have more to share as the year winds on, I would say.
Robert Stevenson: Al, what are you spending this year on that, roughly?
Albert Campbell: The majority of our spending that is part of our real estate venture fund, which you probably saw 10-K, Rob. And so we spend - we're a part of that with lot of - of some of your peers that really is designed to investment is designed to select, view all of that companies are coming forward and select the winners and be a part of the discussion when it happens. So in terms of our normal spending, investment and driving technology right now that's normal spend that's our overhead and G&A that we budget this year that we talked about always improving the platform. We're testing these programs this year's, as Tom talks about, and probably roll out a little bit more next year when you drive those programs to the portfolio.
Thomas Grimes: And Rod, some of those investments is bundled in the total IT overall that we did as part of the merger. So things like maintenance, mobility and the resident portal improvements, those are embedded in the transition that we just went through. And then were spending the most direct spend is on the smart home or rolling unit out at about $1,000 a unit or so. And we've got plans to test that this year.
Operator: And our next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates.
Hardik Goel: One of the things I wanted to ask about - I've got two for you, is G&A. So we know G&A is going up a little bit, we discussed at last quarter. But looking at the cadence of Genie particularly in the first quarter was still little heavier than gardens would imply. Are you guys still in line with your initial guidance range.
Albert Campbell: We are. That's a great question. I think and I'll point you to one of the things that we talked about and put out as we came out of your rent and discussed our guidance in the years. Is one of the presentations that we have done in the conferences. We put us like to talk about that we expected first quarter to be highest quarter for that, there's portal expenses are for the quarter, some conferencing, some year-end audit things, a few things that typically in the first quarter. So we had expected first quarter overhead to be about 20% - 8% of the year, came in right in line with that. And So we were very comfortable with our full year projection. I think what you would-- should put in your mind when you're thinking for the next 3 quarter, obviously, to get to our run rate, to our full year run rate is more like 24% of the total of our guidance for the year.
Hardik Goel: Got it. Yes, I saw those, I just wanted to confirm. The second one I have for you is on your same store expense growth estimates, you guys talked about revenue, but on expenses, I seems like pretty tough for you to guys not comment at the low end of your expenses, given that you guys outperformed even the taxes were higher. Is there a tax that went through the rest of the year? Or do you expect - what you expect from the expense side?
Albert Campbell: There are two things. I think that's important to considerer there - this is Al, I will start with that but really R&M was favorable within first quarter and utilities cost, I said R&M, repair maintenance, excuse me, utilities cost. And so repair maintenance was really favorable first quarter. We've got some remaining synergies from the post-merger which were good to see. We're glad to get that. I think we expect that we come to the end of that we expect for the remainder of the year from those cost to be more normalized, call it, in 3% range. And then the utilities, they were lower than expected because we had a mild season in the first quarter, mild seasonal cost structure in the first quarter. I think that will normalize as we go into the year. So I would tell you, as we look at the remaining 3 quarters a year, you should consider something more in that 3% range, but everything together. But taken the first quarter performance and that together, we are going to be below the current guidance. But still in the guidance for the year.
Operator: And our next question comes from Drew Babin of Robert.
Andrew Babin: I wanted to talk about capital recycling. It sounds from the way that fundamentals are unfolding across Sunbelt potential for distressed acquisitions, things like that, might not be there yet as it really hasn't done for a couple of years. And I guess I was hoping an update on, are you seeing that anywhere you seem developers may be looking to do to sell more assets? How is your pipeline looking as it pertains to things that I just mentioned?
Eric Bolton: Drew, this is Eric. Our deal flow continues to be incredibly high. We're looking for deals on a quarterly basis now than we have over the last 5 years. So it - there's a lot of opportunity that continues to come into the market. We continue to see what we believe to be incredibly aggressive pricing, that continues to in our mind at least make a little bit more difficult to some of these opportunities that you're looking at. So we're staying active. We are in conversations on 2 or 3 opportunities right now that I hope will come together over the course of this year, and we're optimistic. But we're also staying discipline. And I think given the operating environment that we're in. And what appears to be the prospect stable interested environment going forward. The sector continues to attract a lot of capital. And we see values holding up quite well. If anything value is going up a little bit as the consequence of ' improving NOI performance. So we are - we're patient, and we got to remain that way. We've got delved into our exemptions this year. As you know call it, midpoint, about $100 million of dispositions, which we think is important to maintain through that process later this year. We've got the funding we've identified as it relates to what we do think we'll do and acquisitions. And development funding. So we got sort of the sources and uses of cash identified. Obviously, recycle of what we have in combination of dispositions in free cash flow. We certainly don't see equity this year, but I'm continue to be hopeful that the acquisition environment will become easier. And I think the day our focus is really built around, trying to ensure that we're going to create a stabilized NOI yield, that's accretive to our existing portfolio and create a return on capital that will be accretive to our shareholders versus what we expect to get out of the existing portfolio. So today's pricing, it continues to be a challenge. Having said that, we continue to roll in some of these technologies, some of these other operating focus items that we talked about. We think that that's going to continue to work in our favor to perhaps start to make some deals little bit more compelling as we go into the year. So deal is high, pricing is still aggressive.
Andrew Babin: I think on the disposition side. Remind me, are those likely to be just non-core assets or potential exit for some smaller markets? I just forget if that was mentioned on the last quarterly call?
Eric Bolton: We're taking a look at that right now. And trying to finalize that. But more likely they're not to going to be just - I mean we really asset on an asset-by-asset basis and look at situations where we think the go-forward after CapEx NOI growth rate is likely to show not the kind of growth trajectory consistent with the rest of the portfolio. And more often than not that translates into some of the over assets than we've had. We very much liked the footprint that you have, as I mentioned earlier. We like the broadly, the markets we're in. But given the history of the company and when you think about in some of the older assets probably are a few outlier, smaller market that you'll continue to see as exit from.
Andrew Babin: And then just one question for Al on the balance sheet. There is another three year secured mortgage executed during the quarter. I was curious whether that was on properties that was previously encumbered by secured debt? And also to I think last quarter, there was $300 million very short-term unsecured term loan. And I guess my question is, does the secured mortgage kind of directly replace that down? What are the moving parts there?
Albert Campbell: I wouldn't necessarily put it direct. But I think overall, if you think about what we had oulines last year is our financing plans. We had said we're going to about $600 million, $300 million more into 10-year, the be 30-year in the - I mean 30 year, I think if you look back last year, the market kind of collapse in terms of public bond financing in the late year. And so what we did is we moved everything here. We get saw an opportunity in the secured market to do 30 year. We did two deals and combined over $300 million at a very attractive rates. They are secured with seven properties, for this one we just did. And I think the similar number of properties for the first one. What I wouldn't directly rate them. I'm just saying, it's part of the long-term plan we were able to adjust and just continue to perform on pushing our duration of our maturities out a little further. It's a 30-year debt in there. But also not get too much secured debt as good. We obviously are very glad we've done that. We're glad to continue to increase our relationship with the partners we have there. But I think you'll see us manage our balance sheet, 90% of our NOI is still unencumbered, unsecured right now. And so you'll see as continue to protect that. But within proper do both types of that over time. So that was piece of the overall plan. On $3 million term loan, we'll likely - we'll pay it off this year. And as you've heard us talk about, we're now are thinking about part of our plants for this year's, may be potentially do another bond deal late in the year because the market's is wide open, and we handle that and to bring some future maturities for potentially.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel.
John Guinee: Few curiosity questions. Looks like you sold 1 acre of land on Peachtree Road in Atlanta for $9 million. Is it really only 1 acre? And one, is land worth $9 million in acre in Atlanta? And then also, any more color on the Popular Avenue office building.
Eric Bolton: John, this is Eric. Yes, is actually less than acre, but candidly, it's Peachtree road right next to Lenox Mall. I mean it's the heart of Buckhead. This is a residual piece of associated with the condominium development that are posted in many, many years ago. The site is incredibly tight, they get incredibly different the more difficult. We thought it to be multifamily on. And we were approach by someone who has a different plans for how they tend to use that land, and we worked it. We were cautiously optimistic, but frankly, skeptical that when get it done, therefore, it wasn't in our guidance. But we are most happy to get this done in the first quarter. So it is just what it's your reading. And it is a big win for us. The Popular Avenue we've been in the same office building for 24 years. And we - I had owned the building, it was part of the IPO. And we long outgrew that space and had our corporate staff out into two different locations for the last 5 years. And so we finally had an opportunity to get everyone back together. And a new building, and the post proximity to location we just running office space. But we sold it and rather use that capital in apartments. So we've been in it for a long time and Glad to be gone.
John Guinee: Okay. And then the second question. Sync36 in Denver, it looks like Phase 1 cost you about 280,000 unit, but the budget for Sync Phase 2 is about $310,000 a unit. Did the cost really go up 10% that quickly? Or is there some allocation things we should think about?
Eric Bolton: It was really - more - no, cost had not gone up that much. That was really there was some allocation. When we negotiated the transaction with the developer, they had this one adjacent piece that has some unique aspects to it that created the cost umbers which you're seeing. But...
Albert Campbell: It's also a lower of number of units that we view the project as a whole. So you kind of have to put them together to think about that. And so when we underwrote it, we underwrite it together. And whole project is when in line with our expectations and our plants. And so it's allocation thing, but in total, it works well.
John Guinee: Is it a podium or a draft?
Eric Bolton: It's actually a surface park product.
John Guinee: Wow. For $300,000 a unit? Okay.
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean...
Albert Campbell: That's only - that's a small - the second one is of small number of unit, the first stage is much largest one. When you blend it down, you're going to be under $300,000.
Eric Bolton: But you also - that's why Denver - it's normal for Denver. You look at a cost per unit and the market like Denver, and that's pretty routine.
Albert Campbell: For a high-quality products.
Eric Bolton: Yes.
John Guinee: Surface parked up [ph].
Eric Bolton: Yes.
Albert Campbell: Yes.
Operator: And our next question comes from Buck Horne from Raymond James.
Buck Horne: I just wanted to go back to guidance for just a second, Al, if I could. I guess you so - we raised the guidance therapeutic $0.08 for the noncash gain on the land sale. But I think there was also, you mentioned that offsetting $0.03 drag from just the timing of the transaction activity. Could you just - can you elaborate on just the moving parts there and just the changes on the timing of acquisition dispositions that drove that change to the guidance?
Albert Campbell: Yes, absolutely, Buck. That's a good question. I think so outperform the first quarter was $0.11 per share. And so we just put that performance into obviously, role that in as performance. So what we talked about was on the back part of the year we did have some changes to our transactions and into our that plans, that costs us $0.03 per share. So net that out as $0.08, and I'll give you the details of that as about $0.01 for, I talked about just a minute ago, we're planning on potentially doing another debt deal later in the year to take care some of may be our future financing as well as paid our term loan, that we talked about earlier. We also had $0.01 per share of earnest money forfeiture from that land sale that we talked about. I mean we had actually as we talked about, didn't have it in our guidance because we were really uncertain about the closing, and we had actually included in our plans that likely would fall apart and we could get the earnest money forfeited. So that's about $0.01 per share actually that comes out in the back part of the year. And then the remaining penny is just transaction timing, acquisition disposition plan, we continue to adjust those as we're selecting properties and we see clearly the deals we may buy in the year. So costs us about $0.01. So together, that's a $0.03. We beat $0.11 in the first quarter and took $0.03 out of those things.
Buck Horne: Got you. That's really helpful. And secondly, just looking at some of the activity and the added development in the Phoenix area. Looks like you're trying to enhance or considering enhancing the presence of the Southwest a little bit further. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about your current scale and the Phoenix marketplace or if you is there anything else you want to do to optimize the scale there. Over and would you consider reentering the market like Las Vegas if the writing came along?
Eric Bolton: Buck, this is Eric. I would tell you, I mean, we like Phoenix a lot. And I think that both Phoenix and Denver continue to have very a promising outlook over the next, call it, 10, 15 years. I think both of these markets are much more affordable than what you see on some of the West Coast markets. I think both markets are continuing to attract large pop growth. And population growth, migration trends. So we are very comfortable continue to scale up our presence in the Phoenix market, as well as obviously, in the Denver market as well. Vegas is a little bit of a different story I think. I mean we like very much the 2 properties that we have there. They're doing great. That's a market that is doing pretty well right now. I don't see that economy as probably diversified as I do at Phoenix and in Denver. Vegas obviously is - I have lot of entertainment employment base as well as military that drives a lot of it. And you're seeing some other back office costs. I think you get the wage growth in that market like you to in Denver or Phoenix. So I wouldn't think that you'll see US scale up in that particular market in Vegas. But the other 2 for sure, we would.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Pawlowski WITH Green Street Advisors.
John Pawlowski: Tom or Al, could you remind us what the left - the revenue left for full year '19 is from, just THE learning on redevelopments?
Albert Campbell: Earnings on redevelopment? So redevelopment is typically 25 to 50 basis points in our - in any year in our program as this year is consistent with what it was last year. So I'd probably give them 25, 35 basis points...
Eric Bolton: I mean that would be what it was, if we took it out. But since it is similar to what we did last year, it's not part of...
Albert Campbell: I think is that built-in impacted that over time, if that's what you're asking, John, I think that's what we would say it is.
Eric Bolton: On year-over-year basis, we've been pretty steady at the same number of unit...
Albert Campbell: Same program.
Eric Bolton: The year-over-year change is really not meaningful at all. But the overall impact on the permanent basis is the 25, 35 basis points.
Albert Campbell: Before wrapping the program up, it would be - in this year, it'd be at the higher end of that. But we've had this consistent number this year and last year. We did ramp up in last year some pretty pre-post-merger. But what we would expect as built in.
John Pawlowski: The question would be clear is, if you didn't do any redevelopments in the last few years, how much lower would 20...
Albert Campbell: 25 basis points. 25 to 30. That's kind of built in on an recurring - on 'an ongoing basis.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And that kind of probably ramps next year a bit?
Albert Campbell: No. I think - I mean I would only ramp if we ramped our program up next year. I think right now we expect to do about the same number of units next year that we did last year and the previous year. So the best part of the contribution from that program. Now we certainly - will helpful if we have continued pricing performance and other things. But that's from the reduced development program specifically that we expect next year.
John Pawlowski: Okay. And then, Tom, I was hoping you could give some color on the demand side of the equation as Houston heading in peak leasing season. It's tough to just entangle what's organic structural improvement on market versus just the market is still just coming out of the basement of it. So how bullish or concerned or kind of meddling in feelings do you have in Houston right now?
Thomas Grimes: I would say, I mean, they're jobs to completion are still in a healthy range at 9 to 1. I would expect Houston to still be steady from a growth standpoint, John. But I don't think we'll see the blended rate growth change that we saw between 2017 at '18. Certainly, one of our more stable and steady markets. But I think it was like a 800 basis points change in blended rents last year, and that will moderate to more normal.
John Pawlowski: So does it stay in that mid-4% revenue growth range in next few years?
Thomas Grimes: So far blended's hung right in there.
Operator: And it does appear that there are no further questions over the phone at this time. I would like to go ahead and turn it back to the speakers for any closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us and appreciate you being on the call. We'll see most of you at NAREIT in a few weeks. So Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the companies will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a remainder this conference is being recorded today January 31, 2019. I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. Please go ahead, sir.
Timothy Argo: Thank you, Denise and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning I would like to point out that as part of the discussion company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website. During this call we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim and good morning. We wrapped up 2018 slightly ahead of where we expected with FFO per share of $6.06 per share excluding the non-cash mark-to-market accounting adjustment related to the preferred shares. We're encouraged with our fourth quarter results as a positive trends and rent growth and high occupancy are clearly evident while the new supply pipeline in several markets will challenge near-term rent growth. We're encouraged with the continued strong demand for apartment housing across our markets. Our portfolio continues to benefit from strong job growth and overall high demand for apartment housing. We continue to believe that new supply pressure in 2019 will remain elevated but down slightly from 2018. Tom will cover more details concerning our higher concentration markets, but broadly when weighted our market exposures by percentage of NOI and refining the analysis to neighborhood-specific assessments of new supply, our latest update is very similar to the information we shared at NAREIT in November. In summary, we expect 48% of our portfolios' market exposure will show some level of improvement in 2019 with lower supply as compared to prior year. 44% of our market exposure is expected to see slightly higher levels of new delivery in 2019. And 8% of the portfolio exposure will see current year deliveries in line with prior year new deliveries. Assuming the demand side equation remains strong we expect the positive pricing momentum we've seen over the back half of 2018 to continue through calendar year 2019. As we continue to work through the later stages of the current cycle we do expect to see developers get a little more aggressive with their lease-up tactics and have dialed that into our expectations for 2019. With the goal of maximizing long-term revenue results we remain focused on continuing to capture the encouraging trends in rent growth. Given where we are in the cycle, we expect that it might come at the cost of a low current occupancy, but let me be clear about this. As Al, will outline in his comments we do expect to post strong occupancy in 2019 of 95.9% average daily occupancy throughout the year which represents only a slight 20 basis point moderation from the record high 96.1% average daily occupancy throughout 2018. As commented in our third quarter earnings release our merger integration activities are now complete. We're very pleased with the results over the last couple of years in harvesting the expense synergies we had previously identified surrounding property level operating expenses and G&A overhead costs. We do expect to see year-over-year growth and expenses begin to normalize in 2019. As expected the opportunities on the revenue side of the equation surrounding various revenue management practices and significant redevelopment opportunities within the legacy Post portfolio have been slower to capture than the expense side given the new supply pressures in a number of markets. However, despite this pressure the improving pricing trends within the legacy Post portfolio over the past couple of quarters are encouraging. And in addition we will be executing on our higher number of redeveloped opportunities this year within that part of the portfolio. Our four projects in lease-up continue to become increasingly productive and in line with our expectations. We expect to see all four properties stabilize over the course of this year. We expect to see our new development projects in Raleigh and Denver begin initial leasing and occupancy over the back half of this year with our newest project in the Frisco submarket of North Dallas coming online early next year. We started a new expansion project at our Copper Ridge community in North Fort Worth this month on existing owned land. At this point, we're also working pre-development at new development projects in Phoenix, Denver, Orlando and Houston that were expect to start later this year. In summary, we're encouraged with the continued momentum in pricing that we're capturing despite the new supply headwinds in several of our larger markets. We believe our portfolio focused on the strong job growth Sunbelt region diversified across markets submarkets and price points appealing to the largest segments of the real markets continue to position MAA for solid performance over the full real estate cycle. Our balance sheet is in a strong position and certainly able to support the external growth opportunities we're currently executing on, in any others that may emerge. After two years of merger activities that are now complete our platform is stable and stronger. We look forward to the performance opportunities in 2019. I'm going to turn the call over to Tom now.
Thomas Grimes: Thank you, Eric and good morning, everyone. Our operating performance for the fourth quarter came in as expected with building momentum in rent growth, continued strong average daily occupancy and improving trends that set us up well for 2019. The results of the integration work on the operating platform were evident in our leasing momentum during the quarter. We saw blended lease-over-lease performance of the combined portfolio grow by 1.6% in the fourth quarter which is 150 basis points higher than the same time last year. Average daily occupancy remained strong at 96.1%, as a result of the steady positive trend and blended pricing we saw revenues buck seasonal trends and they accelerated from 2% in the third quarter to 2.3% in the fourth quarter. All elevated supply levels have pressured rent growth in several of our markets particularly Dallas and Austin. We're still seeing good revenue growth in a number of our other markets. Among our highest concentration markets Phoenix, Richmond, Tampa and Orlando are our strongest revenue growth markets. Expense performance was steady for the fourth quarter at 3%. This includes 5.8% growth in real estate taxes which was partially offset by reductions in building repair and maintenance as well as marketing. For the year our total expense growth was just 2%, while we've captured the scale and labor opportunities available during this merger, we still expect to continue our disciplined expense practices. Our annual operating expense growth rate since 2012 has been just 2.4% well below the sector average. The favorable trends continued into January. All pricing indicators are trending ahead of last year. Currently, same-store January blended lease-over-lease rates are up a healthy 3.1% which is 260 basis points better than January of last year. Average daily occupancy for the month is a strong 96%. Our 60-day exposure which represents all vacant units and move-out notices for a 60-day period is a low 7.2%. We are well-positioned for 2019. Our focus on customer service and retention coupled with social trends supporting steady renter demand continued to drop down resident turnover. Move-outs for the overall same-store portfolio were down 7% for the quarter. Move-outs to homebuying and move-outs to home renting were down 5% and 12%, respectively. On a rolling 12-month basis, turnover was at historic low of 48.5%. This level of turnover was achieved while increasing renewal rents, at notable 6.1%. On the redevelopment front, in the fourth quarter we completed 1,600 units which brought us to a total of 8,200 unit interior upgrades for the year. For 2019, we again expect to complete close to 8000 unit interior upgrades. As a reminder, on average we spent $6,100 per unit and charge an additional 11% in rent which generates a year one cash-on-cash return in excess of 20%. Our total redevelopment pipeline now stands in the neighborhood of 17,500 to 20,500 units. Our active lease-up communities, Sync36 and Post River North in Denver, Post Centennial Park in Atlanta and Phase two of 1201 Midtown and Mount Pleasant – in the Mount Pleasant submarket of Charleston are all leasing up in line with expectations. Looking forward as Eric mentioned our overall supply in our markets is expected to improve modestly in 2019. We take the third-party data and crosscheck this supply data with our own asset-by-asset information. Performance by market will vary but at this point we believe overall we will see some decline in deliveries. Our Dallas and Austin assets are expected to remain challenging with supplier levels continuing in the 3% to 4% of inventory range. We expect Charlotte to soften as supply picks up near our assets. We expect the strength in Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa and Phoenix to continue as all currently show supply decreasing. We're pleased to have the merger integration wrapped up and greatly appreciate the tireless efforts of our associates as we retool the company over the last two years. We are starting 2019 in a much better position than 2018 and we look forward to the coming year. Al?
Albert Campbell: Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's fourth quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally on the key components of our initial guidance for 2019. FFO for the fourth quarter was $1.55 per share which included $0.02 per share of non-cash expense related to the accounting adjustment of preferred shares acquired during the Post merger. Excluding this adjustment our FFO per share for the fourth quarter was a penny above the midpoint of our prior guidance with majority of this outperformance produced by favorable interest expense during the quarter. Our overall same-store performance for the fourth quarter is in line with our expectations as continued pricing momentum produced a 2.3% year-over-year growth and total revenues which accelerated as Tom mentioned are from the 2% in the third quarter. Overall blended lease pricing growth combined new and renewal pricing finished the year, the full year of 2.5% which was 80 basis points above the prior year. Same-store expense growth of 3% for the fourth quarter was primarily driven by a 5.8% growth in real estate tax expense which represents 36% of total same-store operating expenses as pressure late in there from certain municipalities primarily Atlanta and Dallas impacted in fourth quarter. And for the full year real estate tax expense grew 4.2% as compared to our initial guidance of 3.5% to 4.5% for the year. During the fourth quarter we completed construction of one development community an expansion community a, phase of community in Charleston which leads to three committees undeveloped – under development at year-end with a total projected cost of $118.5 million of which about $87.5 million remain to be funding as of year-end. We also acquired two land parcels during the fourth quarter, one in Denver and one in Houston both related to planned new development projects expected to begin during 2019. Given our current pipeline and planned new projects we expect total construction funding to increase in 2019 ranging between $100 million and $150 million. We continue to expect NOI yields of 6% to 6.5% on average from our development portfolio once they're completed and fully stabilized. During the fourth quarter we had two communities completely leased up and reached stabilization which we measure as 90% occupancy for greater than 90 days. And we saw four communities in lease-up at year-end including the recently completed community we mentioned earlier. Average occupancy for our lease-up portfolio ended the year at 62.4%. As Tom mentioned, leasing has gone well for the group and we expect growing earnings contribution during 2019 and to the 2020 as two of these communities are projected to stabilize in the first half of the year and the final two stabilizing later in the year. Our balance sheet remains in great shape at year-end. During the fourth quarter we had a fairly significant amount of financing activity as we paid off the final $80 million of Fannie Mae secured credit facility which matured in December and additional $530 million of secured mortgages maturing in early 2019. Given the volatility of the credit markets during the fourth quarter we revised our financing plans and entered a 30-year fixed-rate secured mortgage for $172 million and a $300 million variable-rate unsecured six-month term loan which we expect to replace in 2019 with additional fixed-rate financing. At the end of the year, we had over $490 million of combined cash capacity under our credit facility. Our leverage as defined by our bond covenants was only 32.6%, while our net debt-to-recurring EBITDAre was just below 5x. Finally, we are providing initial earnings guidance for 2019 with the release which is detailed in our supplemental information package. We're providing guidance for net income per diluted common share which is reconciled to FFO and AFFO per share in supplement. We're also providing guidance and other key business metrics expected to drive performance in 2019. Also, though we do expect to continue volatility in our NAREIT reported FFO results related to the non-cash accounting adjustment on the preferred shares, we did not include the adjustments in our forecast as these are both non-cash and really impractical to predict. Net income per diluted common shares projected to be $2.11 to $2.35 for the full-year 2019. FFO is projected to be $6.03 to $6.27, or $6.15 at the midpoint. AFFO is projected to be $5.39 to $5.63 per share, or $5.51 at the midpoint. The main driver of full-year 2019 performance is our same-store guidance. Revenue growth projected to be 2.3% at the midpoint is based on continued strong average daily occupancy of 95.9% at the midpoint. And projected average blended rent pricing which is new leases and renewals combined of 2.7% for the year, which is a modest improvement over 2018. We expect operating expenses to grow at 3.1% at the midpoint coming off of two years of very low expense growth. We expect real estate taxes to continue to produce the most pressure increasing $4.25 at the midpoint. And this expected same-store revenue and operating expense performance produces NOI growth of 1.8% at the midpoint. We expect the acquisition environment to remain competitive. We project total acquisition volume for 2019 to range between $125 million and $175 million and to consist primarily of non-stabilized deals. We also plan to resume our portfolio recycling efforts projected disposition volume of $75 million to $125 million likely closing in the second half of the year. We expect the end of 2019 with our leverage near current levels as a percentage of gross assets producing an average effective interest rate of 3.9% or 4.1%, which is about 20 basis points above the prior year at the midpoint which represents $0.08 per share impact to our earnings. A portion of this projected increase is related to the continued impact of rising short-term interest rates with the remaining portion primarily due to the declining mark-to-market adjustment related to the debt acquired from Colonial and Post mergers as the favorable fair market value adjustments from both mergers essentially burned off during 2018. Our guidance also assumes total overhead cost which we included G&A and property management expenses combined will range between $96.5 million and $98.5 million, reflecting more normalized run rate for 2019 which includes a full-year carry of investments we made in our people, facilities, systems and web presence to improve our operating platform capabilities, scalability, our cybersecurity with all of this which was planned as part of the merger integration efforts. Our total overhead cost for 2018 were actually below our original estimates for the year and actually declined from 2017 primarily due to timing of some of these planned investments and the impact of several non-recurring items during the year, which impacted legal, casualty insurance and medical insurance policies for the year. We expect our total overhead growth for the longer term to be around 5% annually which is in line with the sector average. That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So operator, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go ahead and take our first question from Trent from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Trent Trujillo: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions.
Eric Bolton: Hi, Trent.
Trent Trujillo: Good morning. You called out supply pressures in Austin, Charlotte plus Dallas and Atlanta continue to see high levels of permitting new supply. And very much thank you for breaking out your NOIs into higher and lower and similar supply buckets for 2019. But how can you be confident in your ability to assert pricing power and show same-store revenue acceleration at the aggregate level, if these pressures persist in your largest markets? And I guess another way of saying this, can you maybe talk about the magnitude of supply increases versus the magnitude of decline?
Eric Bolton: Let me start. Trent, this is Eric and Tom can give you some more specifics. I mean, our confidence if you will as it pertains to 2019 rent growth despite the supply pressures is really based in what we see as continued very strong demand. And we see no evidence that the demand side of the equation is weakening. We continue to see very low move-out occurring and the job growth numbers continue to be encouraging. So with that level of demand when we start looking at our particular locations and as Tom mentioned in his call we take the AXIO data and other sort of macro level data and we do a deep dive with it, into specific neighborhoods and so forth where we're located. And ultimately we do see this mix of roughly 48% of the portfolio suggesting slightly lower supply pressure 44% slightly higher and about 8% being pretty consistent, but really the confidence that we have is really driven by the demand side of the equation. As long as that's there, we think the rent trends that we're seeing are going to continue to hold up. One other thing I'll add, I do believe that as we get later in the cycle that developers may get evermore aggressive with some of their lease-up practices in an effort to get little quicker. And that's what really – we haven't seen any evidence of that yet, but I think it's the reasonable to expect that it may come in certain areas. And that really led us to introduce the notion that, we'll maintain strong occupancy, but it may not be quite at 96.1% that we did in 2018. We believe that really to protect long-term revenue growth that – rent growth really matters and we wanted to continue to capture that rent growth trend that we're seeing. We think we'll do so, and to counter the cost of a little occupancy in 2019, we're, okay with that. We think that's a right long-term play to make.
Thomas Grimes: All right. And then just underlying trend, the confidence on the revenue side, the rent trends I'll touch on for Q4 and January just to put those in perspective for first quarter blended rents increase was 45 basis points better than last year. And second quarter was 100 basis points better, third quarter 60 basis points, fourth quarter 150 basis points. In January, 260 basis points. So we feel good about the underlying results that we're seeing on the pricing trends.
Trent Trujillo: Okay. That's great color. Thank you very much. As it relates to the transaction market on the third quarter call, Eric you mentioned that you're seeing perhaps some early indications that deal flow might come back to you as things were starting to fray a little bit. It may have been very preliminary, but your guidance does call for some lease-up acquisitions and you stated significant capacity on your balance sheet. So can you maybe give us an update on how you're viewing the transaction market, the deal flow? What opportunities are out there? What are you looking at? And how competitive it is to find accretive deal that meets your standards at this time?
Eric Bolton: So, it's still very, very competitive. As you may know, I mean, the market tends to take a little bit of a breather during the very early part of the year. I know our transaction team is out at the Nashville Housing Conference for a broker event. It has become almost annual meeting right now. And they usually come back with a lot of leads if you will, a lot of opportunities. I know they're talking about this week. There continues to be just a high level of interest by private capital in the space. So we fully expect that this next year 2019 will be as competitive as what we saw in 2018. But having said that, again, we're just getting later in the cycle, and I think that some of the lease-up properties will perhaps run into a little bit more headwind than what they may have experienced in 2018, and as a consequence of that we're hopeful that, that may create a little pressure which create some better buying opportunities for us. We are going to remain disciplined but we continue to have hope that the 2019 is going to deliver a few more opportunities. I mean, the volume is still high, but we're going to continue to remain optimistic about 2019 opportunities.
Trent Trujillo: All right. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it.
Eric Bolton: You bet.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our next question from Nick from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. It's been two years, but now that the integration with the Post is complete, have you seen any difference in same-store growth and margins in 2019 between the two portfolios?
Thomas Grimes: Yes. Hey, Nick. This is Tom. What we're really seeing – in Mid-America is $2.6 and portfolio to Post is $1.7. What to me is most interesting is the rate of acceleration on the Post side which was second quarter $0.4 and now $0.7 – $1.7. That's on the revenue growth side.
Eric Bolton: Yes, what I would say Nick is that, we saw incredible opportunities that we harvested in the first two years on the expense side of the equation as we renegotiated contracts and got some very huge benefits of scale that we're able to bring to the Post portfolio on the expense side as well as sort of retooling some of the practices in turn activities and with labor cost, and that's what really fueled some pretty low year-over-year expense growth that we've had for the last two years not only – and particularly in the Post portfolio, but in aggregate, the overall MAA portfolio had pretty strong expense performance, but what's been slower to come online has been the opportunities on the revenue side, and a lot of that is a function of really three things. First of all you've got a – there's some training and then there's some people things that you have to sort of get stabilize and get right and that takes a little time. Two, the market conditions as a function of higher supply levels have been more pressuring the Post locations which is – we're battling that. And then, a third we have to just basically get into the revenue management practices. And as you know particularly when the opportunity lies in the area of rent growth it takes time for that momentum to build. You have to go through a full leasing cycle and reprice portfolio and bring all of the training and all of the revenue practices together. And as what Tom is alluding to there which gives us a lot of encouragement is, the improving pricing trends that we're seeing out of the legacy Post portfolio are far superior than what we're seeing on the MAA portfolio. So it does suggest us that we're going to see continued momentum. And then as I mentioned in my comments earlier too, next year we'll be redeveloping more of the Post portfolio as a percentage of what we do in terms of overall redevelopment. So, I think we're going to continue to see the momentum and the opportunities on the revenue side come together more so over the next couple of years.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. And then just on the total overhead, obviously up pretty meaningfully over 2018. Can you walk through the main drivers of that? And then is this 2019 guidance a good baseline going forward? Or are there any onetime items in there?
Albert Campbell: Hey, Nick. This is Al. I can walk you through that, and I think 2019 certainly compared to 2018 was a fairly significant increase, but it has a lot to do really with some activity in 2018 and there was a little bit of noise still in the year relates to some of the things going on. So if you look at 2018 it actually declined from 2017 and was a little bit lower than what we had put out initially in our guidance early on in the year, only for couple of reasons. One, as we're making investments for an integration and for the platform that we knew that we're going to put together we some of those came later, than we expected as we wanted to get deeper into the project into the process and really zero – on exactly what we wanted, and what we wanted to invest in to make our platform and what we wanted to be in the future. So 2018 was lower, 2019 you feel the full run rate of that and then we had some onetime items in 2018, some cost that are due and payable, that won't recur in 2019 and some of the insurance and workers' comp and real insurance and medical insurance, since our medical costs were been lower. We're glad to have that – we don't think that will repeat in 2019. So what I will say is 2019 is a fairly large increase. We would expect as you move to 2020, we have a more modest increase. We think that 2019 is a full-year run rate of our platform that we expect and I think if you look at our three-year windows, I talked about the decline in 2018, rise in 2019 and a more modest rise in 2020. We expect it to be in line with the long-term sector average of 5% to 6%. That's how we built it.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. It’s very helpful.
Operator: We'll go ahead and take the next question from Austin from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning. You guys mentioned you started out the year with blended lease rates of over 3% in January, but the average, I think you're assuming for the full year is 2.7%. So just curious what leads you to believe that lease rates will moderate later into the year?
Eric Bolton: I'll start with that and Tom can jump in. I think one of the things going on is, as you remember we had some pretty favorable comparison on some leasing activity late last year. Fourth quarter last year is when it really got challenging before. Since, I think some of the new leases we're putting on and as we move into January, are really strong comparisons. I think as we move into the year as Tom will say that that may moderate somewhat, but we feel good that we've got…
Thomas Grimes: No. Absolutely that sort of trend that I rattled off a little bit earlier we'll have to start comparing to that. And so we've got – the comparisons we've got good opportunity first part of the year, but don't expect to keep 3.1 all the way through.
Austin Wurschmidt: Is that a function? I understand that, that from a spread perspective that the spreads become more difficult, but from an absolute level I guess, is it just your, you are cautious to push rent on the same tenant two years in a row at a consistent level or in order to kind of, in order to sustain occupancy or I guess, I don't fully understand the comp discussion in a stable supply environment. I would think maybe you could still push I guess at a similar rate. So can you just dive in a little bit there?
Thomas Grimes: I mean, on the same resident back-to-back that's on the renewal side, and renewals are strengthening, and I feel very comfortable with that in the 6% to 7% range, right now – right now, the variable is on the new lease rates and we do – we think we will have good performance there just not the same gap that we had prior.
Eric Bolton: But also adding to that, we certainly intend and expect that our ability to push rents in 2019 will be comparable to what we did in 2018. We don't see any reason to suggest that we're going to have to back off. And the only thing that is different if you will in 2019 versus 2018 is that we think as we continue that same level of push on pricing as we get later in the cycle and we get – I think most of the information I've seen for AXIO and others suggest that the – we've got the peak in deliveries in Q2 rather than start of the spring leasing season. It may come at the cost that, that pushing on pricing may come at the cost of a little bit of a give up on occupancy. And we just think it's important to be willing to make that trade-off right now, in order to sort of protect the long-term revenue goals that we have. So, but to answer your question, no we absolutely don't believe we're going to need to back off on, pushing on the rents. It's just that the prior year comparisons that we're comparing against are just a little harder as we get later in the year.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. And then as far as the peaking in the second quarter, I mean, what have you seen as far as construction delays in your markets? Are you continuing to see them or have they started to slow a bit?
Eric Bolton: Yes, about – all I can tell you is I'm sure construction delays will continue. I think there's been no evidence whatsoever that the labor issues have gotten any easier and that typically is what's causing a lot of the delays to occur. The information that I alluded to that we saw from AXIO suggesting that it would peak in Q2. I fully expect that to slide a little bit into Q3. So I don't know at this point, something we're watching very, very closely, but I wouldn't fully expect some of these projects to slip a little bit over the course of the year.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. Thanks. And just last one, I'm just curious if you – in your forecast when do you see supply growth in your submarkets in Dallas begin to moderate?
Thomas Grimes: We're seeing some early signs that it may moderate late in the year, but I think Dallas is going to be challenging for the pretty much for the full-year. Its way too early to call the end on that one and we will be challenging particularly the first two quarters of the year.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our next question from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. On your occupancy guidance for the year, I relate it's only 20 basis points but do you believe as far as the turnover rate will increase during the year? Or it'll take longer to lease-up vacant units or a combination of both?
Eric Bolton: It's hard to know. I would say likely, I would think more likely it's going to come primarily through, just slightly higher average number of days vacancy between turns. I think that for all the reasons, Tom alluded to the retention rate and the lower turnover that we're seeing I suspect is going to continue to be low. I mean, the number one reason people leave us is because of some sort of change in their employment status and absent some sort of slowdown in the job market which we don't anticipate. I don't think we're going to see more pressure on that front. And then when you look at the number two reason, people leave us is to go buy a house. That seems to not becoming any worse for sure maybe even slightly better. So as a consequence of that I think that I'm optimistic that the turnover component remains fairly static in 2019 relative to 2018. We just think that some of these lease-up projects will get a little bit more aggressive. We – as I mentioned are committed to holding as much as we can, the trend and we think we can on rent growth. And we think that it may require a little bit of concession on some of the days vacancy between turns on new move-ins. And, we think that's the right trade-off to make right now in order to protect the strong rent growth improvement that we're seeing take place, and again, looking to capture a very strong average daily occupancy of 95.9%, I mean that's pretty darn strong and we think we'll do that this year.
John Kim: I apologize, if I missed this or if you've already answered this but, where do you think renewals will be this year versus 6% last year?
Thomas Grimes: I won't think we would be between 5.5% and 6.5% for the year trending a little higher than that in January, but I would feel comfortable in the 5.5% to 6.5% range.
John Kim: Okay. On the expense side with tax increases of $4.25, overhead cost going up 5%, I realize some of that in G&A, is 3% same-store expense growth is the new norm – for the foreseeable future?
Albert Campbell: I mean, I think if you look at the, John, this is Al, if you look at our long-term average, it's close to 2.5%. I think the real estate tax, I think what we have gone in the last couple of years is really good performance for two years, 2% on average last couple of years driven by reductions in repair and maintenance and marketing some of the areas where we're able to capture strong synergies from our deals and we had a tax pressure offsetting that somewhat. We have about 5% growth in real estate taxes over those two years and still where we put a 2% total expense growth – forward. So I think going forward what you'll see is personnel – if those other lines will be under control but more close to normal level of growth. Personnel 2% to 2.5%, repair and maintenance closer to 3%. Modest growth in other lines and taxes being one-third of your cost in the fourth quarter range producing the majority of…
Eric Bolton: One way of looking at it is that, even if you think about real estate taxes comprising the large percentage of our overall tax expense base that growth rate almost by the math implies a lower, less than 3% growth rate on all of the other line items. And so I think that the new norm is my guess is going to be closer to 3%. In any given year a lot of it is going to be up or down as a consequence of real estate taxes.
Albert Campbell: And we will help over time, a couple of years real state in Texas being to moderate, but right now there's a lot of pressure from Texas, Georgia and not surprisingly…
Eric Bolton: The low cap rate environment fueling that.
John Kim: Got it. Okay. And then on your market commentary and as far as where you're seeing the greater supply pressure, back in November NAREIT, you guys are saying Austin, Charlotte and DC were the three major markets. It looks like Dallas has moved up into the bucket. I'm wondering what changed in the last couple of months with Dallas? And also if D.C. is still on market, we see how they will display.
Eric Bolton: Yes, I mean D.C. is still a market in the elevated bucket. And then Dallas, just sort of – Dallas is very close to even, in some looks it is slightly higher, in others its slightly lower but John I would just expect it to be pressured about the same as next year.
Thomas Grimes: Yes, I think, John we would say Dallas is still kind of at the same bucket, but its still, it's elevated both years but not necessarily getting way better or way worse.
John Kim: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Robert Stevenson: Thank you. Tom, which markets have the widest spend of likely same-store revenue outcomes when you did your budgeting for 2019?
Thomas Grimes: Meaning where do I think our strongest markets will be and where do our weakest? Or within the market which has the largest delta between assets?
Robert Stevenson: The largest delta between, basically the up end – the top end of the range and the bottom end of the range. I assume that Al made to pick the middle or somewhere below the middle or from a conservative basis in most of your markets when you were going through from an earning standpoint. But, like which markets are most likely to have a surprise to the top end or down side in 2019 relative to where you guys set the median expectation?
Thomas Grimes: Yes. And then it's sort of, what I'll tell you is that comes down maybe to the change in the back half of the year, and I would tell you that Charlotte were relatively strong right now. And – but it is we're expecting some supply there especially later and so that may change over time, and then Nashville, it looks like, it's maybe better later half of the year but it's challenging – very challenging right now.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then the 8,000 units you expect to renovate this year, are these all going to be on terms? Or are you going to take some units out of service?
Thomas Grimes: They will all be on terms.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then lastly for me, Al what's the known non-cash or non-recurring things impacting FFO in 2019?
Albert Campbell: Non-cash Rob? It's a much cleaner year in 2019. The fair market value of the desk is pretty much burned off. You would probably have the preferred but you know what, we didn't not put that in our forecast, because it's just almost impossible, mostly impossible to predict. But those are the key non-cash items in 2019. I think, as the good news as we've had – the bad news is we've had a good bit of noise over the last few years for some of those items Rob. But I think as we move forward 2019 - 2020 beyond we're very glad to be in more stable years with less of that noise and should have more consistent growth production.
Eric Bolton: I'll add one point Rob. Absent, anything in the preferred which is non-cash was about $500,000 or so less than that debt mark-to-market non-cash and that's pretty much…
Albert Campbell: Virtually gone.
Eric Bolton: That's pretty much it.
Albert Campbell: Yes.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. So NAREIT, normalized the core FFO should be, at this point in the year you guys think would be fairly consistent but for anything that happens on a preferred and that $500,000 of debt?
Albert Campbell: That's right. Excluding the preferred we think those numbers will be very close.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: And we’ll go ahead and take our next question from Drew Babin from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Drew Babin: Hey, good morning.
Eric Bolton: Hey Drew. Good morning.
Drew Babin: With regard to Dallas Atlanta and Charlotte kind of being your three biggest markets those are the three markets where you had a lot of Post Legacy assets would you say the lease-over-lease blended pricing expectations are above the midpoint of the two to three range for the year for those three markets? I mean, if not, what in the case of Dallas, I would assume they might be lower. How this uptown, stack up versus the Northern suburban assets where I know there's a lot of supply kind of out in Frisco and Plano now?
Thomas Grimes: Yes. No they're lower, and Dallas as you mentioned uptown it's under pressure. But Frisco, Plano and McKinney are all seeing their fair share as well. Atlanta and Charlotte a little bit different. Inside, the perimeter Atlanta, outside the perimeter Atlanta two different markets. We're very strong outside the perimeter end market in Atlanta and the majority of the headwinds that we have on supply are Peachtree Road, Midtown, Downtown and it really inner loop and in Charlotte it's sort of a similar picture where Uptown/Downtown South Church area seeing a little bit more supply and the suburb is broadly stronger. So Dallas, a little bit wider spread and it's more targeted in the Atlanta and Charlotte markets.
Drew Babin: Okay. And we would say, the Post legacy assets if you kind of broke those out with some of the redevelopments and renovations, would you say that those assets are doing better than kind of the $2.7 at midpoint on that lease-over-lease?
Thomas Grimes: Yes, the number of renovations that we have done thus far on the Post side of things, Drew is not enough to really impact that just yet. It's building and it will come, but those Post Properties are facing a little bit uphill battle on the supply right in their backyard.
Drew Babin: Okay, that's helpful. And one question for Al, just on the line balance, I think we're still over $500 million at the end of the year. And I'm not sure if that includes the turmoil or not, but as you look out to maybe more permanently finance that, what are the options on the table and guidance? If we could start with that, I have a follow-up.
Albert Campbell: Right, actually, no, the term loan is not in our line of credit outstanding balance Drew. It's a good point. Just – in context we paid off about over $600 million – just over $600 million of debt in the – late in the year as we talked about and we had a plan as we talked about a few quarters to do bond, it will active in the bond market late in the year but the market volatility really causes us to be little more patient there and so we talked about doing $600 million maybe some long-term tenure and some normal tenure. So what we did, we revised our plans a little bit and did a little bit of a secured 30-year behind of $172 million we saw and we put $300 million term loan which is – it was short-term term loan which we would expect to be active in the bond markets only here to replace that. So I think in going forward what you should see is – you should expect in your model is a bond deal in the first part of the year replacing that $300 million and maybe a couple of hundred million more of debt whether it will be opportunistic whether it's bond, whether it's mortgage – secured mortgage averaging about 4.5% rates what we have in the forecast for us for the year. So, markets will give us what they give us and that's what we've dialed in.
Drew Babin: Okay. And with the 30-year mortgage you did in the fourth quarter what was the rate benefit of doing that versus the 30-year unsecured? And then as you look out to this year, is the 30-year unsecured bond is still on the table?
Albert Campbell: Yes, absolutely. One of the interesting things we saw late in the year was, doing a 30-year bond as markets got volatile, the spreads really widened on that as you'd expect the perceived risk, but on the secured market which is a more of private market, it was much tighter, and so we had 4.4% rate on that all-in which is well below we could've gotten the bond even when things were fairly stable. So I think that was good execution. We don't – we obviously don't want to – we want to protect our balance sheet. We want to get too much secured debt, but you could see use a little bit more because we have about 8% of our assets are encumbered right now, so it's very, very low. So we could do a little bit more. So you may see us next year do a little bit more of that if the rates are good and then have a bond deal in the $300 million to $400 million range.
Drew Babin: Okay, great. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Guinee: Great, thank you. Nice quarter. When I look at your, what I would call a true fab number after subtracting that revenue creating CapEx, it looks like you're going to be in the $4.25 to $4.50 number in 2019. And I think you just increased your dividend about 4% after $3.84. How do you feel over time about being able to sustain a 4% plus dividend increase annually?
Eric Bolton: This is Eric. We feel pretty good about that honestly. We think that we're going to be in a position. I mean, we look at various points-in the cycle obviously. But, we think we're trending back to a normal sort of same-store internal earnings growth rate that's going to be in the kind of 3% range or thereabout on a year-over-year basis. And as we outlined we do believe that the external growth front is going to get better at some point from an acquisitions perspective over the next couple of years. We are increasing our ability to deploy capital and some pretty accretive yields on new development, and so we think that over the next couple of years the external growth picture gets a little stronger. And so it's going to add another 1% or 2% to that, and then you could leverage on that. You start to get to a – and of course, as we continue the recycling effort we'll be selling off older assets and redeploying into newer assets which is going to be beneficial, from us more beneficial from a fab perspective with lower CapEx on a newer asset. So I would tell you we feel pretty uncomfortable about a long-term sustainable growth rate of that dividend in the 4% to 5% range.
John Guinee: Great, thank you very much.
Eric Bolton: You Bet.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go ahead and move onto Omotayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Omotayo Okusanya: Hi, yes, good morning everyone. A question around the redevelopment of the apartment. The cost per unit was a little bit elevated this quarter. Just curious whether that's mix or whether that's the case of construction cost are going up in general? And if that's the case if it has any impact on the return on the yield...
Thomas Grimes: It's mixed Tayo. As we feather in more of the Post portfolio that's $8,000 per unit average roughly and that's pulled by average up over time.
Albert Campbell: And the good news on that Tayo as the rent increases, the economic returns are similar, this is just relative to the large capital you get higher results, higher rent increase.
Thomas L. Grimes: We don't compromise. We don't compromise on returns.
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay that's helpful. And the second thing I want to kind of explore is 2019 guidance the blended rate again 2.2% to 3.2%, so an average about 2.7% or so. I'm just talking about renewals of 5.5% to 6.5% so that means new rates will be kind of a 0-ish basically for the year. And I'm just curious you made the comment earlier on that given the backdrop for your portfolio you're more likely push price even at the risk of losing some occupancy, but when – I kind of think about renewals at 6% and new leases at about zero and the risk that you may have, a couple of developers getting aggressive with pricing and your ability – it sounds like, this full year is going to boil down to the ability of kind of get 6% on renewals? Its like exactly the story this year, and that new leases is going to be – it is what it is?
Albert Campbell: I'll start with that and Tom can add some color on that Tayo. I think, how we thought about the forecast was, we are very happy with January performance, but as we look for the full year we expect renewals to continue to trend. So we saw the logic from last year, we would kind of assuming 5.5% – 5% to 6% range, 5.5% to 6% most likely for the year and so new lease pricing is going to be the most competitive part. It has been and as we – as the supply pressure continues in the market at high levels that will be the point of most competition. So you're right – doing the Math that is flat to slightly positive, I think is what that general expectation would be. Different market to market some markets will be negative, but under more pressure and some are more positive. So you want to give color on some of that, Tom?
Thomas Grimes: Yes, and we touched on it earlier. New lease rate – new lease rates will be under pressure in town Atlanta, Charlotte. Later, Dallas and Austin, but that will vary from place to place. We also see I think strong new lease growth from Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, Phoenix. So its hard to generalize.
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will go ahead and take our next question from Hardik Goel from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Hardik Goel: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering on the land parcels you guys acquired in Houston and Denver how you came up on that opportunity? How long have you been looking at that? And how you're underwriting development today on those? And just a sense for what the yield might be on those?
Eric Bolton: Well, we have been looking at both of these opportunities for quite some time probably anywhere from six months to nine months in advance of actually getting to a point where we're able to put them under contract. The opportunity in Denver is in the areas just a little bit northwest of downtown sort of half between Denver, Downtown Denver and Boulder an area called Westminster that we are well into predevelopment on. We expect to start later in the year and the kind of the August time frame, but this is something that based on our initial – we're still finalizing numbers and so forth, but we would expect to stabilize yield out of this investment somewhere in the 6.5% range on the Denver opportunity. The Houston opportunity is just kind of west of downtown sort of halfway between the Galleria area and the energy corridor area just off of I10. Again it's something – it's an area going through some sort of regentrification. We are pretty excited about the opportunity and again there, we're looking at start, sometime late this year probably in the November time frame. And our early analysis on stabilized yield puts that about 6.4%. So both very creative opportunities based on the underwriting we're looking at right now. As we approach these opportunities, I mean we talked with – we've got a group of developer – group of contractors that we've done a lot of business with and get preliminary pricing for them, but we worked with them enough to have a lot of confidence that the numbers we get from them are something we feel pretty good about. And then we assume some escalation factor in that based on what we do in predevelopment before the time we actually lock down the contracts and go to fixed-price contracts. So more to come on all of this but we feel pretty good about the opportunities at this point.
Hardik Goel: And does that – just as a follow-up is that the same sort of hurdle you would describe to the emerging build acquisitions you're planning on making? Is that 6.5%? Or is it a little lower than that?
Eric Bolton: Yes, it's probably a little bit lower than that. It depends on the situation. If we've got an opportunity that we're working with, right now in Phoenix, with Crescent on essentially a prepurchase or something that they are going to build they will be the developer they will take the majority of that risk. And so we're comfortable taking that down at a slightly lower yield. It's still be low about 6%, but I think that it depends on situation. It depends on just the risk that we underwrite, but all these – opportunities we're looking right now are going to be well north of 6%.
Hardik Goel: Got it. Thank you. That's all from me.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we can go ahead and take our next question from Jim Sullivan from BTIG.
James Sullivan: Thank you. Guys, I just want to drill down a little bit more of the discussion about expenses for 2019. I think back in NAREIT you were talking about a $7 million number I think of kind of credits and one-off items that benefited the 2018 numbers. And if we adjust through that in the 2018 totals that your report for both management – property management and G&A we're still getting an increase in 2019 of about 9% in the overhead line item. And I think there were some comment that there was kind of annualizing some higher expenses that were put in place in 2018 that accounts for that. And – but when I look at the individual items property management, for example that's gone up. It went up more than 4% – went up about 10% in 2018. It's going up about 14% in 2019, and yet this is occurring at a time when same-store revenue growth is not going up that much for all the reasons we have discussed. What accounts for that dichotomy? When I say dichotomy your operating expenses that you can control that is other than real estate taxes are going up as you've indicated below 3% but management expenses are going up nearly 3 times that. What explains that difference in yearly change?
Albert Campbell: Hey, Jim. This is Al. I think as we about talked a lot it has to do with comparisons to 2018 that you outlined. We certainly – we actually had a reduction in cost in 2018, but in 2019 we will feel the full run rate of the investments we made in our platform that we talked about are long, and very important to produce the results that we expect from the future in the people, systems, facilities, web presence all those things that we talked about and so when you look at 2019 to 2018 it does look high. But if you look at 2018 to 2019 and what we expect in '20 and you're going forward and looking at a little bit longer period it will land to more of a 5% to 6% growth rate over time, and I'm talking about both of those together. We think of it as overhead which is the G&A plus the property management together. We sort of manage it as overhead as a bucket. And so I think over a three-year window we feel that sector average 5% to 6% growth is what we're doing we'll do there, and so – 2020 will be a little more modest because obviously we made meaningful investments and we'll be able to grow more efficiently in the nearby areas. That's how we thought about the next year.
James Sullivan: You do describe the two of those items together as a bucket adding summing it up to overhead, but in 2018 the property management expense rose 10% and G&A was down significantly. Presumably, most of the credits that you have talked about the onetime items benefited the G&A line as opposed to the property management line in 2018. Is that true?
Albert Campbell: No, they're all over the place because a lot of the people could be either one. I mean, so you're talk about people and systems cost typically in the property management so it can be, the things that outline could be easily on either side of that. And so I think that's one of the reasons we really try to look at it together and just as more simple say, look we have overhead structure, this total and we're managing it that way. And so – I think it's little easier to think about it holistically.
James Sullivan: Okay, then a final question for me kind of a macro. You've kind of made two comments today about growth rates. You've talked about kind of a longer-term kind of normalized same-store NOI growth rate in terms of expectation of something like 3% annually. And yet when you've talked about the overhead expense line you've talked about, I think it's been described two ways a long-term growth rate of 5%, is I think, as you've indicated in some of your presentations before. And I think today on the call it was somebody mentioned 5% to 6%, and I guess that dichotomy seems inconsistent with a scalable platform. One would have assumed with the Post merger that you were building a scalable platform and part of that conclusion would be that they be the overhead cost would not be increasing at the same rate as the overall revenues. Is that wrong? Am I thinking about that incorrectly?
Albert Campbell: Well, I think what you have to think about is same-store – is that same-store. It's not assuming growth. It's the same portfolio in this year compared to the production part of the previous year. I think the important thing to think about an overhead in G&A as you talk about growing companies. For us and the sector, where does the acquisition development or even many ways and so, your G&A over time is going to grow more than your same-store for growing companies. And I think if you look at the sector average over time, that's what we're talking about a NAREIT over the last couple of years and what we mentioned earlier was if you look at the sector average over time for that area it's more like 5% to 6% growth.
Eric Bolton: I think the only things you have to look at Jim is you have to factor in external growth component as well. Because this platform, the overhead platform if you will is supporting not only same-store but supporting external growth as well. And I think to the extent that we can capture organic internal growth and new external growth on a combined basis at a growth rate that is beyond the 5%, then I think, the margin component there that you're sort of alluding to, I think starts to make more sense. The other thing to keep in mind is that you're talking about 3% growth organic growth of a big number. You're talking about 5% growth on overhead on a smaller aggregate dollar numbers, so the dollar margin is still growing.
Thomas Grimes: The only comment I would make on that latter point is that as you probably know many of your peers report NOI and same-store NOI after property management expenses rather than before. And if we were in your case to look at the same-store NOI computation you have in the sub and compute it that way the growth in same-store NOI would be lower. It would be closer to about a 1.4% number. So we understand the same-store is total NOI. NOI, non-same-store NOI tends to be about 7% or so of total NOI so it's a much smaller number. We do understand there's extra cost involved in that effort of course, but still we tend to look at property management expenses as driven by revenue line. And G&A line – I don't know – I would content based on our analysis that over time. The G&A line has not grown as much as the overall revenue line for the company, for most of the companies we cover. So just a thought as you think about the scalability of the platform, and I guess, I can leave it at that.
James Sullivan: I understand your point. I understand your point.
Operator: And we will go ahead and take our next question from Daniel Bernstein from Capital One.
Daniel Bernstein: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to touch a little bit on the comment on the developers become a little bit more aggressive on leasing. Is that just the assumption you're making? Or you're actually seeing some of that more aggressive leasing with the discounting given three months, so I just wanted to understand where that comments coming from a little bit?
Eric Bolton: It's really more of an assumption at this point Daniel. Tom, can give you some perspective on what we're seeing and more specifically with the lease concessions. But it hasn't really changed a whole lot over the last sort of 60, 90 days, but we just think that as you get later in the cycle and particularly some of these projects continue to face later deliveries and we get into the busy summer season we just think that it's entirely possible that you may see a little – it'll vary by some market but you may see a little bit more aggressive prices. But we have not seen any real evidence of that as of yet.
Daniel Bernstein: Actually one here. Just – that refers to the apartment developers, have you seen increased concession or competition from single-family residence rentals?
Eric Bolton: No. I mean, I say no we're not tracking them. Move-outs to single-family rentals is such a small percentage. And while there is a company that has reasonable scale they're scattered out and really don't affect our markets. I could not speak to what their pricing is.
Albert Campbell: Our move-outs to single-family rental is only about 6% or 7% of our total move-out. It's been that way forever. It hasn't really changed. So it's not really a pressure point for us.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay, good. That's all I had. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our next question from John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisor.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Eric could you provide some thoughts on how your external growth strategy and your smaller secondary markets might look in a world where liquidity from Fannie and Freddie are declined meaningfully and those are away understanding now we know what's going to happen and we've been waiting for 10 years for something to happen, but would you expect to see more dislocation in pricing in your smaller Southeast metros? And would you act on that?
Eric Bolton: The answer is yes and yes. I would think that if Fannie financing work to – for whatever reason pull back, I think you're going to see it to have more of an impact on transaction activity in some of the smaller market. So it'll certainly have an impact in places like Dallas and Atlanta as well. But I'm thinking of markets like Greenville and Richmond and Nashville and Savannah and Charleston and I think you could see more of an impact in those markets. And yes, we absolutely continued to feel very strongly about the merits and the value of having capital deployed in some of these higher-growth more secondary markets believing that the long-term performance profile from an earnings perspective over time out of those markets fits very much with our portfolio strategy and we would certainly jump on opportunities that might come about as a consequence of what you described.
John Pawlowski: Makes sense. I guess, sense for sensitivity again purely hypothetical do you think in your average smaller secondary markets values fall by 5% more than the Atlanta of the world or 10% more? How big do you think it could be if Fannie and Freddie went away overnight.
Eric Bolton: I think to some degree it really depends on just how aggressive institutional capital continues to stay and direct their resources toward multifamily housing. I think that while Dallas or Atlanta may not feel it as much as a secondary market. As you know there's just a ton of capital out there that continues to want to deploy in multifamily. And despite, if the agencies pulled back for some reason well on the margin it will have an impact on some of these smaller buyers I think we are more well-capitalized, private capital balance sheets would probably not be as impacted. And so some of these more dynamic secondary markets may still find a fair amount of interest and so – it's hard to say to what degree a Charleston, South Carolina is impacted versus a Dallas. I don't really know. It just depends on how much interest private capital still has on a Charleston large well-capitalized balance sheet, private balance sheet to have in Charleston.
John Pawlowski: Understood. Last one for me. What job growth assumptions underpin your 2019 revenue growth outlook?
Eric Bolton: Yes. I would tell you basically it's not on an assumption that things continue pretty much like they are right now. I think that our forecast can withstand a little moderation in job growth, but not a lot candidly. And I think that if we saw the employment market and job growth trends severely pull back I think it's a different ballgame. But, we had as you know and I know you pointed out in a lot of your research that the job growth rates are going to likely moderate at some point, and I think that there's no indication near term that we're headed to that sort of scenario. So our 2019 assumptions are built on a continuation of what we see, but frankly at some level I can't look forward to it happening and while it's going to be depending on where we are in the supply cycle it could be painful two or three quarters as we work through that. But certainly we think that some of these lease-up projects and some of the supply coming online, will face some pretty severe pressure which is going to create new things and great opportunities to capture some value on an acquisition side. And we've got a balance sheet ready to jump on that shouldn't happen, but anyway – we think 2019 looks a lot like 2018 on that regard.
John Pawlowski: All right, great. Thanks.
Operator: And we will go ahead to take our final question from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Please go ahead your line is open.
Buck Horne: No, thanks guys. My questions have all been answered. So I will end the call there. Thank you.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Buck.
Eric Bolton: Well, operator I think that's all the questions. And so we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. With that, we'll just terminate the call. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at anytime.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-11-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MAA Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder this conference is being recorded today, November 1, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. Please go ahead.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim. Good morning. The demand for apartment housing across our footprint remained strong and shows no signs of moderating. High demand and low resident turnover have supported our ability to capture strong occupancy and positive rent growth despite the high levels of new supply in several of our markets. On a blended lease-over-lease basis as compared to the prior in place leases, rents grew by 3.1% in the third quarter. This is 60 basis points better than the same time last year. While we've not yet wrapped up our budgeting efforts for next year, we do expect that strong demand will offer the opportunity for continued positive momentum in rent growth during 2019, despite the new supply headwinds. As part of our fall budgeting process, we performed a robust and detailed assessment of the new supply outlook across our portfolio. Supplementing the information from third-party research, we do a property-by-property and immediate submarket review to consider specifically how new supply is likely to pressure leasing across our portfolio in the coming year. Tom will share more in his comments, but our early assessment is that the 2019 new supply pressures at a portfolio level will likely moderate slightly from the volume of new deliveries in 2018 and support continued improved -- improvement in new lease rent growth in 2019. We continue to capture good results from the various expense synergies and new initiatives coming out of our merger with Post Properties, primarily in the area of repair and maintenance costs. As we approach the two year mark since our merger, we do expect that we'll begin to see some of the initial lift from expense synergies start to moderate on a year-over-year basis, as we move into 2019. During the quarter, we did see some pressure from real estate taxes and hurricane cleanup. Al will speak to this in his comments, but with cap rates compressing further over the past year, as our annual tax build started coming in over the last couple of months. The corresponding impact on real estate taxes has been evident. As noted in our updated guidance for the year, we pulled down our expectation for property acquisitions and do not expect to close on anything between now and year-end. Significant pools of profit capital continue to aggressively bid our pricing. As it has been for years, our capital deployment protocols are built around the goal to be earnings accretive in fairly short order. Today's pricing for stabilized properties or even though still in initially lease-up are rarely meeting our earnings accretion goal at this point. On the development front, we're continuing to find opportunities that we believe will offer attractive and accretive NOI yields. As noted in our earnings release, during the third quarter, we started construction on a Phase II expansion in our Sync36 property in Denver bringing our current development pipeline to $148 million. We currently have additional sites either owned or under contract in Denver, Houston, Fort Worth and Orlando they are currently in pre-development. We hope to get started with these projects at some point during the coming year. In addition to this development pipeline, we have another five properties representing over 1,600 units currently under initial leased up in all performing in line with our expectations. In addition to our new development and lease-up pipelines, we continue to capture strong returns on our redevelopment pipeline with over 6,500 units redeveloped so far this year generating very attractive returns on capital. We have another roughly 20,000 units that we expect to redevelop over the coming two to three years. In summary the revenue momentum that we expected from improving pricing trends this year and the work completed toward stabilizing our operating platform are all coming together as expected. It's been a busy and transformative two years for MAA as our team worked to integrate the former Post portfolio operations and associates. We've retooled or replaced essentially every system in much of the technology platform of the company. As you might imagine, this has created a lot of demands in our team, while also fighting the headwind on higher levels of new supply. I'm happy to report that the systems and associated policy and procedural transformation work, along with all staffing changes and integration activities are now complete. The MAA operating platform and the balance sheet are stronger than ever. I'm proud of the work and results accomplished by our folks. I'm very excited to now move forward with more opportunity to grow higher volume from our existing portfolio of properties. Our lease-up, development and redevelopment pipelines are all poised to drive higher value over the next couple of years. We look forward to finishing 2018 on a strong note and continuing the momentum over the coming year. And that's all I have, I'll turn it over to Tom now.
Thomas Grimes: Thank you, Eric. And good morning, everyone. Our operating performance for the third quarter came in as expected with building momentum in rent growth, continued strong occupancy and improving trends that support our outlook for the year. The integration work on the operating platform was evident in our leasing momentum during the quarter. We saw blended lease-over-lease performance of the combined portfolio grow 3.1% in the third quarter and just 60 basis points higher than the same time last year. This brought our year-to-date blended rent increase up to 2.8%, which positions us to be well within the 2.25% to 2.75% blended rent increase range for the year that we established to meet our revenue guidance range. This steady positive trend in blended pricing drove our sequential average effective rent per unit up 130 basis points from Q2 to Q3. This is the highest sequential increase we've seen since the Post merger. As a result, revenues also increased 130 basis points from the second quarter to the third quarter. While elevated supply levels have pressured rent growth in several of our markets, particularly Dallas and Austin, we're still seeing good revenue growth in a number of our markets. Phoenix, Orlando, Richmond and Jacksonville were our strongest revenue growth markets. Expense performance has been steady in both portfolios. In addition to the real estate, tax pressure and storm cost, personnel and marketing were affected by 4% increase in move-ins during the quarter. Despite these pressures, overall expenses within the same-store portfolio were up just 2.3% for the quarter. The favorable trends continued into October. All key indicators are trending ahead of last year. Overall same-store October blended lease-over-lease rates were up 2.3%, which is 90 basis points better than October of last year. Average daily occupancy for the month was a strong 96.1%, which is 20 basis points better than October last year. Our 60 day exposure, which represents all vacant units and move-out of notices for a 60 day period is just 6.1%, which is 50 basis points lower than last year. We are in good shape as we head into the slower winter leasing season. Our focus on customer service and retention coupled with strong renter demand continued to drive down resident turnover. Move-outs by our current residents remains low. Move-outs to over -- move-outs for the overall same-store portfolio were down 30 basis points for the quarter. Move-outs to home buying and move-outs to home renting were essentially flat representing less than 20% and 7% of our turnover respectively. On a rolling 12 month basis, turnover remained at our historic low of 49.2%. The steady low level of turnover was achieved while increasing renewal rents by a strong 6%. Momentum is building on the redevelopment program across the legacy Post portfolio. Through the third quarter, we've completed 2,300 units and expect to complete the 3,000 this year on the Post portfolio. On average we're spending $8,900 per unit and getting a rent increase that is 11% more than a comparable non-redeveloped unit. As a reminder, we've identified a total of 13,000 Post units that have compelling redevelopment opportunity. For the total portfolio, we've completed 6,500 units and we expect to complete over 8,000 interior upgrades for the year. On the legacy MAA portfolio, we continue to have a robust redevelopment pipeline of 9,000 to 12,000 units. On a combined basis with the legacy Post portfolio, our total redevelopment pipeline now stands in the neighborhood of 19,000 to 22,000 units. Our active lease-up communities are performing well and in line with our expectations. Post South Lamar and Acklen West End stabilized unscheduled during the third quarter. Our remaining current pipeline of five lease-up properties are on track to stabilize on schedule. As part of our budgeting process for 2019, we're taking a deeper look at the supply affecting our markets. We take third-party data and then crosscheck the supply with our own asset-by-asset information. Performance by market will vary, but at this point, we believe overall our markets will improve modestly with some decline in deliveries. Our Dallas and Austin assets are expected to remain challenging with supply levels in the 3% to 4% of inventory range. We expect Charlotte to soften as supply picks up near our assets. We expect the strength in Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa and Phoenix to continue as all currently shown supply decreasing. While we've not completed our budgeting process assuming the demand side of the equation remains strong, at this point, we expect to see the positive momentum in rents realized in 2018 to continue into 2019. We are pleased to have the merger integration wrapped up and we are encouraged with the building momentum in our revenues. I'm proud of the effort and hard work our team has put in over the last two years. We are glad to have this work behind us and look forward to finishing well in 2018 and moving on to 2019. Al?
Albert Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Tom. And good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally on guidance for the remainder of 2018. As Eric mentioned, overall performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. FFO growth of $1.50 per share was in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Total revenue growth for the same-store portfolio of 2% for the quarter, was primarily produced by 2.1% increase in average effective rents, which continued to accelerate from the 1.7% increase in the second quarter. Our year-to-date revenue growth of 1.8% is in line with our full year guidance and strong occupancy levels and blended lease-over-lease pricing performance for the quarter support our expectation of continued acceleration for both average effective rent growth and total revenue for the fourth quarter. As Tom mentioned same-store operating expenses during the quarter were slightly impacted by cleanup costs from Hurricane Florence and increased pressure on real estate taxes. These pressures are expected to continue into the fourth quarter, which I'll discuss a bit more in just a moment. However, despite these pressures overall, operating expense growth of just 2.3% still remains below our long-term average growth rate. FFO results for the third quarter were also slightly impacted by the mark-to-market valuation by preferred shares, which produced $400,000 of non-cash expense for the third quarter. No evaluation has been volatile over the last few quarters, as we expected the third quarter adjustment brings full year impact to $300,000 of non-cash expense which is premier or estimate of no debt impact for the full year. We completed one development community during the quarter Post Centennial Park, a high-end community located in Atlanta. We also began the construction of an expansion phase of the community acquired last quarter Sync36, which is located in Denver. Phase I of this community contains 374 units, which remained on lease-up. In the second phase, we add another 79 units, which were expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of next year. We now have four communities in active development, representing a total projected cost of $148 million. We funded total construction cost of about $13 million during the third quarter and expect to fund the remaining $102 million over the next 18 months to 24 months to complete pipeline. We expect to stabilize NOI yield of 6.3% -- this portfolio once completed and fully leased up. As Tom mentioned, our lease-up portfolio continues to perform well. During the third quarter, two communities reached all stabilization, which we track is 90% occupancy per 90 days. At the end of the quarter, we had five communities remaining in lease-up, including the recently completed development community, with an average occupancy of 66.9% for the group at quarter-end. We expect a growing contribution to our 2019 earning strength from our lease-up portfolio as two of these communities are fully stabilized during the fourth quarter this year with remaining three stabilized during 2018. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. During the third quarter, we paid off $300 million of current year debt maturities using capacity under our unsecured line of credit. We have an additional $80 million of debt maturities during the fourth quarter. And as previously discussed, we do anticipate pursuing additional financing over the next couple of quarters to refinance remaining current year and first half of 2019 debt maturities. At the end of the quarter, we had over $674 million of combined cash and remaining capacity under our unsecured line of credit. Our leverage as defined by our bond covenants was only 32.5%. Our net debt-to-recurring EBITDAre is just below 5 times at quarter-end. As noted in the earnings release, we have recorded what we believe are appropriate reserves for defend cost in our Texas late fee class action lawsuits disclosed in our recent 8-K. We believe that our late fee policy and practices are in line with those and other Texas landlords and comply with Texas law. In addition, we have adjusted our loss reserves in our third quarter financial statements, as a result of significant progress made toward the settlement of two legacy Post property's lawsuits DOJ case and ERC case, which was closed in previous filings as well. Just to note, we don't plan to provide additional commentary for specific details on the pending lawsuits during the Q&A portion of our call. Given third quarter performance and updated expectations for the remainder of the year, we are updating certain guidance assumptions. First, we're entering our full year guidance range for both same-store combined lease-over-lease pricing growth, which is 2.25% and 3.25% for the year and same-store total property revenue growth, which is 1.25% and 2.25% for the full year. We now expect fourth quarter expense performance to be effective by unforcasted cleanup expenses right to Hurricane Michael, as well as increase state tax expense especially to specific exposure in Atlanta and Dallas. As final tax information was obtained for the year very aggressive value increases in Atlanta, mileage rates increases in Dallas are expected to impact our portfolio. We will continue to aggressively fight these increases while revising our guidance. Real estate tax expenses for the full year is in expected range of 4% to 5%, 50 basis points increase at the midpoint. The combination of these items produced a revision to our guidance for total same-store property operating expenses to an expected range of 2% to 2.5% for the full year. And to our same-store NOI guidance for the full year to a range of 1.75% to 2.25% both representing a 25 basis points change to previous guidance at the midpoint. Other notable changes to our guidance included reduction in our estimated range of multi-family property acquisitions for the year, as well as projected full year total overhead costs, which we count SG&A plus property management expense. Given the competitive environment approximately at year-end we don't expect to close any additional acquisition this year. Since our projections included primary lease-up deals heavily weighted in the latter part of the year. This change has little effect on our 2018 earnings. Favorable impact from several items including franchise taxes, insurance costs, legal cost, timing of final staffing changes related to the recent migration project in other items produced expected overhead favorable to the full year. Some of this has been impact as essentially timing related and we expect 2019 overhead cost to include less unusual and non-recurring activity, as well as more normalized staffing merger integration efforts are fully complete. In summary, net income per diluted common share is now projected to be $1.87 to $1.99 per share for the full year. FFO is projected to be $5.99 to $6.11 per share or $6.05 per share at the midpoint. AFFO for the full year is now projected to be $5.38 to $5.50 per share or $5.44 at the midpoint. So that's all we have on the way of prepared comments. We'll now turn the call back to you for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Trent Trujillo: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First from a guidance perspective most of the annual leasing is complete and you likely have pretty good visibility as you alluded to -- in your prepared comments on what's left for the year. So I'm curious why you still have the relatively wide range of outcomes for FFO in the fourth quarter, so maybe if you can frame the variability given where we are at this point in the year?
Albert Campbell: This is Al. I can comment on that. We narrowed it down obviously to that what was in the third quarter, but just given outcomes it would be a big change in occupancy, a change in transactions. We had something significant that causes to be bottom end or the high end of the range, particularly, but we feel pretty good about the range. I think one thing I'll add Trent is the preferred shares and that has been fairly volatile over the quarter, so that can swing quite a bit as well, which is out of our control obviously.
Trent Trujillo: Okay. Thank you. And I appreciate the prepared comments on supply, but on your last earnings call, you mentioned deliveries in your markets were expected to drop about 18% in 2019. So what has changed since then because, is it just a function of supply being pushed out because it' seems like it's pretty material change to the outlook versus just a few months ago.
Eric Bolton: Well, I think a couple of things have transpired. One is yes, I do think there is some delays in delivery that are at play here. But candidly, we saw some pretty radical change over the course of the year in the third-party research data that we get regarding supply outlook. And we go through as Al mentioned -- I'm sorry, Tom mentioned, we've gone through a pretty detailed annual process with our properties, as part of our budgeting process, but and we're well into that at this point. But frankly over the course of the summer, we saw a lot of the information that we sort of monitor and work with during the year from some of these third-party data sources really begin to change on us quite a bit. And then as we began to dig in more to both their information, as well as dig into or start our -- add more detailed budgeting process. We began to see that while still down supply overall is still going to be down from everything that we are seeing. We do think that the extent of the drop in new supply deliveries is perhaps not as great as we would have thought a few months back.
Trent Trujillo: Alright. Appreciate the color. I'll hop back in queue. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi. Good morning, guys. I was just curious how much moderation are you assuming in blended lease rate pricing through the balance of the year?
Albert Campbell: Austin, this is Al. We've assumed as we talked about all year that we would see blended pricing accelerate to produce our revenue performance in the year. We always had revenue performance accelerating as we saw, we did in Q3. I think overall revenue went from 1.5% to 1.8%. So I think we saw what we expected in terms of momentum. We saw a good momentum through the quarter and Tom talked about in his comments in October. So I think what we always expected was to have pricing performance that was above last year's performance about 60 basis points. And we suddenly saw that in third quarter. We've seen that so far in fourth quarter. So that's what it gives a lot of confidence about our range where we end up for the year.
Eric Bolton: Well, I'll also say it's important to recognize that as Al mentioned our forecast for the year was built on an assumption that blended lease-over-lease pricing is going to be in the range of 2.25% to 2.75% for the full year. Okay. Through September year-to-date, we're at 2.8% above the top end of the range. So clearly, there is some moderation that we anticipate over the next quarter.
Albert Campbell: Which be projected and put in our guidance I think important terms or guidance the performance over the prior year, which we're seeing and we feel very good about.
Austin Wurschmidt: Right. And then, that's kind of what I was kind of driving at. You're tracking ahead of that range. You've got a 90 basis point spread in October. Do you expect to sustain that level of a spread or could it even widen potentially through the balance of the year?
Eric Bolton: I believe it can widen Austin. We will see. We don't want to guarantee that. But we're running 90% now and we have favorable comparisons in November and December.
Albert Campbell: You may recall that candidly in November, December last year, we saw particularly in our Dallas portfolio and particularly in the uptown submarket, we saw some fairly significant concession activity pop up, a bit unexpected late last year in November, December which really put a big hit on effective pricing over the last two months of that quarter. And we certainly don't see any indication that, that is likely to repeat this year. So I think we just sum it up by saying, we think that the trends that we're seeing right now give us a pretty high level of confidence going into the final quarter of the year.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just one more for me. With a decrease in the acquisition guidance and some of the challenges you've had sourcing new deals, are you rethinking capital allocation at all between acquisitions and development?
Eric Bolton: Well, one thing I'll say is I mean, we're sourcing a lot of deals I mean, we're underwriting more than we've ever -- in the third quarter, we ended up more than we've underwritten in any quarter over the last five years, so I mean just a ton of deals out there. But as I mentioned the pricing is just really gotten to a point that we're having a hard time justifying pulling the trigger on these deals that we're looking at. And so yes, having said that, we are continuing to look for opportunities on the development front. As mentioned, we started some things in the third quarter. And as I alluded to, we've got a number of projects that we are working currently either on existing own land or land sites that we have on the contract two in Denver, one in Fort Worth, one in Houston, one in Orlando and another one in Raleigh that we might -- it's probably another 1.5 years before we pull the trigger on that one. But yes, we've -- I mean one of the things that we were looking forward to as coming out of the merger with Post is to sort of broaden our arsenal in terms of our ability to both recycle capital, as well as support external growth and the development capabilities that came with that merger or something that we thought made sense for us, at the point of cycle we're in. So yes, you'll see the development. Right now, we're $148 million development pipeline. I certainly expect that's going to grow over the coming year. But also we're going to be -- we're not going to go crazy with it. I think that, if you look at our enterprise value right now $0.5 billion pipeline is going to be right about 3% of our enterprise value. So I wouldn't be surprised to see a scale up to $400 million or $500 million over the next year. I doubt, it must be bigger than that, but that certainly becomes more attractive to us at this point in the cycle.
Austin Wurschmidt: So just one quick follow-up if I may. Just curious how your thinking about the risks from construction today where we've seen cost overruns and certainly some delays in deliveries. How are you incorporating that I guess into your forecast for development yields?
Eric Bolton: Well, as thoughtfully as we can, I'll tell you that. Yes, you're right. We've had a pullback on some projects that we were looking at or we put some on mothballs if you will for a while, while we work through some cost issues. All the deals that we do are guaranteed cost construction contracts, so we don't build it ourselves. And so we take a lot of effort to sort of lock in our cost before we actually commit and pull the trigger on it. And then we take a thoughtful approach to lease-up assumptions and we generally are pretty good about nailing that outlook. And we've consistently been able to sort of achieve our lease-up velocity. But yes, this is the time to be careful for sure and we're taking a pretty careful approach in terms of how we lock in our cost before we commit to actually starting to move down on any opportunity that we look at in today's environment with rising cost. I surely think that's the right approach.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Eric, you just mentioned the strong pricing in the market. And I know, you're focused on earnings growth, but given the current dynamic would you opportunistically sell into this strong pressure?
Eric Bolton: Nick, we've recycled quite a bit of capital over the last five years, something approaching $3 billion. We've obviously paid with that -- with a lot of earnings that we conceded as a consequence of that recycling. And of course, the most recent merger with Post was a fairly initially dilutive deal for us. So I will tell you this, we very much liked the footprint that we have. We're very much like sort of the market mix that we have. We don't see any real need to radically alter the profile of the portfolio. I do think that as we go into next year, this is the first year -- calendar year 2018 is the first year. We haven't sold anything in as long as I can remember prior to 15 years and so. I think that you'll us probably get back to recycling a little capital next year and it won't be a lot, but I do want to get back to that practice. And we will likely do some next year and some of this development opportunity starts to pick up obviously, the redeployment of that capital becomes easier to accomplish. So I think you'll see us do a little bit more next year.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just the same-store expenses, do you assume any baseline expense impact on potential hurricanes in initial guidance, and what would you do is no removal cost or anything like that?
Albert Campbell: You're talking about the fourth quarter Nick or for as we look into next year?
Nick Joseph: Going into the year, so on initial guidance do you assume that there'll be some costs associated with the hurricane?
Albert Campbell: Hurricanes, no, we do not. It's not something -- no we don't Nick. That's just something we think at the beginning of the year that we really can anticipate many years we don't have certainly any significant cost and so we're unfortunate last year and this year, but something we do not forecast currently.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rob Stephenson with Janney. Please go ahead.
Robert Stevenson: Thanks. Good morning, guys. You guys did a chunk of rehabs during the quarter roughly 6,000 per unit versus your year-to-date cost of roughly a little over 5,700. So if I back those out I mean you have a pretty substantial jump from what you paid in the third quarter versus what you were through the first six months of the year. Was that just a mix in doing more heavy stuff or is that indicative of the cost pressures that you're seeing from a labor especially, but also from a material standpoint as you do rehab these days?
Eric Bolton: Fair question, Rob and you've almost answered it. We are not seeing cost escalation issues in the rehab arena. The vendors and the materials that we use its not heavy lumber. It's not concrete. It's not glass. We're not rebuilding them. And the vendors are different set of vendors than are on our construction jobs. They're local guys, that specialize in redevelopment. So what you are talking about is dead-on correct.We saw -- we did more units that had full granite counter tops and cabinets just as -- it shifted actually from like 22% to about 30% and our mix just go around. If you look at, and this is really driven by the Post side of things. If you look at on just an apples-to-apples basis, our cost per renovate especially on the Post side has dropped about $200 a unit just as we've sort of gotten in a groove on it and are improving in that area.
Thomas Grimes: But mostly the increases because more of the Post portfolios coming into the mix and …
Eric Bolton: It's two things and it is two things.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then on the development pipeline, what's the current expected stabilized yield on the for projects that you guys have under construction currently? And how do you guys think about starting new projects? Is it -- some of your peers talk about it is a spread over comparable acquisitions? Is it absolute that we are not going to do anything that doesn't get us to a mid to high 5s at least stabilized yield I mean, how does that sort of work internally at MAA these days?
Eric Bolton: Well, I can tell you the yield first on that Rob, it's about 6.3% on the portfolio, which has we think is about 150 basis points over an acquisition of a similar quality product in today's marketplace.
Albert Campbell: And Rob I would tell you that as I commented on in my prepared comments we really guided by an NOI yield analysis and assessing the accretive nature or not of that yield. And I will tell you that any development that we do today and would start today, we'd want to be fairly comfortable or actually really comfortable that we're going to be looking at a stabilized yield at six or higher and really keep that spread as I made reference to between sort of the yields that we see today on any acquisition with stabilized asset. But more importantly, we think that kind of yield we're going to be value accretive and earnings accretive to the long term earnings trend of the company. So that's kind of where we underwrite six north of that.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And Al that six-three is that just on the four that are currently under construction, does that include the five during lease-up?
Albert Campbell: Just four under construction right now. The ones in the lease-up, we have some that are acquired some mixture of properties and there, so it will a little bit low, but it's still be get better than higher than a yield on an acquisition portfolio.
Eric Bolton: The other five or six-two, so it's right there with the development.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. Six-three on the four and six-two on the five.
Albert Campbell: Right.
Robert Stevenson: Alright. Thanks guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Drew Babin from Baird. Please go ahead.
Andrew Babin: Quick question for Al on the balance sheet. Obviously, a lot of secured maturities for next year. I think you talked before about potentially taking those out with unsecured offering in the fourth quarter. Is that still possibly in the plans and would there be any thought to extending your overall duration need I think mixing maybe a 30 year in somewhere or anything like that? Would that still makes sense given the flatter yield curve?
Albert Campbell: Yes. Great question, Drew. We absolutely -- in our plans right now, as I talked about, we had about $300 million maturing in Q3. We have another $80 million in Q4 and we have about $500 million maturing in the first half of 2019 that we may well want to get ahead off. So we are thinking about that. And we think we'll be active -- assuming the markets are favorable and open for us over the next several months. We think that we'll potentially pursue some activities. And we would expect to do a pretty sizable financing to replace some of those. And we are looking at potentially pushing on our durations. And I would say right now given the shape of the yield curve their strategy you can take that, that would help you push your duration's out and keep the cost relatively similar to a 10 year deal. So we're definitely looking at that and hopefully we'll have more to say that in the next couple of quarters calls.
Andrew Babin: Okay. Given the spreads that you see today and it looks like the debt maturing next year sort of 5 times to 9 times rate. Should we expect that the swap there would be -- just maybe swaps around, would the deal likely be accretive to earnings?
Albert Campbell: Keep in mind -- I would say keep in mind that majority of our debt has already been fair market -- value at fair market value pretty recently, mostly from the mergers and so, what you're seeing in our interest expense is a rate that's pretty close to current market levels. Now on a cash basis, absolutely, I think on a cash basis, absolutely it will be a benefit to us because two mergers we had a lot of our debt is mark-to-market. We're feeling the rate at similar to current market levels.
Andrew Babin: Okay. That makes sense. And one last question just on the property taxes. I guess in past years there has been some success with appeals on both the assessments and the mileage rates and you've kind of provided in NOI benefit maybe later in the year. And I guess, just how did those negotiations go this year? What was different this year? Are you seeing the municipalities and assessors just being more aggressive?
Albert Campbell: I think, overall we -- put it this way, as we said in the past we fight very hard anything we think is unreasonable. In Texas, we've got 40 that's the pressure Texas and Georgia two pressure points right now. We've got 40 losses going now. I think the unusual thing this year was really two specific areas. You had Atlanta, Fulton County, who really put out a very high valuation increase across the tax register. I'm talking in the 30% range cross register and so everyone believed, we saw that come out maybe in the second quarter. But everyone believed, typically what they do in that situation take mileage rates down significantly to level the part to mostly offset that and just put themselves in a better position going forward for tax valuation. They didn't do that this time. They raised the valuation significantly and brought the mileage rates down just a small amount. So unfortunately that is something you can't fight the mileage rates, so we think there will be some fallout maybe over the next couple of years or maybe even late this year on that as partitions do their thing, but that is what happened in Atlanta. It's pressure for sure. And in Dallas you had a situation where there was an additional mileage rate increase in certain districts, but school districts that was over 8% or 10% increase in some of the districts and it's so high that they have to have -- they have to put it from both in Texas. If it's over 8% share for both. So it's possible long way of saying, we certainly think it's possible that we'll get some favorability in the future maybe 2019 and beyond as some of these things work through. But it's going to take a lot of work to the system and we adjusted our reserves for the remainder of the year to reflect what we think is a reasonable case.
Andrew Babin: Okay. Great, helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Richard Anderson: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So if I could go back to the development discussion Eric and Al you mentioned supply pressure is still around you perhaps slightly less next year. You mentioned having to be careful at this point in the cycle the REIT, but development costs are rising at a faster rate than NOI. I think you would agree with that as well. But yet the development pipeline could rise by 2% or 3% I'm sorry, 2 times or 3 times in the next year or two you said $400 million to $500 million. I'm just curious how is that possible that you can make the numbers work to the degree where you can see it grow that much in this environment? What's the MAA advantage to get six plus type of stabilized yields despite all those things and those pressures happening around you?
Eric Bolton: Well, it's couple of things. One, I mean, in some cases the projects we're looking at are expansions of existing communities, where you leverage off the existing infrastructure and amenities and the existing overhead of the in-place staff in Phase 1. So you can create a little better margin from an operating and from an investment perspective on these expansion opportunities. Two, I think that we are in some cases executing on existing owned land sites as well that we have a lower basis on. And then I think other than that as I think you probably know we've had a history of being able to operate pretty cost efficiently at the property level over the years and then it's only gotten better or stronger if you will given our scale now. And so I think a combination of all those factors offers an opportunity for us to still deploy capital on the development side where we are taking certainly some level of risk more so then you would have in an acquisition, but risk that we feel very comfortable executing with and as I say probably the biggest risk is that, you commit to a project or you started and then all of a sudden your construction cost get away from me and we are not going to take that risk. I mean we go into with the guarantied fixed price contract with the contractor. And we put in a lot of ample cushion in case, we do run into some degree of problem. But all those factors sort of come together to create in our markets at least in the regions that we're in -- the markets we're in an ability to make these deals work at the levels and the numbers that we've been talking about.
Richard Anderson: Okay. Fake Pergo floor as I remember well..
Eric Bolton: Yes.
Richard Anderson: And then if sort of to correlate that question. Eric, do you see an opportunity down the road for broken deals to come back your way and by value add maybe next year or late next year into 2020? Are those types of things starting to sort of percolate behind the scenes or is that just not being seen just yet?
Eric Bolton: Rich, I think that we are starting to see maybe some really early indication that things are starting to fray a little bit. The deal volume -- as I mentioned, the deal volume is really high right now. And we are hearing more about deals not trading that have been under contract previously. The challenge of course is there's still a lot of very strong buyers waiting in the wings and waiting around the hoop just to jump on any of these deals. We used to be able to hang around the hoop with a lot of other people around us and now there are a lot of people around us so. But I do think, as I'm sure, there's just -- I hear just huge numbers of capital -- private capital on the sidelines that are specifically earmarked to deploy in multifamily real estate. So I think that the deals flow and the opportunities I think are starting to pick up, but the buyer pool is still pretty, pretty aggressive. But we are hearing and seeing more deals fall apart a little early indication on that. So I'm optimistic that next year, we may see the tide turned just a little bit.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Good morning. You had a slight increase in your development yield It sounds like this quarter was flat. Is that because rents have been trending better than expected or is that due to mix?
Albert Campbell: I think it's common. It's really more of the mix of properties that we had in there John. I think 6% to 6.5% yield is pretty consistent on the deals that we've seen. I think it's a little bit different mix and then put 6% a couple of quarters ago I think there's a little bit different mix of properties in there.
John Kim: And I think you alluded to this in your prepared remarks and in other answer to the questions but with your balance sheet at $0.05 net debt-to-EBITDA, can you just list your priorities for these capital developments, redevelopments and acquisitions?
Eric Bolton: Well, right now, without a doubt our most accretive use of money is redevelopment. So we're going to push that agenda as aggressively as we can without -- you can't push it too far and you start to really change the economics. But we're going to continue to push that agenda as much as we can. And the good news is, there's a lot of opportunity there. We're just now really getting into the Post portfolio. And that's where we see some of our best yield opportunity on that redevelopment capital. I think after that as I alluded to some of the development deals that we're looking at continue to pencil out pretty accretively. So we're going to be mindful of the risk on that, but continue to pursue that agenda. And then just we're going to remain patient on the acquisition side. We continue to underwrite a lot and look a lot, but we're just now pulling the trigger on anything right now given the pricing we would have to pay and the outlook for sort of rent growth that we think is there over the next few years. The two just come together to create an outlook that to me is not particularly appealing from an earnings accretion perspective. And so we're just going to wait on that and wait for pricing or something to change the dynamic there.
John Kim: Okay. And then on your 2.3% growth on blended leases in October. Can you give the new versus renewal and also the 90 basis point improvements, any difference between legacy Post and legacy MAA?
Thomas Grimes: Yes. Okay. So the improvement on new leases was 110 basis points in October and the renewal was 60 basis points. In both MAA and Post were pretty much in neck and neck on that one. MAA was 1.1% better than last year. And Post was 1% better than last year and a about same on renewals.
John Kim: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Please go ahead.
Daniel Bernstein: Hi. Good morning. Sticking to the development questions seems to be the flavor of the day. Have you thought about doing any -- instead of on balance sheet maybe something that's more funding developers like loan to own, and taking some of that risk off on the development side and maybe -- or maybe with private equity and not taking all the balance sheet risk at this point in the cycle?
Eric Bolton: We have -- and we've had some conversations with a number of people about that, that we're working an opportunity currently in the Phoenix market much along the lines of what you describe. We are -- one of the things that I've always felt that we wanted to be focused on, as we do have these conversations to come in and talk with the developer and providing the funding I think there needs to be a clear pathway for us to ultimately secure ownership with the asset. I think just deploying capital, so lender is not what we really want to do. I think that we ultimately want to control the assets at the end of the day once the property is fully built and leased out. So we're having a number of those kind of conversations. And as I said, we're working on one opportunity right now that may come together.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. Are there any particular markets that you would want to develop in or gain scale in? Some of your markets that are 3%, 4%, 5% of NOI, would that assuming market conditions are right for that -- would that help the investment yield on development to be gain scale in a particular market?
Eric Bolton: Sure, it certainly enhances our operating efficiencies as we grow scale in a given market, so. But yes, I mean that's why we're looking at trying to grow our presence in the Denver market right now. We have -- we mentioned in our call, we've got one expansion project that we initiated in the third quarter in Denver. We've got two other land sites currently, one owned and one under -- well both owned actually at this point that we may very well pull the trigger on next year. So Denver is a market that is high in our target list at the moment. Orlando, we mentioned really any of the Florida markets continued, we find a lot of appeal there. Raleigh, is another market that we've got a site under control. They're in all those markets are in that kind of 3%, 4% range that you're alluding to. Houston, we've got a site that -- on the contract there as well. So yes, the answer to your question is all those markets offer opportunity to pursue this and create a little bit more scale and operating efficiency.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. One more quick question. It seems like marketing expenses went up sequentially and I know that's much smaller bucket in taxes and some of the other ones. But is there anything that we should read into that in terms of going-forward expense growth?
Thomas Grimes: Yes. In the quarter we spent a little bit more on marketing expenses and drove about 20% more leads and a higher level of movements during the quarter. But we'd expect -- it was actually a little behind in Q1 and two and expect it to be back in line in four. So now real REIT through on that just timing more than anything.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. So just normalizing?
Thomas Grimes: Yes. Sure.
Daniel Bernstein: Okay. That's it. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead.
John Guinee: Great. Thank you. About nine months ago, we were in Orlando for the MMHC conference. And if you would listen to the research guys, so I think they're pretty good. Every one of them said B product, secondary markets, lower price point had a greater potential for top-line revenue growth than A product in urban markets. And looking at the REITs year-to-date that doesn't seem to have been the case. Any thoughts on -- is that a correct in my recollection of the research forecast since the beginning of the year and that have maybe hasn't quite played out at that way?
Thomas Grimes: I'd be glad. Our experiences that it has and I would give you the example the Atlanta market. The Inner Loop, High End, Buckhead, Brookwood, Midtown Corridor has been very much under pressure and that's affected our Atlanta numbers. Outside the perimeter of the 85 Corridor or 575 Corridor and 75 those a little bit more suburban and skew toward B assets are performing at a higher rate. And so it's hard to get a pure read through on A versus B by looking at the REITs individually.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Greenstreet. Please go ahead.
John Pawlowski: Thanks. Eric or Tom I know the smaller metro you operated have been a little bit seeing better growth of late. When we step two or three years would you underwrite higher revenue growth in your smaller metros or your bigger metros?
Thomas Grimes: I think, over it depends on where you are in the cycle. And I think in the current environment where these larger markets are seeing more supply, they're going to be under more pressure from a rent to growth perspective then what you're going to see in some of the smaller markets they're not seeing as a percent of the existing stock quite the level of supply. But I think that as you get into another stage of the cycle where perhaps some of the supply pressures have pulled back a little bit recognizing that those larger markets tend to over time have more robust job growth over time, you then get back to the point of the cycle where the larger markets tend to outperform some of the smaller markets. So it really depends on where you are in the supply cycle and broadly in the economic cycle in terms of how the two different sort of types of markets perform. I think that if we continue to see supply remained pretty elevated over the next couple of years, I think the larger markets will probably struggle a little bit more. But the good news of course is our markets are creating some fabulous job growth. And so, while the supply is elevated the demand side of the equation is so strong that it's keeping the performance from really being more problematic than you might think. One of the things that's interesting is just -- what gives me pause more than anything is when do something radically different happen, when do something radically a big change and it's usually a recession or some sort of massive pullback on the demand side of the equation that's always hard to anticipate. If that kind of scenario plays out that's where you really see the smaller markets really start to outperform the large markets because those large markets tend to be much more susceptible to recessionary environment. So it's hard to really say over the next two or three years exactly how those two segments will perform relative to each other depends on these other factors, but I just come to conclude that better to be diversified than not diversified and be ready for whatever may come.
John Pawlowski: Makes sense. And I know supply grabs all the air time on these calls and all the headlines. When you look at the demand backdrop in any of your markets, are you seeing any concerns, any leading indicators of concerns for the demand side of equation in your market?
Thomas Grimes: No. At this point it is steady as it goes. We're not seeing any pullback. But that information is more hypothesis than I think the supply is. We can get a B and are getting a better B on what our supply is. But what the job growth number is going to be for next year is more hypothetical. But more in the momentum feels good right now.
Eric Bolton: Yes. And I would tell you that when you think about the demand side of the equation being a function of not only just the economy and job growth but also the other factors surrounding demographics and changes in society and sort of single-family housing affordability and all those other factors. Those factors I think are going to continue to be favorable toward rental housing broadly and apartment housing specifically. So I think at this point, we don't see any real reason to expect that the demand side of the equation is going to pullback at all. And I think that as I say the one variable that's really hard to handicap right now is when those the next recession hit and to what degree this job growth get affected by that and how does it affect demand. No reason to see that coming anytime soon, but it's something we think about.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Thanks for the comments.
Operator: And our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Jeffries. Please go ahead.
Omotayo Okusanya: Hi. Good morning. For most of this year, I mean when I took a look at your supplemental you guys tend not to refer to larger markets versus secondary market that you used to pre -- the Post acquisition. I'm just thinking, do you still kind of think about your portfolio that way? And if you do, how do you kind of think about your smaller secondary market that regards to maintaining exposure there possibly selling down in some of those markets as you have over the past two years?
Eric Bolton: As a consequence of all the transformation that we've been through for the last really five years starting with Colonial, then with Post and then just the recycling of capital. We've really think about diversification and earnings balance in a different way now and really think about it mostly in terms of sort of A and B product trying to cater to a balanced price point in the market -- diversified price point in the market. And we think about it in terms of submarkets whether it's urban, interlude, suburban or more satellite city. And so that has increasingly begun to define sort of our portfolio and certainly, how we think about earnings diversification. I think that as we look at recycling capital more often than not it's driven by age factors and rising CapEx issues or moderating rent growth for whatever reason. And typically that translates into older assets or assets neighborhoods that have got some age on it, it's reached a point in the lifecycle, what we think better to put that money out and redeploy it. And often when you look at our older assets they tend to be in some of these smaller cities that we've had for some time. So I think that as we think about recycling you may see us continue to exit some of these legacy smaller cities that we have, but that's really more of a function of just asset specific issues as opposed to any sort of strategy change or any diversification change.
Omotayo Okusanya: Got it. Alright. Thank you.
Operator: And it appears there are no further questions over the phone at this time, I would like to go ahead and put it back to the speakers for any closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: Okay. Well thanks everyone for joining us. And I'm sure we'll see most of you next week at NAREIT. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-08-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, August 2, 2018. I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Priscilla, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Forward-Looking Statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and good morning. Leasing conditions across our markets continue to reflect strong demand for apartment housing. During the second quarter, we captured meaningful improvement in pricing with a blended lease-over-lease growth rate of 3.3%. This is 90 basis points better than Q2 of last year, and the best quarterly lease-over-lease rent growth captured since our merger with Post. Looking at pricing trends for new move-in residents on a lease-over-lease basis, where new supply and competition generate the highest pressure, we captured a significant 170-basis-point improvement over last year. Resident turnover remains at a historically low level, and rent growth of renewal leases during Q2 was a strong 5.9%. We believe pricing trends have reached an inflection point, and we expect to see positive momentum over the next several quarters. We're encouraged with the positive momentum in rent growth and believe this will support the stronger revenue growth that we expect to capture over the second half of the year. We continue to capture very favorable performance in year-over-year growth and operating expenses. As a result of the improving pricing trends and continued favorable expense performance, we continue to be comfortable with our outlook for same-store NOI performance. I'm particularly encouraged by the emerging and improving trends in pricing performance across the legacy Post portfolio. As our work over the past year to strengthen and reconcile revenue management practices takes hold through this year's leasing season, we are beginning to capture the positive impact. This is despite the fact that many of the legacy Post submarkets are currently battling some of the more challenging new supply pressures across our portfolio. We're thrilled with the associates we now have in place at our legacy Post locations, and I very much appreciate they're hanging there with us as we work through the merger and reconciliation of on-site operating practices. Merger-related activities continue to wind down. During July, we successfully wrapped up the final systems conversion work and completed the consolidation of the legacy MAA and legacy Post operations onto one management and reporting platform. This has meant a significant effort by every part of our company. We're excited to have this effort behind us, and to now be in a position to further harvest opportunities associated with being on one operating reporting system. As outlined in our earnings release, acquisition activity remains fairly quiet for us as aggressive pricing keeps us largely on the sidelines. We did initiate two new development projects during the second quarter, both of which are expansions of existing properties. Each project is located on land parcels adjacent to existing communities that we already owned. In summary, while we still have a few months of a busy leasing season ahead of us, I'm encouraged with the performance and progress year-to-date. We continue to believe that the back half of the year will play out in line with our expectations. We continue to capture great early benefits from our merger with Post in the area of operating expenses and G&A synergy, and improving pricing trends are now clearly evident. While new supply pressures are currently creating some headwind, our revenue management practices and the improvements made in the legacy Post portfolio operation are beginning to make an impact. Merger integration activities are essentially complete, and we now look forward to now executing on a fully consolidated platform. We continue to believe that based on permitting data and projected new starts as well as what we are seeing on the ground in our various submarkets that we will see some moderation in new supply pressure in a number of our markets in 2019. With continued strong employment expectations, we're optimistic that leasing conditions across our footprint will continue to see positive momentum. I want to thank all our MAA associates for their hard work through this busy summer season and their focus in not only serving our residents on a daily basis, but also completing the extra work and effort associated with wrapping up our conversion and consolidation activities associated with our merger. That concludes my comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Grimes: Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our operating performance for the second quarter came in as expected with building momentum in rent growth, continued strong occupancy and overall trends that support our outlook for the year. The integration work on the operating platform was evident in our leasing during the quarter. We saw blended lease-over-lease performance of the combined portfolio grow 3.3% in the second quarter, which is a 170 basis points higher than the first quarter and 90 basis points higher than the same time last year. Encouragingly, Post blended lease-over-lease pricing was up 2.5% during the second quarter, which is a strong 210 basis points better performance than this time last year. This steady positive trend in blended price drove down our - drove our sequential average effective rent up 1% from Q1 to Q2. This is the highest sequential increase we have seen since the Post merger. This improving pricing performance is primarily the result of new lease pricing on the Post portfolio. Despite the fact that Post submarkets are experiencing heavy new supply, we saw new lease-over-lease rates improve by a significant 350 basis points in the second quarter from the same time last year. Expense performance continues to be a bright spot for both portfolios. While improvement in revenue management practices are just now showing up in pricing, our programs to more aggressively operating expenses have shown more immediate results. Overall, expenses within the same-store portfolio were up just 1.1% for the quarter. Total expenses on the Post portfolio during the quarter were down 1.8%. That was driven by reductions in personnel costs, repair and maintenance expenses as well as property and casualty insurance. As a result, the second quarter operating margin for the Post portfolio improved another 90 basis points. This is on top of the 130-basis-point improvement we made in the second quarter of last year. We're pleased to see the rent growth improvement, which should further drive margin expansion within the Post portfolio. July results show the continued benefit of our consolidated platform and momentum. Overall same-store July blended lease-over-lease rates were up a strong 3.3%. Average daily occupancy for the month was 95.7%, and we ended the month at 96.1% and we'll start August at 96.1%. Our 60-day exposure, which represents all vacant units and notices for 60-day period is [indiscernible] which sets us up well for the slower winter leasing season. The supply [indiscernible] documented. Currently, Dallas and Austin are facing the most pressure. In 2018, we expect 22,000 deliveries in Dallas. And in Austin, we expect 8,000 deliveries. We're encouraged by the job growth that has remained strong in both markets. Dallas job growth for the last 12 months was 3.4% and Austin job growth was 3.3%. These growth trends are strong and well ahead of nationwide trends. Looking forward, deliveries in our market are expected to drop 18% in 2019, and with continued strong demand, we expect the leasing environment to improve next year. While elevated supply levels have pressured rent growth in several of our markets, particularly Dallas and Austin, we're seeing good revenue growth in a number of our markets. Phoenix, Richmond, Orlando and Jacksonville really stood out from the group. Our focus on customer service and retention coupled with strong renter demand continue to drive down resident turnover. Move-outs by our current residents continue to remain low. Move-outs for the overall same-store portfolio were down 2.7% for the quarter. Move-outs to home buying were down 4%. And move-outs to home renting remain an insignificant cause for turnover and accounts for only 7% of our move-outs. On a rolling 12-month basis, turnover dropped to a historic low of 49.2%. The steady decrease in turnover was achieved by increasing renewal rents by 5.9%. Momentum is building on the redevelopment program across the legacy Post portfolio. Through the second quarter, we've completed 1,400 units and expect to complete 3,000 this year. On average, we're spending about - we're spending $8,700 and getting a rent increase that is 11% more than compatible - a comparable non-redeveloped unit. As a reminder, we've identified 13,000 Post units that have compelling redevelopment opportunity. For the total portfolio, in 2018, we expect to complete over 8,000 interior unit upgrades. On the legacy MAA portfolio, we continue to have a robust redevelopment pipeline of 9,000 to 12,000 units. On a combined basis with the legacy Post portfolio, our total redevelopment pipeline now stands in the neighborhood of 22,000 to 25,000 units. Our active lease-up communities are performing well and in line with our expectations. Our remaining pipeline of leasing - lease-up properties, Acklen West End, The Denton II, Post Midtown, Post River North and Sync36 are all on track to stabilize on schedule. The stabilization date for Post South Lamar II was moved up a quarter to the third quarter of 2018 as it leased up faster than we originally planned. We're pleased to have the merger integration winding down. I'm proud of the effort and the hard work of our team - our team has put in over the last 18 months. The results are progressing as we expected. We're looking forward to continuing to capture value-creation opportunities on both revenue and expense sides of the equation as we move forward. Al?
Albert Campbell: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional commentary on the company's second quarter earnings performance, the balance sheet activity, and then finally, on our guidance for the remainder of 2018. Net income available for common shareholders was $0.52 per diluted common share for the quarter. FFO for the quarter was $1.55 per share, which was $0.07 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. Our core or same-store earnings results were in line with our expectations for the quarter. Same-store revenue growth for the second quarter was primarily based on effective rent growth of 1.7%, which was encouragingly 30 basis points above our reported growth in the first quarter. Average occupancy for the second quarter also remained strong at 96%, but was 10 basis points below the prior year, slightly offsetting rent growth. You may recall our first quarter revenue performance was enhanced by a 30 basis points year-over-year increase in occupancy, primarily built to support pricing during our busiest leasing season. And perhaps most importantly, as mentioned before, our blended lease-over-lease pricing growth for the second quarter, which is new and renewal leases combined, was 3.3%, which provides continued support to the momentum projected over the back half of this year. All this combined with a strong 1.1% expense performance, as Tom mentioned, produce same-store NOI growth of 1.7%, which is in line with our forecast expectation. Favorable FFO results for the second quarter were primarily produced by an unexpected settlement of a life insurance policy acquired with the Post merger, producing $0.04 per share favorability; favorable G&A and interest expenses for the quarter, another $0.02 per share combined; and finally, favorable timing of some remaining integration expenses, another $0.01 per share. Our total expectation for integration expenses for the full year remains unchanged, but certain lease costs are now being incurred in the third and fourth quarters. We also had $2.8 million of noncash income during the quarter related to the valuation of the preferred shares, which essentially offset the $2.6 million of noncash expense recorded during the first quarter, making the full year impact insignificant, which is in line with our previous guidance. And as a reminder, due to the uncertainty in forecasting this noncash item, our projections do not include any impact from valuation adjustments in our full year guidance for this item. During the second quarter, we closed on acquisition of one new high-end community, the 374-unit Sync36 located in Denver, which included the land parcel to develop an additional 79 units. We expect to begin additional units during the third quarter, which will bring the projected total investment in the community to about $128 million. Once the final phase is fully completed and leased, we expect a 5.6% NOI yield on this total project. We also continued to monetize non-core land parcels acquired with the Colonial merger. We closed on the disposition of 29-acre land parcel located in Las Vegas during the quarter. MAA received total proceeds of $9.5 million for the sale, producing a recorded gain of $2.8 million during the quarter. This brings total non-core land sales for the year from three parcels all acquired from Colonial containing 66 acres for total net proceeds of $15.2 million and recorded gains of $2.9 million for the year. During the second quarter, we began the construction of two expansion s of existing communities, Post Parkside at Wade Phase III located in Raleigh and Post Sierra at Frisco Bridges Phase II located in Dallas. We now have four communities under construction with a total projected cost of $219.8 million, of which $97 million remains to be funded. Once competed and fully leased, we do expect a stabilize NOI yield of 6.2% for the portfolio. As Tom mentioned, our lease-up portfolio continues to perform well. At the end of the quarter, we had six communities remaining in lease-up, including Sync36, which was acquired in lease-up during the quarter. Average occupancy for the group was just over 75% at quarter-end, and we expect two other communities to achieve full stabilization during the third quarter, which is 90% occupancy for 90 days. We expect two more to stabilize during the fourth quarter and the remaining two to stabilize in the first half next of year, all of which will provide a growing contribution to our 2019 earnings stream. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. During the second quarter, we issued $400 million in 10-year secured - excuse me, unsecured senior notes at 4.2% coupon rate. The proceeds from this issuance were used to pay down borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, bringing our combined cash and available borrowing capacity to $920 million at quarter-end. Our leverage defined by our bond covenants was only 33.1% at quarter-end, while our net debt-to-recurring-EBITDA was just over 5x. Finally, given the strong second quarter performance, we are maintaining and converting our same-store guidance for the full year as both revenue and expense trends continue to be in line with our previous projections. Expectations for the remainder of the year are built on continued strong occupancy, 96% average for the remainder of the year; and blended lease pricing, which is combined new and renewal leases averaging about 2.2% for the remainder of the year, which compares well to recent trends. We are increasing our net income and FFO per share guidance ranges for the full year to reflect the items mentioned earlier. We're also slightly narrowing our earnings guidance ranges to reflect the reduced uncertainty following two quarters of performance for the year. In summary, net income diluted common share is now projected to be $1.85 to $2.05 for the full year 2018. FFO is projected to be $5.96 to $6.16 per share or $6.06 per share at the midpoint, which includes $0.08 per share of projected final merger and integration costs related to Post merger. AFFO is now projected to be $5.35 to $5.55 per share and $5.45 at the midpoint. The third quarter FFO is projected to be $1.45 to $1.55 per share or $1.50 at the midpoint. We continue to remain on track to capture the full $20 million of overhead synergies related to the Post merger as well as the other NOI and earnings opportunities outlined with the merger, which are reflected in our current guidance. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments, Priscilla, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question today from Nick Joseph with Citi.
Nicholas Joseph: Just on the same-store revenue guidance. The maintained range implies a meaningful ramp in 2H versus year-to-date results, and thank you for the components that you just gave. But you trended towards the midpoint above or below? And then from a quarterly perspective, how do you expect it to trend in 3Q and 4Q?
Albert Campbell: I think we typically, lay our guidance out - Nick, this is Al, I'm sorry, we typically lay our guidance out trending towards the midpoint. And as we talked about, that performance is going to be based on pricing performance for the year, expected stable occupancy of around 96% average. And so our pricing guidance is 2.25% to 2.75% for the full year, which is new and renewals combined of blended leasing. And as we talked about, I think through July, we actually achieved 2.8%. And so that leaves about 2.2% on average for the remainder of the year, and I think it's about achievable.
Nicholas Joseph: And from a quarterly perspective, would you expect it to accelerate from 2Q to 3Q and then into 4Q?
Albert Campbell: I think we would expect - two things there. I think we would expect pricing to follow seasonal trends, which would be strong continued strength in the third quarter, seasonally softening in the fourth quarter. But the continued compounding of strong pricing performance into our portfolio will drive effective rent per unit, which is the average of all of your leases, at one time, that will continue to grow. We expect that to be growing in the third quarter and even more so in the fourth quarter to drive that rent performance - excuse me, the revenue performance close to the midpoint.
Nicholas Joseph: And then you had some 18% drop in delivery is expected next year. Which markets are projected to have the largest decrease? And then which will continue to see pressure?
Thomas Grimes: Nick, it's Tom. The trade-off is really across-the-board with only DC and Atlanta seeing slight increases. But it's really pretty widespread, and it's not being driven by any one market.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital.
Austin Wurschmidt: Just wanted to start off with a clarification. Al, I think you just mentioned 2.8%, which I thought you said was the blended lease rates for July. But in the release, I thought it said you achieved 3.3%. Can you just clarify those two numbers?
Albert Campbell: Yes, Austin, that's a great question. Let me clarify that. I was - 2.8% I was referring to the average for the full year, seven months together. And so we did achieved for the month of July of 3.3%, which shows that trend is growing.
Eric Bolton: 2.8%, year-to-date.
Albert Campbell: Yes, 2.8% year-to-date. I'm sorry. But month of July was 3.3%.
Eric Bolton: So the minimum is building.
Austin Wurschmidt: Got it. And can you kind of compare, you mentioned 2.2% needed to achieve the midpoint of guidance with sort of stable occupancy. How does that 2.2% compare? I guess, the first half, you answered the question largely in that 2.8% or just a little below that. But how does that also compare versus last year and the second half of 2017?
Eric Bolton: Nick, I mean, the last blended for 2017 was 1.6%, which is a bit of a fall off for us last year. We're assuming 2.2% going forward and feel pretty good about that. And that's what helps drive that compounding effective rent growth that Al was talking about in the back half of the year.
Albert Campbell: We do expect, and to your point, Austin, we do expect the fourth quarter to moderate seasonally. And so in the last year, our blended pricing portfolio was flat blended. And so we believe we'll exceed that - we project to exceed that this year and have a strong third quarter based on July and continue August [indiscernible] performance. For fourth quarter, we project it to moderate some with seasonality, but be above last year about 60 basis points or so.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. And then can you just give us a sense in terms of the backdrop of supply in the back half of the year? Do you expect it to ratchet down or ramp-up kind of portfolio-wide in the back half of this year before seeing a year-over-year decrease in '19?
Thomas Grimes: No, it's awfully consistent. Last year, again, we saw a real change in the volume of supply that occurred. This year that has been relatively consistent throughout the quarters and expect it to be pretty consistent the rest of the year.
Eric Bolton: Last year really saw a big ramp-up in the last several months, particularly in Dallas, particularly in the uptown.
Thomas Grimes: Correct, yes. And we don't expect that to occur this year, no.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. And then just one more for me on sort of the investment side. You talked and have repeatedly kind of discussed the challenges in the acquisition market due to competitiveness. But could we see a ramp, I guess, and the development pipeline or even a bigger ramp in the development program as you look to what opportunities you have to reinvest your available cash flow?
Eric Bolton: Austin, this is Eric. We're looking at a couple of other development opportunities, another adjacent land parcel that we own that we're looking at. We've got a couple of other sites and an existing own site in Denver, another site under contract, another site in Orlando under contract, another side in Raleigh under contract. These are all the things that if we do pull the trigger on some of these, it would be next year, frankly, before we would do that. So you're not going to see us create a really significant development pipeline. I think we've sort of laid out a parameter of no more than 3% or 4% of enterprise value, which is going to be in that $400 million to $500 million range for us. But we do continue to feel that, that ought to be part of our external growth story at some level going forward. What I'm encouraged by, frankly, is just while it's been frustrating on the acquisition front given where pricing is, we haven't been able to put much money to work. I will say though that our deal flow, our deal volume is higher in Q1 and in Q2. Year-to-date, it's higher than we've seen the last five years. So I mean, we are looking at a lot of things right now and continue to have a number of conversations with developers about prepurchase opportunities and sort of funding the development as we go things of that nature. So I continue to be encouraged [Technical Difficulty] later in the cycle that more opportunities are going to emerge. As I mentioned, the balance sheet's got - is in great shape. We've got a lot of capacity. We're going to stay disciplined. We're going to stay patient. But I continue to believe that the opportunities are going to emerge, which is going to facilitate our ability to pick up the pace of growth a little bit.
Operator: We'll go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.
Richard Anderson: So the pipeline of redevelopment 22,000 to 25,000 units, pretty substantial obviously. But I'm curious, first question is, are they - are there units within a community that are in that and others that are not in the same community? In other words, do you kind of identify a building with X number of units and that's a redevelopment opportunity? Or is there something about some buildings where some are redevelopable and some are not?
Thomas Grimes: Rich, in general, it is a property-by-property assessment. And the way that we figure out whether the market will accept that is through a pretty rigorous testing process that we do. But generally, it works on the property or it does not work on the property. Every now and then, there's a particularly a studio floor plan-type that maybe more sensitive to renovate than others and we might leave that out. But that, honestly, is a rarity. We pick the units, test the units and then roll forward on the property.
Eric Bolton: The only hesitation we ever have, we don't force turnover, so we do it on turns. I think if we start forcing turnover, we start driving up vacancy loss and we start impacting negatively the economics on the renovate program. But as Tom mentioned, it's really a more systematic approach, and it really affects our units at a given community for the most part.
Thomas Grimes: That's correct.
Richard Anderson: So that leads to my next question, you said, you don't force the process, but I guess, why not? I mean, if you have this great rent growth potential in front of you, not that you could force anything, but if you - someone's lease expires and you say, "Well, I'm going to raise your rent by kind of an above-market rate. And if they take it, great. If they don't, you've got a redevelopment opportunity right there. Is that something that you think about?
Thomas Grimes: Yes, I mean, we have considered that and thought about that. But those - what you mentioned are the pros to it's [Technical Difficulty] is strong now, 6% reprice, no additional investment, no downtime and average day is vacant and no turn costs. So we feel like that's - our approach is a little more stable.
Richard Anderson: Got you. Fair enough. Last question is for anyone in the room, the theme this quarter has been low turnover. You guys mentioned it, pretty much everybody is mentioning it. We have a pretty good economy. You would think people would be more inclined to look around and improve their residence to some degree. I'm curious what your thoughts are as why turnover is so low? Is it just simply housing market is sort of questionable, single family market? Or is it something else that's driving it down?
Eric Bolton: Rich, this is Eric. I think a couple of things at play here. One is what you referred to. I think the housing market in general is challenged increasingly by the lack of affordable single-family housing. I think we see the rental side of that business continue to really ratchet up with pretty high rent growth. We see pricing for starter homes continuing to move up. There's just not enough supply out there. And as a consequence, I think it is becoming increasingly more expensive. But I think the other thing that is at play here a little bit is just a more function of just demographic and society changes. If you look at our portfolio today, our resident profile, 75%, 76% of our rental profile is single, not married; 52%, 53% are female. And I just - I continue to believe that this is a demographic more so today than ever in the past. It's not really motivated to go out and move into a single-family home, whether that be for rent or for purchase. And so I think it's a combination of those factors right now that are sort of helping the industry as a whole to capture some pretty good retention.
Richard Anderson: I guess, if you're single you can't get divorced so.
Eric Bolton: That's right.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: I guess, one of the levers you have to maintain your same-store expense growth at 1.3% for the year is decline in building and maintenance cost of 6%. And I'm wondering if you're basically deferring some of these costs to future periods or capitalizing these costs to redevelopment? Or is that...
Thomas Grimes: Yes, we're doing neither of those, John. I mean, what really is driving at is putting our approach to repair and maintenance on a portfolio that was more heavily weighted to contracting out labor. At the end of the day, they did - drastically increasing the number of paints that we do in-house and the number of carpets that we do in-house, and the number of cleans that we have in-house, and that is 100% what is driving this. And certainly, nothing in the deferred maintenance or capitalizing those costs.
Eric Bolton: And I'll tell you the other thing that's been part of the equation as well is just the benefits of the economy of scale. I mean, we renegotiated virtually every single contract we have for procuring services and products that we use in the operation of on-site activities, and all those prices went down as a consequence of the scale we got too, so there's no deferral going on, I can assure you that. It's really the point that Tom mentioned and the scale advantage.
John Kim: So this is mostly attributable to Post integration?
Thomas Grimes: Right. Yes. That is right, yes.
Albert Campbell: Yes. We've been talking about that I think last several quarters, John, that was the first thing, it was really easiest for us to jump on begin with actually a little better and faster than we had expected. I think as we move into '19, we would expect that to normalize a bit, but the revenue opportunities are growing and will be contributing in 2019. So that's kind of how we think about it.
John Kim: Okay. And then the 3.3% blended growth rate you got in July, I know you kind of forecast a significant down a little bit in the second half of the year, but how much visibility do you have on August as far as renewal rates and new lease growth?
Thomas Grimes: Sure. I mean, limited like none on new lease, because obviously as we haven't executed enough to do that. But as far as our renewals, they're continuing to go out. August, September and October all went out in the 6% range, and we're getting back high 5% in that range. So we feel good about that part of the equation.
John Kim: So that's about 40 basis points lower than what you got in the second quarter. Is that correct?
Thomas Grimes: Yes. I mean, and I think we mentioned at NAREIT, 5.9%, we're really pleased with. But we didn't plan for that. And one shouldn't plan on 5.9% going forward.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Omotayo Okusanya: Could you talk a little bit about the markets where you are seeing still a lot of supply pressures? How these developers are competing? Are you seeing increased concessions? What are they kind of trying to do to kind of drive lease-up in their assets? And how is that impacting your portfolio?
Thomas Grimes: I would tell you, Tayo, you're hitting on it in places like Atlanta, Austin and Dallas. And just pockets of Atlanta, really, they're competing with concessions. I will tell you that as we mentioned on an earlier Q&A, we saw a heavy hit of new development in late last year, it ramped up. And what we are seeing now as far as concessions in the marketplace, in those kind of places, is generally better than it was at that time. So they're still doing a month, two months free. It really depends on the submarket and market there. But there you're seeing that with that's how they're competing, it's just upfront discounts of concessions.
Omotayo Okusanya: Got you. Okay. And then second of all, when we kind of think about the back half of the year, I think you guys have been done an amazing job just with managing OpEx growth. And your guidance seems to imply that, that's going to continue for the rest of the year. But are there any potential kind of headwinds there that could make that number go up in the back half of the year?
Albert Campbell: Tayo, this is Al. We don't see any significant headwinds, and we feel pretty confident in our current on guidance on expenses for the back half of the year. As mentioned, we would expect a lot of that's attributable to the favorable performance from achieving the Post synergies or opportunities, those scale and processes we talked about. So I think as we move into 2019, the repair and maintenance and some of those lines may moderate to a more normal level. And as we mentioned, I think we expect the revenue part of the synergies to pick up stronger at that point as well.
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay. And then just the last one for me, what's the latest kind of with the DC portfolio? How are trends for the quarter? How you're just kind of feeling about that portfolio since it's an outlier relative to your typical regional exposure?
Thomas Grimes: No, I mean, DC has been steady for us. Our blended lease-over-lease rate rents for that group were 2 7. We continue to be pleased with the teams there and the redevelopment opportunity. And it is steady as it goes in DC for us.
Operator: We'll move now to John Pawlowski with Green Street.
John Pawlowski: On the revamped portfolio, the incremental 4,000 units to be done the rest of this year, are those costs bought out or is there any construction cost risk?
Thomas Grimes: Those costs are not bought out, John. I mean, we have tagged them, but we're working with - I won't call, bought out, but fairly fixed pricing. And we have not seen the volatility in dealing with renovate upgrades there that we have - that I think the industry has experienced on construction costs. It's just - It has not been a factor or a risk of our return.
John Pawlowski: On the broader pipeline, the 22,000 to 25,000, I guess, how is it completely new? You said labor shortages, so material inflation outpacing rent growth. So if the current environment persists, how do the economics trend on the broader pipeline in the next couple of years if construction cost broadly are outpacing inflation by a wide margin?
Thomas Grimes: Yes. I mean, I would tell you we don't have lumber in that number, we don't have concrete in that number and we don't have steel in that number. It's really appliances; in some cases, a countertop. And in sort of reskinning it [Technical Difficulty] and I think that's probably why it's different. I understand your point. It's well made. We just don't have a history of those costs trending in line with construction costs.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Makes sense. And the comments on supply being down nearly 20% next year, could you give us the one minute overview of how you identify what's competitive new supply and what's not competitive? Because candidly, when you roll up the market level permitting, which I know it's not great, but it does provide a directional proxy for supply growth, it doesn't paint the picture for anything near a 20% drop in the supply in '19. And 2020 looks pretty painful as well.
Thomas Grimes: Yes. I mean, what we're doing there is looking at the AXIO data over our broad markets, and then adding all of those markets up and comparing them. So this is not an asset-by-asset buildup, but it is a market buildup using that data.
Eric Bolton: I mean, we check it for reasonableness by - I mean, we know what's happening obviously in our submarkets and our properties know what's under construction. I think it's pretty easy to get a pretty good sense of what's going to happen 12 months out or so, because if it's not under construction now, it's not going to deliver next year and we know that. I do share your opinion that as you start to look at what's happening with permitting, it starts to suggest that 2020, maybe 2021, we might see a reacceleration of deliveries. But when you look at just - if it's not under construction now, it's not going to deliver next year. So we do think that '19 is shaping up to be a better year in terms of supply pressure. But I think beyond next year, I think it starts to get a little bit more questionable.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.
Wesley Golladay: Just want to go back to the revenue guidance for the year, looking at the blended rent change. Assuming you're tracking a little bit above last year, you get to the high teens in 3Q. You'll probably need about 1.5% blended rent growth, if my math is correct, in 4Q. And it sounds like that will all be driven a little bit better new leasing; last year you were flat for the blend, and you highlighted to some degree that there's a lot of disruptive supply in 4Q in the select market, it sounds like the supply will not be as disruptive this year, but do you think you can get a materially better new lease growth in 4Q?
Albert Campbell: Yes. One thing I'll mention as you talk about your math and doing that is keep in mind though that the second quarter, there were a lot of leases that was signed in the second quarter. So simple average won't quite get you there. I think it's a little bit a better picture or a lower picture for the fourth quarter if you consider the weighted average because there were like a number of leases in the third quarter. But in general, I think you outlined it correctly.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. And that, I guess, last year, do you have a sense of how much the market such as uptown, I think maybe the other markets hit you. How much does that bring the overall new lease down? Was it a few percent just in those few markets alone for the overall portfolio impact?
Thomas Grimes: Those markets, it's down - I don't have the exact breakdown. But particularly, the way the Dallas supply hit last year was impactful.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back today for any closing or additional remarks.
Eric Bolton: Well, thanks, everyone. We appreciate you joining the call this morning. Any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to us. Thanks and we'll talk with everyone later. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-05-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, May 3, 2018. I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Savannah, and good morning. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I would like to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with the copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and good morning. First quarter results were slightly ahead of our expectation and reflect the continued solid demand for apartment housing across our markets. Occupancy is high, and rent growth on renewing leases is strong. However, elevated levels of new supply continue to weigh on our ability to drive rent growth on leases written for new residents. We expect the supply pressures will persist through most of this year, with trends moderating in 2019. But as we enter this busy summer leasing season, we are encouraged, with the number of trends that we are capturing, and continue to believe that revenue trends have bottomed out for the cycle. Our expectations, moving forward, are supported by favorable trends in several key variables. These include the continued strong job growth and demand for our apartment housing across our markets; our high occupancy levels; the strong performance being captured on renewal lease pricing; the improving pricing trends within the legacy Post portfolio; and finally, the continued strong performance on same-store operating expenses and continued improvement in operating margins. While supply pressures will remain evident in several of our markets for the next few quarters, continued favorable results in these key areas support belief, our belief, that we should see incremental improvement in NOI, moving forward, with better momentum in 2019 and supply pressures moderate. Resident turnover remains very low at 49.6% on a running 12-month basis. This is despite continued healthy growth in renewal lease pricing of 5.5% during the first quarter. This level of strong pricing performance in the face of higher new supply is a testament to not only the continued healthy demand for apartment housing in our markets, but is also a very positive statement about the quality of service provided by our on-site associates, and I really appreciate their efforts. The leasing pressures associated with higher levels of new development continue to mostly impact the higher rent properties in more urban-oriented submarkets within the portfolio. However, it's worth noting that the overall blended rent growth on leases signed in the first quarter within the more urban-oriented legacy Post portfolio did improve by 190 basis points, as compared to the first quarter of last year. As new supply pressures moderate, we believe the opportunity within the legacy Post portfolio for accelerated rent growth, as a result of both the execution of our revenue management practices and a meaningful redevelopment opportunities in the portfolio, will support much improved performance trends. As noted in the earnings release, our progress associated with managing operating expenses continue to drive strong results. Tom will cover more details in his comments, but we have been pleased with the early results within the legacy Post portfolio, as our various operating practices are fully implemented. And the efficiencies associated with our larger scale are making a positive impact on overall portfolio operating margins. Over the course of the summer, we expect to wrap up the work associated with the back-office and systems integration associated with our merger with Post. As we continue to refine and capture the benefits associated with having both portfolios on the same operating platform as well as accelerate the unit interior redevelopment effort, the value accretion that we've previously outlined within the Post -- for the Post merger is something we continue to feel confident about. As noted in our earnings release, during April, we closed on a property acquisition located in Denver. This off-market acquisition of this newly developed property was negotiated late last year, with the closing subject to the completion of the construction of Phase 1 of the project. The property is located adjacent to a recently approved new light rail station that will connect to downtown Denver, and located adjacent to high-end restaurant and retail shopping venues. This is a high-quality property in a terrific location that is a great addition to our Denver portfolio. We expect to get underway with the Phase 2 expansion of the property later this year. We continue to see heavy deal flow with our underwriting and transaction volume, reaching a 5-year high for the typically slower first quarter of the year. I continue to believe that as we work further into the cycle of new property deliveries, the capacity and optionality surrounding our balance sheet, along with our proven execution capabilities will yield increasing opportunity for our earnings-accretive external growth. In summary, we like to start to the year, and continue to believe 2018 will play out along the lines we expected. Demand remains high. Resident retention is strong, and rent trends looked to have stabilized. We're excited to be nearing completion of the final steps in fully integrating all operating and reporting activities of the legacy MAA and Post portfolios, and we remain very enthused about the long-term value proposition surrounding the merger. I appreciate all the hard work that our team has done over the past year in stabilizing our platform, and we look forward to the opportunity in front of us with the important summer leasing season. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our operating performance came in as expected. Revenues for the first quarter were 1.8% over prior year, with 96.3 average daily occupancy and 1.4% effective rent growth. Expenses increased just 1.6% over the prior year, and NOI increased by 1.9%. Looking at revenue drivers by portfolio in the first quarter, as compared to the prior year, a legacy MAA portfolio generated revenue growth of 2.3% with 96.4 average daily occupancy and effective rent growth of 1.8%. The legacy Post portfolio had 0.4% revenue growth, with 95.8% average daily occupancy and 0.2% effective rent growth. Supply has been elevated in our markets for several quarters. Despite the supply headwinds, we saw the blended lease-over-lease performance of the combined company grow by 1.6% in the first quarter, which is 40 basis points higher than the same time last year. This is primarily driven -- this is primarily the result of new lease pricing on the Post portfolio, which improved by a significant 260 basis points in the first quarter from the same time last year. This is further supported by improving monthly trends during the quarter. Blended pricing growth for the overall same-store portfolio on January was 0.7%; February, 1.8%; and March, 2.2%. Expense performance continues to be a bright spot for both portfolios. While improvements in revenue management practices are just now showing up in pricing, our programs to more aggressively manage operating expenses have shown more immediate results. Overall expenses within the same-store portfolio were up just 1.6%. This includes the $900,000 of winter storm related cost incurred during the quarter. Adjusting for storm cost, our expense increased less than 1%. Total expenses on the Post portfolio during the quarter were down 2.2%. That was driven by reductions in personnel cost, repair and maintenance expenses as well as property and casualty insurance. As a result, the first quarter operating margin of the Post portfolio improved another 90 basis points. This is on top of the 130 basis point improvement we made in first quarter of last year. We still have room to run with our expense management programs on the legacy Post portfolio, and expect continued progress in 2018. Our operating disciplines are now fully in place, and at current run rate, the savings will continue. April results show the benefit of our consolidated platform and momentum. Overall same-store average daily occupancy in April was 96.2%, which is 10 basis points higher than the prior year. This is driven by a 50 basis point year-over-year improvement in the legacy Post portfolio. Overall, the same-store April blended lease-over-lease rates were up 2.9%, which is 90 basis points better than blended rents in April last year. Our 60-day exposure, which represents all vacant units and notices for a 60-day period, is a low 8.3% and in line with prior year. The supply picture is well documented. Dallas and Austin are facing the most pressure. In 2018, we expect 22,000 deliveries for Dallas, and in Austin, we expect 8,400 deliveries. We're encouraged that job growth has remained strong in both markets. Dallas job growth was at 2.5% in 2017, and expected to increase to 2.6%. Austin job growth was 3.3% in 2017, and expected to remain robust again at 3.3% in 2018. These growth trends are strong, and well ahead of nationwide trends. All elevated supply levels have pressured rent growth in several of our markets. We're seeing good growth in a number of markets, Phoenix, Richmond, Orlando and Jacksonville stood out from the group. Our focus on customer service and retention is paying dividends. Move-outs by our current residents continue to remain low. Move-outs for our overall same-store portfolio were down 2.3% for the quarter. Move-outs to home-buying were down 3%, and move-outs to home-renting were essentially flat with last year. Home renting remains an insignificant cost for turnover and accounts for less than 6% of our move-outs. On a rolling 12-month basis, turnover dropped to a historic low of 49.6%. The steady decrease in turnover was achieved while increasing renewal rents by 5.5%. Momentum is building on the redevelopment program across the legacy Post portfolio. In 2017, we completed renovation on 1,700 units. We've completed an additional 560 in the first quarter, and expect to complete 3,000 units this year. On average, we are spending $9,400 in getting the rent increase to this 11% more than a comparable non-redeveloped unit. As a reminder, we've identified a total of 13,000 Post units that have compelling redevelopment opportunity. For the total portfolio, in 2018, we expect to complete over 8,000 interior unit upgrades. On the legacy MAA portfolio, we continue to have a robust redevelopment pipeline of 10,000 to 12,000 units. On a combined basis with the legacy Post portfolio, our total redevelopment pipeline now stands in the neighborhood of 25,000 units. As you can tell from the release, our active lease-up communities are performing well in Houston, Post at Afton Oaks, stabilized in the first quarter, as expected. Our remaining pipeline of lease-up properties, the Denton II, Post South Lamar II, Post Midtown, Post River North and Acklen West End are all on track to stabilize on schedule. We have begun leasing Post Centennial Park in Atlanta. 2017 was a year of significant change for our organization. We started 2017 with 2 completely operating platforms and teams. We're pleased with the bulk of the integration work. The Post portfolio is behind now us. We have started 2018 with a much more aligned and cohesive operating platform and team. Results are progressing as expected. We look forward to continuing to capture value-creation opportunities on both the revenue and expense sides of the equation, as we finalize full integration activities in 2018. Al?
Albert Campbell: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's first quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity, and then finally, on guidance for the remainder of 2018. Net income available for common shareholders was $0.42 per diluted common share for the quarter. FFO for the quarter was $1.44 per share, which was $0.01 per share above the midpoint of our guidance. First quarter performance included $0.02 per share of noncash expense from the valuation of the embedded derivative related to the deferred shares issued in the Post merger, and this was not included in our original guidance. Same-store performance, G&A expense and interest expense were all slightly better than expected, and combined to produce the out-performance for the first quarter. During the first quarter, we did not acquire any communities. We did, however, close on the disposition of 2 land parcels acquired in the Colonial merger for $5.9 million in total proceeds. These sales produced net gains of about $200,000 recorded during the quarter. As Eric mentioned, in April, we closed on the acquisition of Saint 36, a 374-unit, high-end community located in Denver. The acquisition included a land parcel to develop an additional 79 units as part of the Phase 2 expansion, which we expect to begin later in 2018. Including the Phase 2 expansion, the total investment is expected to be approximately $128 million. Following quarter end, we also closed on a disposition of an additional land parcel located in Las Vegas for total proceeds of $9.5 million, which will produce a $2.8 million gain that will be recognized during the second quarter. Also, during the first quarter, we completed construction of one of our development communities, Post River North, located in Denver. The community was complete on plan with a total investment of $88.2 million and is expected to be stabilized in early 2019 at a 6.4% NOI yield. We currently have 2 communities remaining under construction with a total projected cost of $125.8 million, of which all but $24.4 million was funded as of quarter end. Including Post River North, our lease-up portfolio now contains 5 communities, totaling 1,509 units. Average occupancy for the group was 56.1% at quarter end. We expect 4 lease communities to stabilize in the second half of this year, and the remaining community to stabilize in the first half of 2019 at an overall average stabilized NOI yield of 6.4%, which will ultimately produce over $21 million of NOI. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. During the first quarter, we paid off an additional $38 million of secured debt, pushing our unencumbered NOI to over 85%. We also executed $300 million of forward interest rate hedges to secure future bond financings projected for later this year. At quarter end, our leverage is determined by our bond covenants, was only 33.1%, while our net debt-to-recurring-EBITDA was just over 5x. We also had almost $600 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility at quarter end. Finally, we are maintaining and confirming our outstanding guidance for all major components of our forecast, including net income, FFO, AFFO, same-store performance and transaction volumes. In summary, net income per diluted common share is projected to be $1.78 to $2.08 for the full year 2018. FFO is projected to be $5.85 to $6.15 per share or $6 per share at the midpoint, which includes $0.08 per share of projected final merger and integration cost related to Post merger. AFFO is projected to be $5.24 to $5.54 per share or $5.39 midpoint. For the second quarter, FFO is projected to be $1.43 to $1.53 per share or $1.48 per share at the midpoint. While we expect the continued volatility related to the valuation of the deferred shares acquired with the Post merger, our projections do not include any further valuation adjustments over the remainder of the year, as these adjustments are both noncash and impossible to predict. We remain on track to capture the full $20 million of overhead synergies related to the Post merger as well as other NOI and earnings opportunities outlined with the merger, which are reflected in our current guidance this year. That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Savannah, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We can take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi.
Nicholas Joseph: You did 1.8% same-store revenue growth in the first quarter and full year guidance is for 2% at the midpoint. And I know you've talked about an acceleration throughout the year, so I just want to get a sense of the pace, how do you expect it to trend? And do you expect 4Q same-store revenue at the high end of full year guidance around 2.2%?
Albert Campbell: Nick, this is Al. I will say, in general, as we've talked about before, what -- forecast is built on this year is really a few major components. Occupancy remaining strong at 96% through the year, certainly, through the back part of the year. Renewal pricing being consistent, 5%, 5.5%, and then new lease pricing being the key to that performance over the back half of the year. We have discussed that we do expect new lease pricing to be above prior year, and that will drive blended pricing -- I think for the remainder of the year, what we would expect to see was some more in the 70, 80 basis points range to capture our guidance at the midpoint. I'll tell you, though, in the first quarter of the year, we've captured 40% -- 40 basis points improvement over the prior year, as Tom mentioned. And April, actually, was much better than that at 90 basis points. And so we feel very good about the trend and the prospects, and so far what we lined up and outlined for guidance, we're right on track.
Nicholas Joseph: But then from a same-store year-over-year basis by the end of the year, you should be towards the top end of the guidance [indiscernible] acceleration.
Albert Campbell: That's right. [indiscernible] The revenue -- good point. The revenue based on that would build, as we went through second quarter, would still be on the lower end. It would grow in the third and fourth more significantly.
Nicholas Joseph: And then just wanted to get your view on the Houston market. We saw same-store revenue growth in the first quarter. Actually, a little lower year-over-year than what we saw in the fourth quarter, so just what you're seeing there today?
Thomas Grimes: Yes, and Nick, it's Tom. Last year, we ran with high occupancy and negative rent growth. As you know, the hurricane changed that a bit, and it takes time for the revised pricing to be replaced on each unit. So just to give you a flavor for what's coming, April blended rents in Houston were up 7.5%, and we think revenues will continue to fall. We just need that repricing to get on through the system.
Operator: And we can go next to Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Austin Wurschmidt: As it relates to supply, you guys have laid out a table in your investor deck that showed quarterly supply growth by market and indicated some fairly significant decreases by quarter. I was just curious, one, do you still think that that's the case that we should see it ratchet down, I guess, each quarter throughout the year? Or have you seen some of that pushed, I guess, later into the year? And then second, do you think you're already feeling the impact from some of that supply, as properties tend to lease prior to completion?
Eric Bolton: Yes, I mean, the answer to your question is yes. We do think that some of the supply based on the most recent and updated information we have appears to be slipping a little bit later into the year. And yes, you're right, we do begin to see some of the pressure on, particularly, as I've mentioned, the new lease pricing prior to the actual deliveries of the unit, as pre-leasing activity starts up. But I will tell you that the slippage, if you will, of some of the supply until later in the year in some respects is not such a worrisome thing in the sense that it's slipping into the more robust time of the year for leasing anyway. What was really a problem last year, is we saw slippage take place in the third quarter with deliveries that we thought would happen in the third quarter move into the fourth quarter, which of course is the worst leasing quarter of the year. So moving some of the Q1 deliveries into Q2, Q3 is not such a bad thing, given that leasing activity is more robust. Having said that, I also want to quickly mention, while the revision that we're seeing on supply being pushed out a little bit is accompanied by also a higher job growth forecast than what we started the year with, we've seen job growth pick up on a blended basis about 40 basis points more than we expected starting this year. So while the supplies picture is moving around a little bit in terms of timing, we're encouraged with continued healthy demand and job growth taking place, which I think is going to be helpful.
Austin Wurschmidt: Any particular markets where -- that job growth? Or the big drivers of the improved job growth outlook?
Tim Argo: Yes, Austin. This is Tim. I mean, I'm really seeing Austin and Dallas push up which is -- they've been drivers now for a few years, and they just continue to be job engines that will be helpful as our -- obviously, 2 of our larger markets.
Austin Wurschmidt: All right. And then as far as expenses, clearly, another quarter of expense savings from Post, and really kept expense levels low. As revenue ratchet higher through the year, should we think about expenses also ratcheting a little bit higher? Or do you think that maybe the initial outlook is a little bit conservative and that you're finding continued opportunity to keep that kind of towards the lower end of the range on the full year guide?
Albert Campbell: Austin, this is Al. I would say we feel good about the guidance that we have for full year for expenses, which is 1.5% to 2.5%. Now with the first quarter at 1.6%, that would tell you that what we're expecting on the remaining 3 quarters is somewhere around 2%, maybe a little up north of 2%, blended for the back half of the year. I think that's what would we expect overall.
Eric Bolton: If something else obviously, some of the early wins we were getting on the expense side began showing up early in the last half of last year. So the comps, the comparisons to prior year get a little tougher as we get towards the back half of the year. The absolute savings continues, but the comps just get a little bit hard, which will of course affect year-over-year results.
Austin Wurschmidt: I appreciate that. And then just last one for me, on the $128 million total investment on the Denver deal, can you give us the breakout between Phase 1 and Phase 2 as well as what the going in yield on that deal was, and then what you ultimately expect it will be on stabilization?
Eric Bolton: Well, the Phase 1 was something approaching $94 million.
Albert Campbell: It's $104 million.
Eric Bolton: $104 million, and the balance is what we expect to spend...
Albert Campbell: $148 million overall.
Eric Bolton: Yes, what we expect to spend on Phase 2. The stabilized yield that we expect to get out of this project is upper-5 range, as it gets -- Phase 2 gets fully built out and leased up. So we, as I mentioned in my comments, it's an incredible location. And we think that as we continue to build out our Denver presence, we think this is going to be a great addition. But we expect to be in the upper-5 range on the stabilized NOI yield on this deal over the next couple of years or so.
Austin Wurschmidt: So does that put Phase 2 at north of a 6% yield on a stand-alone basis?
Albert Campbell: Yes. The Phase 2 is a smaller 79 unit, as you can -- you can do the math on that, which will be a very efficient addition because it will use most of the amenities and things from Phase 1 obviously.
Eric Bolton: And the Phase 1 was about 68% occupied when we bought it, so that'll give you an indication of sort of the initial yield.
Operator: And we can go next to Rob Stephenson with Janney.
Robert Stevenson: Other than this Phase 2 on the newly-acquired asset, what other land are you controlling these days for future development? And how much of that you're thinking is going to start within the next 12-or-so months?
Eric Bolton: We have parcels already that we own in Fort Worth, in McKinney, North Dallas, satellite city in North Dallas, McKinney, Texas, and we have a site in Cherry Creek submarket in Denver. We would expect potentially to be underway with all of that very late this year, maybe a little bit. The Cherry Creek site may slip into early next year, but we're still working to predevelopment on those 3 opportunities. We also control opportunities, another opportunity, and also, we have a phase 3 opportunity in Raleigh, North Carolina with an existing property that we will likely pull the trigger on later this year. In addition to that, we have another site in Denver that we are working that we have on the contract. And we also have a site in Orlando that we are working on.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. I mean, from a timing standpoint, I mean, it sounds like that most of this is going to wind up being either late '18 or '19 starts, which means that, basically, I would imagine then that there's basically the expectation to little to no deliveries at all in '19, is that correct?
Eric Bolton: That's correct.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then, Tom, any markets that -- you're 1/3 of the way through the year now that you're seeing might be a little bit stronger, a little bit weaker than you guys were initially expecting?
Thomas Grimes: Yes. Honestly, Rob, not out of the shoot. I mean, we expected headwinds in Dallas and Austin and those are there. But we're pleased with the job growth there and then very pleased with places like Phoenix and Orlando right now.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then, Al, one last one for you. In terms of the hard cost on unit turnover, what are you guys spending these days?
Albert Campbell: I think it's around $1,000 per unit with -- $1,000, $1,200, all on things depending on whether you replace carpet or not. That's a big factor in there. I think that pushes it at the high end if you replace carpet. You do that every 5 years or so, and so I think that's roughly what we would say today.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And given the reduced level of turnover, are you able to do that with the existing Mid-America staff? Or you're having to bring in outside contractors to do that?
Eric Bolton: And that's one of the key things that has helped us with the Post portfolio is we're handling close to 80% of those turns in-house, meaning, sort of paint and carpet cleaning. The carpet installation and replacement, the capital item that Al mentioned, we contract that out. By comparison, Post really use contract labor for the overwhelming majority of their paint and carpet cleans.
Operator: And we can go next to Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill: First question, can you give a couple of steps around new leases? I think you had said the Post new leases were up 260 bps year-over-year. Can you just fill in the holes as far as what new lease was for the overall portfolio, and then maybe the pieces and then how that trended versus 1Q '17?
Thomas Grimes: Yes, sure. New lease rates were, for the first quarter, combined same-store, new lease was negative 2.3, renewal, 5.5; blended, 1.6. And then for April, new lease rates are 10 basis points positive. Renewals are 5.6, and blended, 2.9. And then just on roughly on a blended basis, to save some math, but I'll go into detail if you want it, first quarter was up 40 basis points versus last year on blended, and April is up 90 basis points.
Dennis McGill: Got it. And then I guess the only question within that, so Post new leases, I think you said were up 260 basis points year-over-year.
Thomas Grimes: That's correct.
Dennis McGill: What did the legacy MAA do in the first quarter on new?
Thomas Grimes: Legacy MAA on blended -- you said new lease rates?
Dennis McGill: Right.
Thomas Grimes: Bear with me just a second. MAA new lease rates were about flat for the quarter.
Dennis McGill: Perfect. Second question, you know that the operating platforms will be finalized on the synergy later this year. Where will we see the most obvious benefits once that's done either expense-wise or revenue-wise?
Eric Bolton: Well, I will tell you, it gets a little hard to point to specific things. Generally, a lot of the expense savings that we hope to get as a result of just renegotiating a lot of contracts and services for various services and supplies and products that we use, and that really wasn't so much a function of the systems conversion and consolidation effort, if you will. I will tell you, on the revenue side is where I think the opportunity comes from in terms of where the opportunity is as a result of putting both companies on the same platform. We, frankly, just get more efficient in how we manage the company. Right now, our regional leadership and -- are working with two different systems and having to look at two different sets of reports, and our LRO or revenue management system is not as fully optimized because of having to, if you will, still interface with two versions of our property management software. So there's lot of inefficiencies, frankly, that we have in terms of just how we manage the business by having the portfolios on 2 different systems. And I think as a consequence, and we're about halfway through the conversion process at this point. We'll wrap up here in another 90 days or so. And I think it ultimately just gets to a point where we have more efficiency now. The other thing that comes from this is, frankly, with the new system, we're introducing a little bit more robust activity as it relates to sort of web-based activities as a new consolidated web platform that is being finalized, and so it's a lot of things. A lot of them are subtle. But in aggregate, we think it just creates a lot more ability to bring intensity to the things that we really want to focus on as opposed to a lot of focus on putting systems together. We sort of are able to, if you will, get back to work in a much more intense fashion as a consequence of the merger.
Albert Campbell: I might just add to that too if the question is what is remaining to capture from those opportunities. Then one of the things we've talked about is the redevelopment. Remember, we're capping that over three years or so, and the plan this year to capture 1/3 of that. So it will take several years to roll that off to see that portfolio opportunity out at the pace we're doing this. So there are several things that will keep providing opportunity for us in the future.
Dennis McGill: And when you flip the switch in 90 days or so, and you're on the same platform, how long will it take you after that to get to a stabilized, fully efficient run rate on the revenue management?
Eric Bolton: I think it's happening. I think it will be instant, frankly. I think it happens. What remaining little inefficiencies we have sort of dissipates as a consequence of finally being on the same system.
Thomas Grimes: And Dennis, Dennis, what I would tell you is, I think most of the benefit of the revenue management system on the Post portfolio, we're really beginning to capture that now, and you're seeing that in the new lease rates, and just be streamline reporting and quicker reacting.
Dennis McGill: Okay, great. And then just last question, Eric, you talked to turnover being at historic lows, and we're seeing that not just across the multi-family space, but pretty much all of housing. Any thoughts from your perspective how much of that is changing consumer behavior versus not having anywhere to go because of inventory constraint?
Eric Bolton: I think that a lot of it is a change in behavior. I think that we certainly continue to see average age, average income continue to move up -- within our resident portfolio over the last couple of years. We continue to see the percentage of female versus male continue to move up as a consequence of the last two or three years with the trend. Certainly, the ability to go out and buy a starter home is more challenging, and I'm sure that factors into it to some degree. But I think -- I continue to believe that a lot of it is more social, and more about just our behavior patterns of our resident profile as much as it is anything.
Thomas Grimes: And Dennis, we've seen our single rate go up about 1 percentage point, which indicates supporting sort of Eric's point, we're not seeing people get married and sort of be backlogged in the unit in some way, shape or form, assuming that a married couple is more likely to buy a house than single.
Operator: And we can go next to Nick Yulico with UBS.
Trent Trujillo: This is Trent Trujillo, on with Nick. I just wanted to circle back. I appreciate all the comments that you had on supply. Just wanted to circle back on that topic both. So given peak supply across your market, you said in first quarter, plus some slippage that maybe you're experiencing it right now, can you speak to the level of concessions you're seeing across some of your larger urban market of, perhaps, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and D.C., and how that's trended since the start of the year?
Eric Bolton: Sure, Trent. And I'll just move well through it with Atlanta and going down at concessions. It's really about submarket in Atlanta. We've got 1 to 2 months free in Buckhead and Midtown. There are pockets of 1-month free, depending on specific lease-up places, like Roswell Road in 285 or the perimeter, has a little bit of pressure with 1 month outside the perimeter. Concessions are really pretty rare there. In Austin, we've got -- we see sort of 1 month in Cedar Park, which is north area and in South Austin. The tightest part is -- or the most pressured is sort of that South Congress Lamar corridor, and we're seeing 6 weeks to 2 months there. That's pretty similar with what we saw earlier. And then in -- and in Dallas, we're seeing 1 to 2 months in Frisco, Plano and Richardson. Uptown is running close to 6 weeks, which is actually slightly better than what we saw previously. It was running closer to 2 months. And uptown supply is about 2,000 units, which is about -- we expect that in '18, which is about what it was in '17.
Trent Trujillo: And perhaps, regarding acquisitions, how competitive is the transaction market, and can you speak to the amount of deals you're currently considering? I think earlier, Rob had mentioned something about the land sites that you were looking at. But I think, last quarter, you mentioned you had quite a few acquisition deals under review, but just the 1 closed in the Denver market after quarter end, so any commentary on that would be helpful.
Eric Bolton: Yes. I mean, the transaction market is incredibly competitive. We, as I mentioned in my call comments, we -- I mean, the number of deals that we underwrote in the first quarter is the highest we've had in over 5 years in the first quarter, which is typically a very slow quarter for deal activity. So we continue to see a lot of volume. But we've seen cap rates, if anything, over the last 6 months move down a little bit. I mean, routinely, you're in 4.5 to 4.75 range in some of the bigger markets, and you're low 5 -- 5 to 5.25, and perhaps, some of the smaller markets has more capital, and continues to weigh into some of these more, if you will, non-coastal markets or more secondary markets. So it's incredibly competitive. And we continue to remain active in the market, but believe that based on the hurdles and the disciplines that we're holding ourselves accountable for in terms of any capital deployment that -- where the pricing is right now, it's just hard to really justify some of the pricing that we see happening. And so we're going to remain patient, frankly, as we think that -- as we get a little later into the cycle. I think later this year, supply trends being what they are, that the opportunities may get a little bit more favorable, but it's pretty competitive right now.
Operator: And we can go next to Drew Babin with Baird.
Andrew Babin: Question on the improvement and new lease pricing year-over-year within the legacy Post portfolio. Would you say that this is directly attributable to the ROI CapEx on some of these units you've acquired? And I guess, can you speak to how you're pricing those units relative to new supply in places like Uptown, Dallas, Atlanta and Austin?
Thomas Grimes: Drew, we haven't done enough of that CapEx to really move the number. This is really a direct reflection of where pricing was last year when we were just getting started on the merger and supply was picking up. And our ability to get -- last year, we were really on 2 different pricing systems completely. We were just beginning to push renewals up, and we were adapting to the portfolio. So I would tell you, the uptick is significant in terms of just us learning the portfolio and getting our practices and habits in systems in place. And then sorry, what was the second part of your question, Drew?
Andrew Babin: I guess just there's more of these renovated units come to market maybe in the peak leasing season. I guess, what's the pricing strategy relative to the new supply in these markets? Is there a certain kind of gap relative to where the new supply is delivering as far as the rent goal that you're targeting to sort of your value proposition relative to the benefit from it?
Thomas Grimes: That's what we're so excited about the Post portfolio on is -- Post did a really, really fine job of picking locations that stood the test of time. So essentially, what you've got is we have mid-rise product that was 8 to 10 years old, let's say. And we're being shaded out by high rises that are looking for $3 a foot. So we're able to upgrade the unit, great bones, well-developed property, and we're able to stay even with the upgrade in units $200 to $500 less than new lease pricing. It's a real sweet spot for us.
Andrew Babin: That's really helpful. And lastly, Al, just a question on the balance sheet, unsecured bond pricing right now for 10 years, if you could kind of give maybe the spread economics there, and then whether MAA would consider doing anything with a duration of over 10 years, given kind of a flat yield curve?
Albert Campbell: Yes, Drew, that's a good point. I mean, both the underlying treasury rates, 10-year rates has gone up recently, and the spreads have gone up a little bit in the bond market. But 10-year bond, if we do once a day, it'd probably be around 4.3 to 4.5 range, something like at. But keep in mind, as I mentioned, we've done $300 million of hedges in preparation for some financing this year. So when and if we do a deal this year, we'll be a little bit lower than that, I would say. And so that's -- and what was the second question, second part of that?
Andrew Babin: 30-year.
Albert Campbell: Oh absolutely, no question. And one of the things we've talked about before is we've worked very hard our balance sheet over the last few years. Now we're at a point we've got a lot of public bonds outstanding on liquidity. We think we're ready to go to potentially a 30-year market at some point. And one of the things that we are looking to do to continue to strengthen our balance sheet is push our duration or maturities out. That's a specific target for us over the next few years, Drew. So can't tell you when we would do that. Obviously, we're going to work tactically when the market gives us that opportunity, but we do expect to seek that kind of activity over the next year or two.
Operator: And we can go next to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Omotayo Okusanya: A couple of questions for me. First of all, you are quickly increasing your exposure to the overall Denver market. Just curious how big you expect to get in Denver over the next few years, and why you're kind of exclusively focusing on that market?
Eric Bolton: Well, we've been looking at the Denver market for, frankly, the last several years. We continue to believe that the growth dynamics there are very compelling. I think that there's just a lot of good things associated with -- I think the next 10 years likely that occur in Denver from a job growth perspective and migration and household demand for that market. Some of the West Coast markets continue to become prohibitively expensive to live in. We think that the markets like Denver, Phoenix, continue to find favor with a lot of households and employers as well. As a result of the merger we did with Post, you may recall, they actually had a development project already underway there, and so that really gave us the toehold into the Denver market that we've been working to find for several years. And then as a consequence of now spending more time in the market, we are -- we went out and created an off-market opportunity on the Sync36 acquisition that we looked at. As I mentioned, we also have another site in the Cherry Creek submarket, very compelling and high-end submarket there, just a little bit southeast of downtown that Post had already on balance sheet that we're working on. So we're going to continue to -- and then we've got another site that we're working that we recently have been working for the past year or so sort of tie-up. So it's just a very slow methodical process that we're continuing to work through, both in terms of development as well as acquisition. And we'll be patient as we look to build out our presence in the Denver market, but we very much like the growth dynamics in that market, and continue to feel that it's a good fit for us.
Omotayo Okusanya: So that's helpful. The second question is for Al. Just kind of going back to same-store effect, again, really good quarter holding those costs down. But kind of going forward, I guess, with where your guidance is, could you just talk a little bit kind of category-by-category where you still think you might be able to hold cost down? I know this quarter, in particular, was repairs and maintenance, and even property tax is only up 2.6%. But I'm curious for the rest of the year, how do you see that mix that will keep you within that low guidance range?
Albert Campbell: Yes. I think for the rest of the year, you'll definitely continue to see repair and maintenance be a good performer for us, Tayo. You'll probably see personnel be in line what it is now. Repair and maintenance continues to show favorability, as we're capturing more of the Post opportunity. I think taxes, real estate taxes, will be pretty consistent. It was 2.6 for Q1, but there are some timing of the prior year appeal finalization. So 4% for the full year on that is about the right picture. And then I think we will say marketing expenses will be low, long term, in the lower end of, not negative, but low 0 to 1% kind of range. And so I think those are the key drivers of it, as you look at the back half of the year. The insurance renewal that we have last year is providing a lot of opportunity. In the first half of the year, we do renew in July, July 1 this year. We have an increase projected, so that's a little bit of a wildcard. We feel like our increase that we're having there is correct, but that's yet to be determined.
Operator: And we can go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.
John Pawlowski: Eric, on the capital plan for 2018, I guess what specifically would you need to see to begin ramping dispositions? I understand you've done a lot of capital recycling in the past, but what would we need to change on the ground to pivot this position strategy?
Eric Bolton: Well, I think that, as you alluded to, I mean, we've worked a lot over the last 5 years, both as a consequence of capital recycling and 2 fairly significant M&A events that have really gotten the position of the portfolio more or less where we want it. I think that we've got the balance and the diversification. We shrunk, reduced, if you will, the number of markets that we're in pretty significantly as a consequence of -- we think created a little bit more efficiency in terms of how we were able to operate the portfolio. So I think that it's a long way of saying we sort of like where we are right now. I think the opportunity to then ramp-up recycling of capital by selling more assets really comes back to the opportunity to match or to fund or match -- fund the capital we pull out of those dispositions and into something that is attractive and would offer an improvement, if you will, in our long-term earnings growth rate over what we're selling. And we're having a hard time finding new deployment opportunities right now that are particularly compelling in terms of pricing. And so as a consequence, we think the right thing to do at the moment is to continue to clip the earnings coupons that we have coming out of a lot of the investments that we have today, keep our earnings coverage strong, keep the balance sheet strong, keep the optionality in place. And I think that we're at a point where, obviously, there's just a wall of capital out there that is continuing to chase multi-family real estate. I don't think it will always be this way, but I think that we're going to continue to be patient with the optionality that we have right now. And I think just selling a bunch of assets and using the proceeds in a compelling way right now is not a good environment for that right now. So we're -- and obviously, it's a good time to be a seller, but finding an attractive use of the capital without really creating earnings pressure associated with that is difficult to pull off right now.
John Pawlowski: Yes. But in certain markets, your comments about how competitive the bid is, and you're sitting in the bidding tent for acquisitions, not willing to underwrite the growth on certain deals that people are. So I guess, why not sell the dream to somebody else with comparable assets in your own portfolio? And balance sheet is in good shape, but build a war chest for another day, sell that dream today.
Eric Bolton: Well, we think we've got a pretty big war chest right now. And I think that giving up earnings right now doesn't seem to be particularly compelling for us. We think that the right thing to do right now is continue to enjoy the earnings that we're getting from the portfolio. We've put the organization through a significant amount of earnings dilution over the last 5 years, recycling over -- well over $1 billion of capital from high-yielding to low-yielding assets. Longer-term earnings growth rate is better as a consequence of these new assets. But we put the organization to a significant dilutive event, both in terms of the recycling that we've done through the merger with Colonial, and more recently, through the merger with Post. We have deleveraged the balance sheet massively over the last 5 years. So we've done a lot of dilution, if you will, earnings dilution over the last 5 years in order to position the company, we think, for a better future earnings growth profile, and a lot of that has been accomplished right now. So we don't see a big need to do more of it right now. We think, frankly, the thing for us to do over the next few years is to harvest the earnings out all the stuff that we've done for the last 5 years, and that's really where our focus is.
John Pawlowski: Okay. Last one for me, in terms of submarket supply backdrop, on the margin, you look forward to 2019 and 2020, do you expect supply to start laying on the legacy MAA footprint more than the Post footprint?
Eric Bolton: No, not really. I think that we continue to see that, frankly, what development does get done today. And I think I've seen the reason why this is going to change anytime given the significant rise in construction cost and significant rise in land cost. The only thing it pencils right now is to build a pretty high-end, very high-rent kind of product. It's the only way you can make it work. And so I don't think there's any reason to see that those conditions are going to change in such a fashion that all of a sudden, you're going to see a wave of modest -- more modest fleet price product starting to be built out. I just don't see that happening.
Operator: And we can go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.
Wesley Golladay: I just want to go back to the questions on concession. On average, for the entire year, do you expect concessions to be less of an issue this year? I know you got hit last year, particularly in the fourth quarter, and that really hurt the guidance. But how should we look at the progression of concessions and new lease spread?
Thomas Grimes: Yes, I want to take concessions. Well, new lease rates, I would expect on a net effect base, to continue to build on the pattern that they have for the first 4 months of the year. And then concessions, I would not expect. It really ramped up in the fourth quarter of last year, and we just don't see anything indicating that that's going to happen again this year.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. And I don't know if you have the data handy, but do you have the new lease spread last year in the fourth quarter?
Thomas Grimes: No, I do not have it at my fingertips. We can follow back up with you on that, Wes. But it is a number we're looking forward to comparing to.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I can go ahead and turn it back over to you, Eric, and the team for any additional or closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. And I guess we look forward to seeing everyone in NAREIT in a few weeks, so thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude today's call. Thank you, everyone, for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a great day.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-02-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 01, 2018. I’d like now to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Savanna, and good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Tom Grimes, our COO, and Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday’s earnings release and our ‘34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call this morning. Overall, same-store and FFO performances for the fourth quarter were in line with our expectations. Leasing fundamentals and results reflect higher levels of new supply primarily impacting the higher in price point properties, offsetting some of the supply pressure at our higher price locations has been the steady results captured from our more moderate price properties located mostly in suburban, submarkets in a number of our secondary markets. MAA’s diversified and balanced portfolio strategy is performing, as we would expect at this point in the cycle. As we consider 2018, we believe the year will unfold initially with leasing performance much in line with what we’ve seen over the last couple of quarters, as new supply continues to come online. However, we continue to believe that based on moderating trends for the permitting of new construction, that we are nearing the trough for this cycle, and with continued good job growth we expect to capture improving pricing trends as we enter the peak leasing season. Tom will highlight more details in his comments, and while is of course very early in the year, performance in January is in line with what we expected. January results continued with strong occupancy. In fact, daily occupancy in January across the same-store portfolio was 40 basis points ahead of the same point last year. Importantly, this strong occupancy provides the support needed for positive pricing traction, and we’re encouraged that effective pricing in January across the same-store portfolio was slightly ahead of the growth rate in January of last year. Our long-established strategy built around a goal of optimizing results over the full cycle continues to deliver solid downside protection to MAA’s earnings stream. And with the strengthening of the balance sheet that we’ve accomplished over the past few years, we’re confident not only in the solid support for our various coverage ratios, but importantly we’re also well positioned for any compelling investment opportunities that might emerge over the coming year. We continue to feel that our focus on the strong job growth Sunbelt region offers the best opportunity for capturing the superior full cycle results that we’re after, the continued strengthening of the economy and the growing appeal of the more affordable region and markets where we focus shareholder capital continue to support our strategy for long-term value creation. Our development pipeline also continues to deliver new earnings growth at attractive yields. And while both our development portfolio and lease up properties represent a drag on earnings in 2018 with almost 2,500 units, this pipeline will become increasingly productive in 2019. We have a number of other development opportunities that we're currently underwriting on both existing land sites we own as well as additional new opportunities and we’d expect to see a couple of new projects or so get underway late this year or early 2019. As described in our earnings release during the fourth quarter, we closed on the new acquisition in Nashville in the very appealing West End submarket near Downtown. The transaction is typical of the acquisitions we've made over the past few years namely a property that had previously been under contract, actually in this case, a couple of different times with a seller that was highly motivated and with a very short close window. We were successful in performing for the seller and closing the acquisition the last week of 2017. We have several other opportunities under review, but pricing and competition does still remain very robust. Final steps and activities surrounding the full integration of the MAA and post operating platforms are underway and we expect to be fully consolidated on the same operating systems and platform later this year. We're making significant progress on the redevelopment opportunities within the legacy post portfolio and our team plans to accelerate activity on this opportunity in 2018. We continue to feel very good about each of the variables we've previously discussed that drive the long-term value proposition associated with the post-merger. Before associated with Post merger. Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work and efforts surrounding the integration that has been completed today in merging MAA and Post. You’ve accomplished a lot and great progress has been made. The MAA platform continues to build strength. The long-term value proposition offered by our strategy, the strengthening of our platform and the commitment our team has in generating value for those served by MAA is compelling. We look forward to executing on the growing opportunities in front of us during 2018. That’s all I have in the way of prepared comments, I’ll turn it over to Tom.
Tom Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our operating performance came in as expected. Revenues for the fourth quarter were 1.8% over the prior year with 96.2% average daily occupancy and 1.7% effective rent growth. Expenses increased just 1.3% over the prior year and NOI increased by 2.2%. Looking at revenues, revenue drivers by portfolio in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year, the legacy MAA portfolio generated revenue growth of 2.6% with 96.3% average daily occupancy and effective rent growth of 2.4%. The legacy Post portfolio had slightly negative revenue growth with 95.8% average daily occupancy and flat effective rent growth. The slight improvement in overall year-over-year revenue growth rate from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was a result of the steadily improving occupancy in the legacy Post portfolio. Expenses continue to be a bright spot for both portfolios. While it takes time for the improvements and revenue management practices and pricing to show up in our revenues, our programs to more aggressively manage operating expenses have shown more immediate results. Including real estate taxes which were up 5.7%, overall expenses for the same-store portfolio were up just 1.3% for the quarter. That was driven by improvements in personnel, repair and maintenance as well as property and casualty insurance. We still have room to run with our expense management programs on the post-portfolio and expect continued progress in 2018. Our operating disciplines are now fully in place and at the current run rate, the savings will continue. January results show the benefit of our consolidated platform. Overall same-store average daily occupancy in January is 96.3%, which is 40 basis points higher than the prior year. This is driven by 50-basis points year-over-year improvement in the legacy post portfolio. Overall, same-store January blended lease-over-lease rates are up 1%, which is 10 basis points better than the blended rents in January of last year. Within the legacy post portfolio, blended rents in January up -- were up 0.4% and continue to lag the performance of the legacy MAA portfolio, where blended rents were up 1.3%. Encouragingly however, blended rents within the legacy portfolio in January were up a 130 basis points from the blended rents in January of the prior year. While we are facing higher supply pressures in the post sub-markets, the improvements in our operating practices at the legacy post locations are allowing us to gain ground on year-over-year pricing trends. Looking forward, our renewal trends are solid across the same-store portfolio. January lease renewals were up 5.4% with February and March renewal transactions, thus far capturing 5.3% growth. Supply will continue to pressure our new leases, while the jobs to completion ratio improves from 6% to 1% in 2017 to 7% to 1% in 2018, the benefit is likely to be felt in the back half of the year. Deliveries for 2018 are front loaded with our markets seen 52,000 deliveries in the first quarter, declining each quarter to about half that amount in the fourth quarter. It is important to remember then in 2017 deliveries were lowest in the fourth quarter – in the first quarter and peaked in the fourth quarter set another way. The fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 marked a high point of deliveries in our markets. Job growth is expected to remain robust in our markets at over 2% versus the national average. Permitting is also improving in our markets down 4% versus the same time last year. Dallas and Austin are facing the most pressure. In 2018, we expect 23,000 deliveries for Dallas and in Austin, we expect 7,000 deliveries. We're encouraged that job growth has remained strong in both markets. Dallas job growth was at 2.3% in 2017 and expected to stay at that strong level. Austin job growth was 1.6% in 2017 and this year in 2017 this and expected to grow to 2.1% in 2018. While elevated supply levels moderated rent growth, we're seeing good results – a good rent growth in many markets. Fort Worth, Raleigh, Phoenix and Richmond stood out for the group. Renter demand remained steady and move outs by our current residents continue to remain low. Move outs for overall same-store portfolio were down 6% for the quarter. Move outs to home buying and move outs to home renting were down 10% down 10% and 9% respectively. On a 12 -- on a rolling 12-month basis, turnover dropped to 50.1%. As you know the majority of the legacy post locations are in inner loop areas that are seeing the most supply, while this new supply puts pressure on the newer product it creates opportunity on the older product in these excellent locations. There are 13,000 legacy post units that have compelling redevelopment opportunities. We can make these great locations more competitive by updating the product. We have room to raise the rents and still be well below the rates of the new product coming online. Momentum is building on the redevelopment program across the legacy post portfolio. Through 2017, we have completed 1,700 units. On average, we’re spending $8,600 in getting a rent increase that’s 12% more than a comparable non-redeveloped unit. For the total portfolio during 2017, we completed over 8,300 interior unit upgrades. On Legacy MAA portfolio, we continue to have a robust redevelopment pipeline of 10,000 to 15,000 units. On a combined basis, with the legacy post portfolio, our total redevelopment pipeline now stands in the neighborhood of 25,000 units. As you can tell from that release, our active lease-up communities are performing well. Leasing has gone better than expected at Charlotte, in Midtown and Nashville and it stabilized in the fourth quarter ahead of our original schedule. We are actively leasing Post at Afton Oaks in Houston which will stabilize on schedule this quarter. Our remaining pipeline of lease-up properties at Denton II, Post South Lamar II, Post Midtown and Post River North, and Alcon West End and are all on track to stabilize on schedule. 2017 was a year of significant change for our organization. We started 2017 with two completely different operating platforms and teams. We are pleased the bulk of the integration work of the post-portfolio is now behind us. We are starting 2018 with a much more aligned and cohesive operating platform and team. We are looking forward to continuing to capture value creation opportunities on both the revenue and expense sides of the equation as we finalize full integration activities in 2018. Al?
Al Campbell: Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. I'm up for some additional commentary on the company's fourth quarter and full your earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally on initial guidance for 2018. Net income available for common shareholders was a $1.08 per diluted common share for the quarter. FFO for the quarter was a $1.50 per share. Fourth quarter performance includes $0.03 per share as of a non-cash income from the valuation of the embedded derivative related to the per shares issued in the post-merger, and excluding the impact of this embedded derivative earnings results for the fourth quarter were essentially in line with our expectations. Net income available for common shareholders was $2.86 per share for the full year of 2017. FFO for the full year was $5.94 per share, which includes $0.07 of non-cash income related to the per share valuation offset by a $0.17 per share of merger and integration calls during the year. AFFO for the full year was $5.30 per share, which is for the healthy 66% payout – dividend payout ratio well below the sector average. During the fourth quarter, we acquired one community for $72 million and sold two communities for $97 million and in gross proceeds completing our capital recycling plans for the full year. Total book gains of $68 million were recognized related to these dispositions during the fourth quarter. For the full year, we acquired two communities for a combined total investment of $134 million and sold five communities for combined gross proceeds of a $186 million, which produced an average 15% leveraged IRR for this position portfolio. These sales also produced $127 million recorded book gains and a $132 million of combined tax gains for the year, which were deferred with 1031(b) transactions were covered with other tax planning methods, eliminating any special dividend requirement for the year. During the fourth quarter, we completed two development communities on plan. Both were expansions on – up current communities located in Austin and Kansas City, which are now included in our lease-up portfolio. During the quarter, we also funded $28 million of additional development costs, bringing total development funding for the year to $170 million. Our development pipeline at year-end now contains three communities with the total estimated cost of $214 million, which only $46 million remains to be funded at year-end. We expect NOI yields to average 6.3% on these development communities, when it's completed and stabilized. Our lease-up portfolio now contains five communities, totaling 1,538 units, including the community acquired in lease-up during the fourth quarter with average occupancy for the group of 62.5% at quarter end. We expect to stabilize one of the communities in the first quarter of 2018, three during the second half of the year, and the final community early next year. Our balance sheet remains in great shape at year-end during the fourth quarter. We paid off $130 million of secured debt as well as $80 million of maturing unsecured notes with our line of credit. And at quarter end our leverage as defined by our bond coverage was only 3.32%, while our net debt was just over five times recurring EBITDA. At quarter end, 83% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates with well out of maturities averaging 4.7 years. We also had almost $600 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility. Finally, we are providing initial earnings guidance for 2018 with the release, detailed in our supplemental information package. We’re providing guidance for net income for diluted common share, which is reconciled the FFO and AFFO in the supplement. We're also providing AFFO in the supplement. We’re also providing guidance and other key business metrics expected to drive performance for 2018, a number of which were outlined in our recent Investor Day presentation provided at NAREIT. Net income per diluted common share is projected to be $1.78 to $2.08 for the full year 2018, and FFO is projected to be $5.85 to $6.15 per share or $6 per share at the midpoint, which includes $0.08 per share of final merger and the integration costs related to the post-merger. AFFO was projected to be $5.24 to $5.54 per share or $5.39 at the midpoint. The primary driver of 2018 performance is same-store NOI growth which is projected to be 2% to 2.5% for the full year based on 1.75% to 2.25% revenue growth and 1.5% to 2.5% operating expense growth. Our revenue projections include continued strong occupancy levels through 2018, ranging 95.75% to 96.25%, combined with projected average blended rental pricing on new leases and renewals in the 2.75% range for the full year. We expect revenue performance to begin the year near the bottom of the range and improve over the course of the year as we expect supply pressure to moderate. We generally expect modest growth in operating expenses for 2018 with real estate taxes continuing to the only area expected pressure and well below the price level growth, real estate taxes are expected to increase 3.5% to 4.5% range for the year. We project acquisition volume to range between $300 million and $350 million for the full year including several lease-up deals. And given the significant recycling of assets over the last several years, we aren’t currently planning for any dispositions in 2018. We expect to end 2018 with our leverage around 34% on a net debt to gross assets basis well within our long-term range. Also, another important consideration for 2018 is our projected average effective interest rate range of 3.8% to 4% which is about 45 basis points to 50 basis points above the prior year at midpoint, which represents about $0.18 per share impact to our earnings. Nearly, half of this projected increase is impact of rising short-term interest rates on our value rate debt, based on three interest rate increasing by the Fed over the course of 2017, in our projection of three more during 2018. Declining interest capitalization, as we complete the construction of our development pipeline, produces another portion of the increase about a quarter, with declining mark-to-market adjustment related to the debt acquired from the Colonial and Post mergers producing the remaining portion of an increase for 2019. Our guidance also assumes to incur final integration costs to $8 million to $10 million, as we complete our systems integrations related to the recent Post merger. And that our totally gross overhead costs, which is a G&A and property management expenses combined will range between $89.5 million to $92.5 million, fully reflecting our planned $20 million of overhead synergies, as compared to the combined standalone company calls projected for 2018. Although we expect continued volatility related to the valuation of the preferred shares and acquired with the post-merger, our projections do not include any valuation adjustments as these adjustments are both non-cash and real impractical to accurately predict. So that’s all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Savannah, we will now turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Eric 2017 was disappointing with the same-store revenue guidance cuts in and ultimate nets, and so when you went through the guidance and budget process this year, do they’ve been changed and what were the lessons learned from 2017?
Eric Bolton: Well, you know, Nick what I would tell you is that as we started last year in 2017, we knew that supply levels were going to be picking up. And they did pick up, as Tom alluded to, peaking in the fourth quarter of 2017. I think the thing that surprised us a little bit was that we thought that it would peak frankly a little bit earlier in the year and the delays that took place worked against us a little bit. And then, as the delays occurred and more of this lease-up activity was pushed into the fourth quarter, which as you know, a very slow period of time for leasing. The concession activity proved to be much more aggressive as a consequence of that. And so, market conditions were more negatively impacted particularly on the pricing angle as a consequence of some of those delays and the seasonality factor that I alluded to. And so, I think as we think about 2018, we're encouraged as Tom pointed out that there's pretty clear evidence that the supply trends are going to moderate based on the fact that Q1 of this year we're in right now is by far the highest and by the time we get into the year it's half. So, the question becomes are you going to have more delays? We think there could be more delays, but we're still optimistic that in terms of delays and delivery, but we're still optimistic that as we get to the summer season which is really as you know the peak time for rent growth that we are going to see more moderate pricing or more moderate pressure from the new supply than we did last year. And so, I think that though this is all predicated of course on the assumption that job growth continues to hold up. And we think that that’s an assumption, that’s a pretty safe bet on the markets that we are in and industries in the country. So, I give that perspective just in terms of sort of market fundamentals, the supply dynamics and the differences between 2017 and 2018. But the other thing that I think is important to appreciate is the big difference between 2017 and 2018 is that this time last year literally we had just closed the Post transaction. And we were facing you know a year of essentially operating on two completely different systems and platforms. I think it’s, particularly as it relates to the Post portfolio, it’s important to appreciate the fact that we were dealing also with a tremendous amount of on-site personnel transitions that were taking place. There was over the course of the first three months last year, we essentially saw a transition of well over half of the managers on-site in the Legacy Post portfolio. So, that activity if you will it’s hard to put a number on it, but it certainly played into some of the challenges for 2017. The good news is as we start in 2018, we’re in a very solid position. Our teams are set. We’ve got -- while we’ve got a little bit more systems integration work left to complete, we are much more aligned in terms of approach and practices than we’ve ever been. So, I think as we start this year, we’re feeling much, much more secure in terms of where we are, in terms of market fundamentals certainly in a much more comfortable position from an execution perspective. And you know that’s a long answer to your question there, but that’s how we kind of look at that's a long answer to your question, but that's how we kind of look at it.
Nick Joseph: No, I appreciate it. But given the elevated supply and I guess the risk of further delays, I mean, what gives you the confidence to increase the rent growth assumptions from what you've laid out in November? It feels like if anything after last year you'd rather be a little conservative to start off the year.
Eric Bolton: Well, a couple of things; one is the fact that we're starting in such a strong occupancy position, actually slightly higher than last year our exposure which is a combination of our vacancy plus our 60 day move out notices that we have is lower. And so that obviously solid occupancy is important to getting the pricing traction and we're in a better position now than we were this time last year. Having said that, the other thing that we're comforted by is, we have the revenue management platform if you will fully implemented under sort of the practices and approach that we take across the legacy post portfolio. And so, with that system in place, the stability and staffing I mentioned that – and the strong occupancy that puts us in a position. Now, having said all that Nick, let me -- I'm just being honest about it as we get into the busy season, we'll see how things play out. There's certainly no guarantee that -- I can't, I mean we're assuming that the job growth in demand side will be there. There's really no reason to believe it won't be. We -- I’d certainly think there's probably likely to be some delays take place, but we think that in terms of new delivery and some of it may bleed over into the summer. But having said that, having a little bit more leasing, our supply issues in the summer when leasing activity is elevated is a much better time to have it than in the winter as I talked about is what we saw in the fourth quarter and a little bit in this first quarter. So, there is a lot of influences here, a lot of factors, but we think that work – we feel good that the overall expectation that rent growth improves over the course of this year, particularly as we get into the busy season into the back half of this year is a reasonable assumption to make.
Nick Joseph: Thanks for all the color.
Eric Bolton: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Drew Babin: Good morning.
Eric Bolton: Good morning, Drew.
Drew Babin: Question on same property NOI emergence, I'm looking at 2017 over 2016, it looks like the blended portfolio margins increased about 20 basis points and if you – kind of midpoint of the guidance for 2018, it looks like maybe in the best case it’s another 20 basis points or so. Are margins approximately where you envisioned them being at this point with the post-merger? And I guess if you include property management expenses in the calculation, would the margins look quite a bit better than what I just described?
Al Campbell: Let me start with that, Drew. This is Al. I think no, I think they’re not where they are that we think they will be ultimately. I think what we expect and we have outlined in our forecast for 2018 some continued capture of expense performance, we are 2% of the midpoint of our guidance there with taxes, so going up 4% at midpoint. So, there is certainly some continued benefit from that, but we think there is more to go, maybe little bit more expenses, but really more on revenue through the redevelopment pipeline as we talked about it will take a couple of years. We’ve got – as Tom talked about, we got 13,000 units of inventory there. So, it will take two years, three years to really work through that. So that will be a meaningful impact. And so, I think there are other things in revenue that we’ll see more as markets improve and we really put more that on the tables, I see. So that’s not – so we don’t expect that we're at where we're going to be ultimately with those margins, they will improve really more as you move into 2019.
Drew Babin: Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly on the external growth environment, it seems like the market remains very tight for new opportunities. I guess, it’d be helpful, if you talk about the state-wide field expectations on your four-queue acquisition? And then I guess a broader question you know I guess kind of what's the trade-off between the benefits of potentially in A minus credit rating and the interest savings that might result from that vis-à-vis up taking your leverage a little bit should some acquisition opportunities that make sense come down the pipe. What are the internal conversations around that been like?
Eric Bolton: Well. I'll talk a little bit about the environment – transaction environment and the deal in the fourth quarter. And Al can talk about the balance sheet. I you know, I'll tell you Drew, I mean you know we are seeing more transacting – transaction activity at this point than we did this time last year. We've got quite a few deals under review at this point. We have you know our guidance of $300 million to $350 million. I mean I can tell you, I mean it’s certainly no guarantee it’ll close, it's in due diligence. But we have you know contracts on deals that probably get us to about a third of that of that way already. So, we are seeing more activity. And I'm optimistic that this year is going to yield a little bit more you know better buying opportunities than what we've seen. And answer to your other question, generally, I can tell you that you know between the disposition proceeds, we generated last year we carried into this year between the free cash flow that we’re generating as you know and in our assumptions, we’re not assuming any equity issue this year. We haven’t been in the equity markets in quite some time and so see no expectation to do that. So, if we execute the plan that we have laid out, our leverage will move up just a tad as a consequence to that, if the acquisition environment is even better than we expect and the volume is higher than we have forecast and we’re successful in that regard, then will have to have that conversation about the metrics on the balance sheet. Our coverage ratio, coverage ratios are very, very strong, better – payout ratio is better than the sector average. So, we’ve got a fair amount of room to execute some external growth without worrying about any additional capital and without worrying about any sort of pressures on our current ratings. We like the flexibility we have right now and I think that that pretty well defines – we think we’re in a good spot right now and any notion that we need to work to take our rating up another notch is not something we’re actively thinking about right now.
Drew Babin: That’s very helpful. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Rich Anderson: Thanks. Good morning team. So, if I can just carry on with that conversation real quickly. So, the acquisition pipeline then becomes a bit more accretive, I would assume since you’re going to find it – funded with debt and free cash flow instead of dispositions going forward. So, that’s good. Can you quantify how accretive $300 million of acquisitions that’s good. Can you quantify how accretive $300 million of acquisitions might be for a full year or is that not successful?
Eric Bolton: Well, I’d say it gets a little bit difficult only in the sense that we don't know at this point how leased up if you will those particular assets will be I mean…
Rich Anderson: Okay.
Eric Bolton: On a fully stabilized basis, it becomes pretty accretive, but where we're finding our best place right now are some of the deals that are not quite stabilized, so it gets a little bit more difficult to pull that.
Rich Anderson: Understood. Okay. And then Tom, you mentioned, I think you said 52,000 units of deliveries in the first quarter in your markets, is that right?
Eric Bolton: That's correct.
Rich Anderson: So, if you were to sort of aggregate the whole year, I know it's trending down, but is it about – is it over 100,000 units of deliveries, if you were to look at the entirety of the year?
Eric Bolton: Yeah. So, it’s a 154,000 deliveries, down about 4% from 2017.
Rich Anderson: Okay. 154,000. And if you would kind of look at the national picture, I don't know if 350,000 units or something like that is about right in your mind, but so you're accounting for newer markets about a third of the supply in the United States, is that kind of in the ballpark out of 25 or 30 markets that you guys traffic in?
Eric Bolton: Oh, that sounds reasonable, Rich. I'm not looking at the overall number, but that sounds appropriate.
Rich Anderson: Okay. And I guess, the question – excuse me, for the siren in the background. The question is, what has been the history? Maybe, this is a bigger broader question for Eric. What has been the history of the Sunbelt world in terms of the total national supply picture? Is a third kind of been the number for a long time, is it been higher or lower than that and where do you see it going?
Eric Bolton: I think historically it's been the Southeast Sunbelt markets. If you look at percentages in the one of the lines we’re talking about, I would tell you long-term historically has been higher.
Rich Anderson: Okay.
Eric Bolton: I think that we've – we've sort of been in a different paradigm in the last two years to three years and with some of the more overbuilt markets being some of the markets that five, six, seven years ago, we used to think we're a high barrier. And so, I think the dynamic, that paradigm has changed a good bit, and as a consequence of that, I think I would argue that a lot of these -- there are no more high barrier markets in a way. I think supply can happen anywhere. And I think that from our perspective, we've always dealt with supply, worry, supply, risk, and thus ultimately, I believe the best way to capture the performance that we're looking for over a long period of time, is just be deployed in front of demand and we pay more attention to the demand side of the equation, we give the supply side of the equation, its due respect through active diversification and balance in various sub markets and price points, but at least that's how we think about it.
Rich Anderson: Great color. Thanks, guys.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Rich.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi. Good morning. I was just curious, if you could talk a little bit about the specific markets that you're most optimistic about and would expect to be towards the higher end of guidance or above that range? And then any markets that you're concerned that, that could be negative this year from a revenue growth perspective?
Eric Bolton: Sure, Austin. The three that, jump out on the positive side or Jacksonville, Florida, Orlando, and Phoenix, all three of those have some level of supply but great job growth, and jobs to completions ratios are in line and doing pretty well. So, those are -- those we would expect sort of to lead. On the concerning side, I would tell you Austin and Dallas are the ones that we have the most concern about. Austin actually sees supply go down a little bit next year, but it's still relatively higher rate at 3% of inventory and in Dallas will – it goes up slightly on supply. And those are the two that we are probably most engaged on.
Austin Wurschmidt: Do you expect Austin or Dallas to produce negative revenue growth in 2018?
Eric Bolton: I think that is positive -- possible, but it would be closer to flat where it's been now.
Austin Wurschmidt: No, that's helpful. Thanks. And then I'm just curious how you're expecting the trend in new and renewal lease rates throughout the year? You've maintained a fairly wide spread between new and renewal lease rate growth. So, what's kind of the expectation moving forward?
Eric Bolton: Austin, I can tell you what is kind of built in the forecasts, and Tom maybe can add some color there. But what we would expect in general it's in our pricing guidance is in our revenue guidance is for renewals to continue essentially as they did in 2017, they were in the 5% to 6% range here, and they will continue strong performance there. And the new pricing would be the area that we would see the improvement that would take our pricing to two in a quarter two and three quarters to 2.5 at the midpoint. And I would say probably a larger percentage that would come from the Post side of portfolio as there's opportunity for improvement in that this year as we move into the year and we see supply wane as we're talking about our expectations on the back half of the year, but Tom would have some more color...
Tom Grimes: Yeah. No, I just echo Al’s comments, we would – we’ve seen renewal rates stay steady in the 5%, 5.5% range, expect that to continue where you’ll see -- the gap, if you will, is absolutely widest this time here, it will close as we go into the busier summer season and demand picks up and then we should also as that backend supply outlines that also gives us an opportunity on new leases as well.
Austin Wurschmidt: Fair enough. But you wouldn’t expect new leases to close a significant gap based on the $2.25 to $2.75 that you’ve kind of assumed for blended lease rate pricing, is that fair?
Eric Bolton: That is fair.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. And then lastly, just getting one question on the funding side. Are you assuming acquisitions are funded on the line or any capital, anything on the debt side that you’re assuming from an issuance perspective?
Eric Bolton: Yeah. It’s a great question, Austin. We definitely – we have a $1 billion credit facility, $600 million right now, we definitely, in the short-term, plan to fund activity on the line and as the year progresses, we’ll have – we have planned bond activity to take that lying down. We’d like to keep that below half bar at any given time, so that tells you that we’ll play a bond deal probably early in the mid-part of the year and then as we move into the year, we’ll look at what’s on our line and make a decision at that time as well. So, we do have some planned bond activity in the year to knock that line down. And I would take you into the market there, you’re probably somewhere – we would probably focus on 10-year and for modeling perspective, I put in probably 4% something that maybe just south of that.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. That’s helpful. Thanks, Al.
Operator: And we can go next to Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Conor Wagner: Thank you. Good morning.
Eric Bolton: Good morning.
Conor Wagner: Tom, could you give us a little color on what you’re seeing in Houston and D.C.? And then, you guys have solutions for those markets this year?
Tom Grimes: Sure. To start with Houston, Houston, that was a market that inner loop, we were seeing pretty consistently two months free suburban one month free, let's call it, a late second quarter, early third quarter, and it's tightened up significantly. Occupancies continue to stay strong. Suburban, we are not offering concessions, inner loop, we have all of our assets stabilized there now, so we don't have anything in lease-up. We are noticing that some of the lease ups might equal – might offer a month free in specific places and depending on sort of our exposure and fore plan and proximity that we might match it. But across the board, it is – it's pretty reasonable. And so, moving on to D.C., I think job growth is I would say in the acceptable range. I think what we're mostly optimistic about in D.C. is sort of execution opportunity, we've got a good team up there, but a lot of redevelopment opportunity, continued low hanging fruit, just as they learn the expense programs are doing a really fine job on that. And I think we're encouraged by D.C. The fundamentals aren’t there for it to perform like Orlando or Jackson or Phoenix, but it may perform a little better than expected.
Conor Wagner: Great. Thank you.
Eric Bolton: Thank you.
Operator: And we can go next to Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Trent Trujillo: Hi. Good morning. This is Trent Trujillo here on for Nick. So, you touched on Dallas early in the call. I was just curious both looking at Atlanta and Dallas are two of your largest market and both are expected to see heightened supply in 2018, so if you could possibly provide a framework on how you’re looking at these two markets in terms of fundamentals and operational expectations and trends throughout the year, that would be appreciated.
Eric Bolton: Yeah. Sure, Nick. As far as deliveries on Dallas, it will peak like everything else on deliveries in the first quarter. But the supply falls off at a less dramatic rate, let's say, than the overall portfolio. We're seeing some encouraging signs in January there, whereas you know most of Dallas was at four to eight weeks. [Audio Gap] areas are going to be something that we wrestle with most of the year. Moving on to Atlanta, most of that supply is focused sort of in that Peachtree Road Corridor running from North Avenue in Peachtree, sort of Midtown area, up through Brookwood to Buckhead and Brookhaven. But they are currently short term on Atlanta, concessions are doing a little bit better. And we've seen a half a month to a month there, that spread in Atlanta follows more the company spread in terms of how deliveries are being brought to the market. And then the suburban Atlanta stuff is pretty solid.
Trent Trujillo: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. Just one quick additional question. On expenses, it looks like real estate tax growth by itself pretty much gets the low end of the range. So how are you thinking about the other components of OpEx?
Eric Bolton: Pretty much all the other components are in modest growth. We haven't -- we have -- expecting significant pressure near the areas, personnel marketing, and other areas of modest growth. So, taxes is the really only area, the midpoint of the entire guidance combined is 2% only area that 4% of midpoint puts a little pressure. Remember that’s a third of the – little bit a third of your total expense.
Al Campbell: And Austin, our R&M cost, which our total maintenance expense cost, which I would consider maintenance personnel plus all expenses related to maintenance. On the Post portfolio, we've improved it by 10% to 15%. They're still running about 20% higher than MAA for the year, and we've – we’ll have continued improvement there as they continue to refine their practices, they're doing a good job. We like where the run rate is right now, and that alone is going to provide some relief to the tax number.
Eric Bolton: Obviously, there's some negative numbers on those other line items too.
Al Campbell: I said another way, to make the math work.
Eric Bolton: Exactly.
Trent Trujillo: Okay. Sure. I appreciate the color. Thank you very much for taking the questions.
Operator: And we can go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Kim: Thanks. Good morning. Your average effective rent per unit of $1,170 per month, increased year-over-year, but it declined sequentially. I realize some of this is due to seasonality, but I was wondering if that sequential decline came as a surprise to you?
Eric Bolton: No, I mean John just real quick. I mean you know the math as well as I do, you come in with a certain ARU and then you re-price with concessions in the fourth quarter, it pulls it down. I don't think that's that out of phenomenon for us.
John Kim: So, just to clarify that the same-store revenue guidance that you have for this year of 2% that will translate pretty much directly to 2% average rent growth? I’m just wondering if there is any other property income or other items that may change…
Eric Bolton: We would expect property income to grow roughly in line with that revenue. So, we expect it to not have a material impact up or down, so that pricing should be the pricing, the carrying in plus the pricing we’re getting for 2018 blended should be the primary drivers of revenues.
Al Campbell: Yeah. Our effective rent growth is expected to be right around that 2% number.
John Kim: Okay. And concessions, do you think they will be peaked or they will peak in the first quarter in line with the supply delivery peak?
Eric Bolton: That is what we would expect.
John Kim: Okay. And then a question on your secondary market performance that's been stronger than your primary market in the last couple of quarters, it sounds like you're not necessarily focused on acquiring in these markets, but I just wanted to clarify this to get your thoughts on that?
Eric Bolton: I would tell you John that we are focused on those markets for additional growth. We continue to like a number of those smaller markets or there are some that we wouldn't expand in. But there's quite a few of them that we would and what we have found is frankly, the environment, the competitive environment for deploying capital as it has been every bit is aggressive in markets like Charleston and Savannah, in Greenville South Carolina as it has been in some of the larger markets like Atlanta and Dallas. But no, we absolutely are committed to continuing to maintain the broad portfolio profile that we have today.
John Kim: And is that where you're seeing some of the time sensitive sellers?
Eric Bolton: No, it can happen anywhere. The two properties that we acquired last year happened to both be in Nashville and both had that sensitivity associated with it. But we can run into that kind of scenario frankly anywhere.
John Kim: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Dennis McGill with Zelmand and Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dennis McGill: Hi. Thank you, guys. Good morning. First question continuing on that – the latest acquisition in Nashville, but the supplemental has that built in 2015. So, I just wanted you to clarify sort of the timing of that, I don't know if that's maybe the start, but just maybe in the lifecycle of that. And then any additional color you have on how that came about whether that was brought to you or you’re seeking these out more on year-over-year terms?
Eric Bolton: Well, I think that it probably commenced construction at that 2015 timeframe not because frankly it's not stabilized yet. What happened with that particular deal, it was part of the Port City sort of scenario that's unfolding and we heard about the deal early last year, it came to market, we toured it. We didn't really – we underwrote it, and didn't really get involved in the process. It went on the contract at roughly 10% more than we had underwrote the deal. Then it went under – fell out of contract went under contract with another – and this happened in July went under contract again sometime in September, October timeframe with another potential buyer at a price point that was still 5% higher than what we felt was a good price. And so, it then subsequently fell out, and they called us in late November, early December highly motivated to get it done and get it done by year end and that’s what we did.
Dennis McGill: Okay. I mean, that’s helpful. Second question, just as it relates to overall supply. I think you talk to sort of the delivery pipeline slowing at the end of this year and what we've seen in a lot of the projections of the national numbers is that the delay in supply being pushed out is also being complemented by more supply being found. So, it's not a zero-sum game as far as timing goes. How do you get your arms around just the piece of supply that's call it chad or whatever you'd like to call it that just isn't in those numbers, it tends to get found over time? How do you get confident that that's fully captured in the numbers?
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean, in thinking about putting our forecast together, I mean, first of all, we actually see supply delivery peaking in the first quarter of this year, it's actually slightly higher first quarter this year than it was in the fourth quarter of last year and some of that is the slippage that we've talked about previously. But I think as we think about looking at supply pressure, I mean, we kind of go at it both from a top-down and a bottom-up approach. And you know we look at a lot of the same forecast for supply that everyone else looks at in market studies and other things that we have access to build up our expectations at a portfolio level. But then of course, we in putting together our property budgets, I mean, we know what's happening in the neighborhoods every property manager, I can promise she knows what new property is likely to come online in 2018 and we have that dialed into our expectations to some level on. And so, there’s no if you will at a high-level, I think it’s always possible to have a project or two or more not make – not get into the data, but at the property manager level, I can promise you, they know what is under construction within any kind of proximity to their property.
Dennis McGill: That's helpful. And then, just lastly on the post transaction, you get a full year now under your belt. How would that year compared to the underwriting that was done during due diligence at the time of the pricing and any positives or negatives that you call out relative to the initial expectations?
Eric Bolton: Well, I would tell you that the supply pressure and the performance in 2017 out of the legacy post portfolio was weaker than we would have expected. No question about it. But obviously, we did not execute this merger with a goal towards maximizing opportunity of value in 2017. It's a much longer horizon associated with it. Having said that, if you go back and look at some of our prior presentations, you’ll see the merger value proposition atomized out in pretty definitive detail, and you'll notice that in most cases almost every case, those various line items that derive that we think is going to drive value out of this transaction are expected to become increasingly evident in 2018 and 2019 and some of even beyond 2019. So, the only things that I can point to right, rather that we know that we've captured some immediate value on is on the financing side and on the balance sheet side, we got immediately upgraded by the agencies when we announced the deal. The other thing I would tell you that has been faster than we expected as Tom alluded to some of the operating expense efficiencies that we've captured some of those things happened faster in 2017 than we expected, so we got better performance on that side of the equation. And as Tom alluded to, we got more to go. The redevelopment opportunity, out of the merger frankly, the redevelopment opportunity within the post assets was actually bigger than we thought it was going to be. And if you look at the sort of the outlook on the value proposition such as redevelopment that we published, it’s the time of the merger announcement versus where we were rather and you’ll see that opportunity has grown. So, net-net, over the next three or four years, I mean the value proposition from this merger is very much intact. And frankly, a little bit bigger than we thought it was going to be, it’s just little slower coming online than perhaps, we would have thought as a consequence of some of the supply pressure that has come online this year, peaking, we think early this year and but we still feel very, very good about, about the transaction.
Dennis McGill: The thing about it from a cash flow standpoint year one would have been slightly below or below where you underwrote, but the overall cash flow stream would have been higher…
Eric Bolton: Correct.
Dennis McGill: Or would stand higher today.
Eric Bolton: Correct.
Dennis McGill: Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Al, just you have answered the same-store expense question I guess a couple of different ways. But another way to look at it is, the – so at the 2% midpoint, how much higher would that be without the expense savings out of post that you’re recognizing in there?
Al Campbell: Rob, it’s hard to -- I haven’t got that math in front of me, but I would, I would -- somewhere in the range of 50 basis points to 75 basis points kind of range and just let me give a little more color on some of the performance. I probably didn’t do a good job on the first question, but yeah, there are some items that we are getting some, continue get some negatives. If you look at 2% performance with continued 4% on real estate taxes with, which is just over 30-year portfolio, still stronger performance, up above 1.8% year in 2017. And so, we’re definitely continuing to get some synergies from R&M and some other areas maybe -- and one area is insurance I should bring in. We are -- our renewal is July 1. We had a very good renewal in 2017, had a reduction in expenses and we expect that we project in this year's renewal in 2018 to have an increase, but the net effect for the year is still reduction. So, all those things together bring us to that 2% and I think probably without some of the things we’ve talked about 50 basis points maybe 75 basis points higher.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And does that – then that includes the changes that you guys have made at Post on the personnel side that savings?
Al Campbell: Yes.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. So, I mean, another way to think about it I guess is, are you guys seeing upward pressure within the core Mid-America portfolio on wages at the property level, but sort of saving it by reducing headcount at the Post properties, is that accurate?
Al Campbell: No. No. I mean – frankly both portfolios have been in pretty good shape on the – on that line item and our folks have been thoughtful about how they spend their dollars on site and the – the Post portfolio has made it better, it’s not covering up a weakness in the Mid-America side.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. So, you're not really seeing any material increase in wages at the property level like some of your – some of your peers are talking about 5% increases in wages at the property level, which obviously is another big component of the same store expense load?
Al Campbell: Our forecast includes and we have plans in place 2.5%, 3% range for that.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Perfect. And then Eric, how’s the board thinking about I mean read to that a tough whatever you want to call it three months, six months, nine months, 12 months here, the stock is after sort of peaking up around 110 is now another bad day, tomorrow could push you guys under 90. How do you -- how does the board sort of thinking about you know share repurchases and possibly selling additional assets. You don’t have any dispositions in your guidance as of yet, but if the stock continues to get weak or weaker, you know is that plausible alternative for you guys or is that still not enough of a discount to utilize capital for that?
Eric Bolton: No, we very much think about it, Rob. And you know obviously at some level of discount to value that becomes a compelling use of capital, compelling in the sense that it’s more compelling than any other alternative that might be presenting itself, whether that be acquiring other properties or starting new developments. So, we’re very aware of the math, certainly understand the concept. We’ve bought shares back in our history. We have an active program up right now fully authorized. And so, it’s something that we will continue to monitor, but business becomes what’s the best use of proceeds. And of course, with us now at a point of generating you know close to $100 million – around a $100 million of free cash flow, you know it becomes something that we certainly think about.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Rob.
Operator: And we can go next to John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead, your line is open. John Guinee, your line is open. Please check your mute function. All right. We can go next to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Tayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Just two questions for me. The first one is focused on post properties. Again, you guys closed the merger in December last year, so we're well over a year into this. I do understand and see the merger related expenses dropping in 2018 versus 2017, but still curious about the $8 million or so you expect to spend in 2018 by exactly what does that comprise of?
Al Campbell: Tayo, this is Albert. That is the final portions of integrating our systems and putting our two systems platform together. I think we talked about a bit in our Investor Day that – that our people and our platforms and our policies and practices have been fully aligned and in great shape. Really 2017, as we get to the middle part to 2017 what we did with our systems we had two platforms we’re operating. We allowed them to stay apart during the busy season of 2017 really to go ahead and jump on some of the synergies and get our people in our processes gathering. So that causes virtually all related to the finalizing the systems platform, it will be rolling, we've got all the planning, all the designing, all the testing, and all of that stuff is done, and we're rolling that new system combined platform out through the middle half of this year. And so, the majority of that costs will fall of $8 million to $10 million in the first two quarters, maybe a little bit trailing in the back part of you, but that's what that is virtually all related to and how you see it fall for the year.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay. And if that spend pretty even throughout the year, is that kind of very first half we did and then any kind of sales off?
Al Campbell: Very first half weighted and telling off in the third and fourth quarters.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay. That's helpful. Then the second question, I had was around expenses. Your GNE combined with your property management expense, roughly about $86 million in 2017, but in 2018, it is projected to increase to $91 million and that also includes all the expected synergies from the Post transaction. So, I’m kind of wondering you've got the synergies, but yet that number is still going up year-over-year?
Al Campbell: Yeah. I think a big part of that is as the capitalized cost overhead for our development, and that's why we kind of in our supplemental data in the guidance we laid out a gross and a net title to help with that. So, bottom line when you're looking at the – P&L and you put those two G&A and overhead together for 2017 and compare that to our guidance of the net number in 2018, it's about a 6%, 6.5% growth, $2.5 million or so of development overhead is or less is being capitalized in 2018, because we finished the large part of that portfolio. So, if we take that out it's about a 4% growth which is in line or below the sector average of overhead growth for many years. But the main point I want to make is if you really the reason we put gross in it is because really the number that we are focused on is gross, which is a cash flow for this company that produces the value. And so, we laid out a plan with the merger to capture $20 million in savings of the two companies standalone, their overhead numbers projected for 2018 to say $20 million off that number. And so, that gross line that we've established in our guidance there does that – fully does that. And so that's the target we've been focused on, and we feel good about that number, we’ve laid out for 2018.
Tayo Okusanya: So, let me just make so -- I get this. So, the gross number which is – yeah, the gross number the midpoint of the gross number is about $91 million, total overhead gross of capitalized development overhead is about $91 million.
Al Campbell: Correct.
Eric Bolton: But again in 2017, that number was $86 million.
Al Campbell: No, no, no, what you’re going to see here that the earnings statement is that net number. So, the midpoint of what you should expect on your modeling on G&A and overhead combined for 2018 is that is the midpoint of that net number. just below that 87.75 and 90.75 tie them.
Tayo Okusanya: Got you. Okay, okay. And that’s the 4% year-over-year increase you were talking about versus 2017, and both years 2017 and 2018 are inclusive of $20 million of synergy?
Al Campbell: 2018 is inclusive of $20 million, 2017 is -- yeah, most of it was in 2017. But 2018 is fully inclusive of it.
Tayo Okusanya: There’s still something I’m not following but I'll take this offline...
Eric Bolton: Let’s, why don’t we take this offline after the call. Tayo we’ll get with you, and get and work through the math.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay. Thank you.
Eric Bolton: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Lewis: Great thanks. I wanted to circle all the way back to the very first question you answered about the same-store revenue guidance. So, you did 1.8% in 4Q, 2.1% for the year, and your range is one and three quarters to 2.75. It looks optically a little bit optimistic and I realize what you said about supply, but I would imagine even first quarter supply, you’ll be competing with those units well until into the summer, even if they don’t get push back. So, I’m just curious how you stress your model and kind of got comfortable with especially the low end of that guidance range that I think a lot of people may look at, and say you know these guys might have to cut this later in the year?
Eric Bolton: Well, go ahead. I mean, I think that ultimately what we have done is look at the expect, -- with the expectation that a lot of the pressure that we saw on 2017’s results was a function of slippage of units into the weak fourth quarter leasing season and therefore the concession activity that took place of impacting effective pricing was ultimately a lot weaker as a consequence of that. As we think about 2018 you’re right and that you’ll see some of this lease up going on now taking place in Q2, Q3 but the good news is that the pipeline is quickly falling away based on everything that we’ve been able to see. And with us starting at a higher occupancy position this year versus where we were at this time last year that gives us, and as I said earlier, us now in a position of having the sort of revenue management platform sort of fully dialed in versus not dialed in on the Post portfolio at all this time last year we just start in a much stronger position. And so, it’s a combination of we think the market fundamentals are going to work more in our favor as the year plays out versus last year where the market fundamentals were getting worse as we got leading into the weaker part of the year and we have kind of just the opposite scenario from – in terms of market fundamentals this year. And then secondly, as I say, the platform is just in a better position – much better position as we started the year. Occupancy is in a stronger position including the legacy Post portfolio occupancy. So, when you just put all those factors together it leads us to sort of where we are. But as I say and I said earlier, this is all predicated on an assumption that the demand side equation holds up there is no reason to believe that that is unlikely to occur. So, we’re optimistic that these markets are going to continue to So, we’re optimistic that these markets are going to continue to yield the level of demand that we’re anticipating and as a consequence, we think we will get to where we’ve outlined.
Michael Lewis: And if I'll ask my second question about the legacy Post portfolio, obviously, the negative revenue. I’m wondering, it’s fair to think what’s left still that you do there besides just getting helped out by supply easing in the cycle helping you? Is there anything kind of I don't know what the word is transitory reason or something that's easily fixed like being on the new platform or the changes you've had to make in personnel? And along those lines too, do you think there's a significant amount of units there that might need CapEx to be competitive beyond just the units you see opportunities to renovate?
Eric Bolton: Yeah. So, I'll take quick run of that. The quick easy pops on the Post portfolio, in terms of performance opportunity right now we’re running 50 basis points ahead on occupancy and we'll have that opportunity over last year, we'll have that opportunity for early part of the year. The redevelopment opportunity, which I would say is more offensive in nature to make the units more competitive, that is – we'll probably double that volume this year versus last. And that's an enormous opportunity, that's – that is offensive in nature. The properties themselves are in great shape. And then thirdly, there are sort of some curb appeal opportunities there both on the landscape in the physical building that aren’t increasing the dollars that we're spending, but we're getting more bank for buck on the dollars that we're spending. And then in addition to the revenue management platform, that Eric touched on earlier, we’re starting the year with a team that’s really familiar with the properties, knows their ins and outs, understands submarkets. And this time last year, we were still learning that and everybody is sort of on the same page. Those things give me good hope. I’m optimistic about what the Post portfolio can do in 2018 despite the fact of the market conditions.
Michael Lewis: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Carol Kemple: Good morning. On acquisitions for the year, it sounds like you all have a good pipeline right now. For modeling purposes, do you think it’s better to spread it out evenly or do you think it will be more front end or back end loaded?
Eric Bolton: Probably, spread fairly evenly over the year. We have a couple of opportunities that we think are pretty strong in the first half of the year, but I think I will spread a portion over the back as well, so fairly evenly.
Carol Kemple: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks.
Eric Bolton: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Buck Horne: Hey, thanks guys, long call. I’ll try to be brief. Just going to the renewal rate increases you guys are pushing through, I just wanted to get a feel for your confidence level and that you can maintain your very low resident turnover ratios with still pushing through those 5% renewal increases this year? And maybe related to that, do you feel like your recurring CapEx budget for this year may need to go up to maintain those renewals?
Eric Bolton: No, I don’t think so, Buck. Where we feel like there is an opportunity to improve the product and get an incrementally higher rate, we’re renovating those units and that opportunity. And there is generally very little transaction involved with renewal and CapEx spending. Generally, they're making the decision based on their lifestyle at the time in the service and the value that we've created with them. And our teams are near obsessive in terms of how they work to serve our residents and capture that. And so, you know our sense is that the – this 5.5%, 5% to 5.5% will hold steady early into the first quarter, where we're seeing that hold just fine. And it held up through frankly the tougher fourth quarter as well.
Buck Horne: Okay. Thanks. And just a couple of quick market updates that I think maybe just to cover the all the bases. But just thinking, how do you think the year plays in terms of supply pressure in Charlotte and Tampa in particular?
Eric Bolton: In Charlotte, it is mostly focused on the – and in the sort of uptown, downtown area and south end if you will. And so that is – it’s about 3,500 units that’ll come in in the first quarter and it drops to 782 by the fourth quarter. So pretty significant fall off you know in sort of a linear fashion there. And then in Tampa, you know Tampa is actually we're seeing jobs to completions in Tampa and you know this well is jumping from five, four to nine there. So, with Tampa it doesn't have a huge supply, a lot of that is channel side. But that's a market that has the potential to upside – to have a stronger upside back half of the year than the company norm.
Buck Horne: Wonderful. Thanks for the call. Appreciate it.
Eric Bolton: You bet. Thank you, Bob.
Tom Grimes: Thanks, Bob.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Bilerman: Hey, it's Michael Bill, I'm here in with Nick. Eric, I sort of here with Nick. Eric, I sort of want to just come back in sort of evaluate where in the last 13 months, 14 months have been and clearly what was consistent missed expectations. And I dial back to August 3, 2016, when you announced the Post-merger and one of the big things that you were talking about back then was different than Colonial, and I think I remember I asked this question about what gives you the confidence of not having any sort of the same recurring issues that happened when you did that merger, and you made a big deal about being on the same type of systems that you've done that before that you're well tested. And now, what we're hearing is a lot of excuses about why 2017 was more challenging, right, you cut your same-store guidance twice last year and you still fell below what was the most recent cut that you gave with three quarter or third quarter results. You sort of blame a little bit of Post, you're blaming supply that was delayed, but I assume with supplies delayed that would have helped you earlier in the year when you cut twice. So, I'm just trying to put it all this together and hear a little bit more of effectively an apology of the performance.
Eric Bolton: Mike, I mean, I would tell you that we put together the outlook for 2017, based on the information and the insights that we had on expected supply dynamics, and I think that what -- I mean, going back to the Colonial scenario, I mean that was a completely different set of circumstances and so forth, and now we can get into more detail on that. But I think as far as 2017 is concerned, we've we wound up seeing the leasing conditions deteriorate more so in the back half of the year and in particular than we expected. And we started getting increasing visibility on that by you know April, May timeframe as projects that were supposed to be at least mark. And we knew that as a consequence of that, that the leasing would be taking, the lease up activity will be increasingly taking place in a weaker part of the year. And so, when you get in that kind of scenario, what you’re faced with is okay well how aggressive are the developers likely to get in terms of their concession practices and so forth and you know, we don’t have as good a visibility on that, because you know we don’t know what sort of financing arrangement any given developer has. And we don’t have any perspective – as given a perspective on exactly our insight as to you know what kind of pressure they’re going to have to get leased up sooner rather than later. And so, as a consequence of that, we just saw a concession practices in particularly some of the, you know sub markets like uptown in Dallas get a lot more aggressive. As a consequence of those delivery delays happening and creating more pressure in the back half of the year and the slower leasing season. So, it is what it is. I wish we had you know it could have had greater visibility on that. But when we started with guidance and in January of 2017, but it turned out the way, the way it did. The only other thing that I would add to this that you know I think probably did surprise us a little bit and fueled some of the weakness in 2017 is when we look at post situation late 2016 and early 2017, we looked at their occupancy, we looked at some of their revenue management practices, we saw a big opportunity. And we continue to feel very good about that opportunity. To be candid with you, what I was surprised by was how weak some of the onsite leadership was. And as a consequence of that, what we did not underwrite and what happened is, we wound up having to replace over half the post property managers. And as you may know, when you go through that kind of transition, everything just kind of slows, everything just – it’s a little harder to get down than you would have thought. And so, if there's any variable that I'll point to, that really was a surprise, it’s that. One other thing I'll also add though is important to remember is that, the original FFO guidance that we gave for 2017 was $5.82. The report that we just gave is $5.94. Take out $0.07 for this mark-to-market on the preferred $5.80. So, we beat our original FFO guidance for 2017.
Michael Bilerman: Right. Okay. Getting to a number is how you get to a number rather than the number itself, right. So, if we think about even 2018, holding more cash on the line of credit, which doesn't cost too much, you know levering up a little bit potentially doing some accretive acquisitions. The quality of that accretion is not as strong as the quality of operations, right. And if you think about your operations you started for 2017 at 3.25% same-store NOI, that dropped to 3% in the first quarter, it was held flat in the second quarter results in the summer, where arguably you should have had a better perspective of some of the supply and then, it was dropped 75 basis points at two in the quarter in the third quarter. And you came out at nearly in mid-November without any sort of update to 2017 and 2017 just fell to 2% to 2.11% 15 basis points below where you thought it was in late October. And so that's a pretty meaningful divergence when all of your apartment peers have generally met or beat their original expectations.
Eric Bolton: Well, what I can tell you is our markets, a lot of our markets solve the supply pressure later than some of the other markets. And this time last year, two years ago, we're come at a lot of supply pressure in other markets. So, the market dynamics got worse in our markets and for our portfolio particularly with Allison and Dallas, and it had the effect it did.
Tom Grimes: Let me add too on the fourth quarter performance, from our perspective, Mike, we didn't miss our fourth quarter performance in revenue. We got the expectations we had, we got there in a different way, we built occupancy a little bit, because concessions were coming down and we thought that was the right thing to do to allow those concessions to build strength for our platform to get better pricing performance in 2018. And so that's what we did, and that's what we built in our forecast with increased pricing in 2.25%, 2.75%, compared to what we talked about at NAREIT. But from our perspective, we didn't miss the fourth quarter from what we talked about where we outlined our guidance and talked about in November.
Michael Bilerman: Right. Your revenue guidance was you had brought it down to 2% to 2.5% to 2.25% in the midpoint you came in at 2.11%, 2.10%, so that would fall.
Eric Bolton: You cannot range, from my expectation, we never said that our performance was exactly on the midpoint. We have a range and we have a range and we – and our expectations that drove that guidance and drove the earnings was in line with what we talked about.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. All right, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I’ll go ahead and turn it back over to you Tim.
Tom Grimes: Thanks, Savannah. We have no further comments. Appreciate everybody joining the call. We’ll talk to you soon.
Operator: And this does conclude today’s call. Thank you everyone for your participation. You may disconnect at any time and have a great day.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-10-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, October 26, 2017. I would like now to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Savannah. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Rob DelPriore, General Counsel. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the safe harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34 ACT filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. FFO results for the third quarter, ignoring the credit associated with the mark-to-market adjustment on the preferred stock derivative, were ahead of our expectation. This result was achieved despite the unexpected expenses incurred during the quarter associated with the 2 hurricanes that affected our operations in Houston and in Florida. Leasing conditions in the third quarter, particularly in our larger markets, reflect the impact of elevated new supply levels and is more evident at the higher-end priced point and more urban-oriented locations in the portfolio. On a comparative basis, we continue to see better pricing performance across the majority of our secondary markets and more suburban locations. Most importantly, however, job growth in the resulting demand across the overall portfolio continues to hold up. While it varies somewhat by market, the ratio of job growth to new supply across the overall portfolio is in the range of 5 to 1, representing a generally healthy supply demand scenario, which enables us to capture strong occupancy and low resident turnover while generating solid growth and lease renewal pricing. We remain positive on internal earning growth prospects over the next few quarters for several reasons. First, projections continue to support a pullback in the permitting of new construction. As a result, we expect the current new delivery pressures to show some moderation over the back half of 2018. Our early projections of job growth to new supply across the total portfolio in 2018 reflect a slight improvement as compared to the trends in 2017. As a result of our balanced portfolio with investments across a wide range of markets and submarkets, we believe that overall market fundamentals as they apply to our markets will remain supportive of good demand, strong occupancy and solid overall pricing opportunities with renewal pricing continuing to outpace new lease pricing. Secondly, as Tom will outline in his comments, we are [indiscernible] benefits associated with reconciling the Post portfolio operation to MAA's practices, and we're confident this momentum will carry well into next year as a lot of the foundation was laid this year, especially on the revenue management side, and will be more impactful on leasing activity in 2018. We have both the legacy MAA Portfolio and the legacy Post portfolio well positioned for the slower winter leasing season and start to next year. And thirdly, we see a steady and growing contribution from our development in lease-up pipelines in 2018. One of the real value-add components we captured through our merger with Post was the development pipeline. And while it was at its most dilutive point in 2017, we will see this become a net positive contributor to earnings in 2018. As we've seen over the last couple of quarters, supply pressures continue to be more evident in the legacy Post portfolio. Despite these pressures, we continue to make progress in reconciling revenue management practices. The performance differences between the legacy Post and MAA Portfolios continue to narrow. During the quarter, within the legacy Post portfolio, we captured average daily occupancy of 95.7%, which was within 15 – 50 basis points of the average daily occupancy generated by the legacy MAA Portfolio. This is the best comparative result since our merger. In addition, the legacy Post portfolio captured strong growth in lease renewal pricing during the quarter, equaling the results captured from the legacy MAA Portfolio. New lease pricing moderated in August and in September from the trends we saw in July as new supply pressures picked up in several submarkets in the latter part of Q3. We will have to work through new supply challenges in several submarkets before rents on leases written to new move-in residents meaningfully improve. But we're encouraged with the continued strong performance in renewal lease pricing, while at the same time, seeing resident turnover remaining low. With new construction permitting trending down as well as great progress having been made over the year and repositioning the legacy Post portfolio to our revenue management protocols, we're optimistic that new lease pricing will show improvement in 2018. Our most persistent challenge continues to be external growth. Despite an increase in new supply and the associated pressure on new lease pricing, cap rates and market pricing on acquisition opportunities remains very robust. We continue to underwrite and actively review a number of opportunities. But absent some combination of attributes that creates a highly motivated seller, it's been a challenge to achieve pricing on acquisitions that we believe meet our disciplined protocols governing capital deployment. We're also analyzing several new development opportunities, but likewise, find that upward pressure on construction labor and material costs is challenging our willingness to commit capital at the moment. I expect we'll get some activity underway on both the acquisition and development fronts over the coming year, but certainly, the buying bonanza or a rise in cap rates that sometimes accompanies supply induced moderation in leasing conditions hasn't shown up in this cycle, at least not yet. We have the balance sheet in a very strong position with ample capacity support this opportunity when it does appear. Out team continues to make great progress in working through the many tasks associated with integrating the legacy Post platform with our MAA operating practices. As we've seen over the course of this year, the early wins surrounding reductions in property operating expenses continued in Q3. As noted in the third quarter, growth in same-store expenses was impacted by hurricane-related expenditures, and we fully expect the fourth quarter to reflect the positive trends we saw earlier this year. We remain excited about the additional opportunities remaining to capture in 2018 surrounding revenue management protocols, maintenance operations and a significant unit interior redevelopment opportunity that will carry forward well past next year. Finally, I want to send my thanks and appreciation to our team for their hard work over the busy summer season and the extra effort that was required from this year's active hurricane season. MAA has completed a significant amount of growth and change over the past few years, and the platform is in a significantly stronger position. I hope to see many of you at our upcoming Investor Day on November 13, where we plan to lay out the strengths of the platform and our outlook for the company. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll now turn it over to Tom.
Tom Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Same-store revenues for the quarter were up 1.7% over the prior year with 96.1% average daily occupancy. Looking at this portfolio, the legacy MAA portfolio revenues were up 2.4% with 96.2% average daily occupancy and effective rent growth of 2.8%. The legacy Post portfolio had revenues of negative 0.5% with 95.7% average daily occupancy and effective rent growth of 0.2%. The performance gap between the two portfolios is driven by higher new supply in the Post submarkets as well as differences in our operating practices. We have, of course, been focused on achieving full alignment in operating practices between the two portfolios. We have made good progress, and results are starting to show up. This momentum will carry into 2018. We have improved Post occupancy about 50 basis points since the beginning of the year, and we feel we have another 40 basis points to go. October to date, Post blended rents are up 2% on a lease-over-lease basis. This is 40 basis points better than October of 2016. Said another way, we have increased proposed blended lease rates on a lease-over-lease basis by 310 basis points from the first quarter and have driven average daily occupancy up by 50 basis points. This has occurred as the Post submarkets have faced growing competition from new deliveries. We believe that the data cleanup and resetting of the many variables within the revenue management system will drive enhanced performance as we work through the releasing of the portfolio on the coming year. While it takes time for the improvement in pricing to show up in portfolio revenue performance, the expense progress has been immediate. Excluding the hurricane-related expenses, total expenses for the quarter were up just 1.4% and year-to-date expense growth for the Post portfolio is down 0.7%. That's driven by improvements in personnel, repair and maintenance as well as property and casualty insurance. As a result, the Post NOI margin is expected to improve 40 basis points this year. We expect this to grow as we see benefits from the completed foundational work of our revenue management systems and continue to harvest opportunities on the expense side of the equation. Looking forward, we're well positioned for the slower winter months. October occupancy is expected to close at 96% and a 60-day exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is below 7%. The early read on the fourth quarter renewals is encouraging as we are averaging 5.7% increases achieved and January offers went out at 7%. While elevated supply levels moderated overall revenue growth, we're still seeing good growth in many markets. Fort Worth, Raleigh, Charleston and Richmond all stood out from the group. Houston has been our market level worry bead, but it appears to be stabilizing. After hurricane Harvey, our occupancy increased from 96.2% to 97%. Our 60-day exposure there is just 4.2%. We have held pricing at prestorm levels, but expect them to climb as normal operations return. On the supply front, Dallas and Austin are facing the most pressure. Expected deliveries for 2017, our 16,000 for Dallas and 7,000 for Austin. These deliveries represent 3% of inventory in both markets. We are encouraged that job growth has remained strong in both Austin and Dallas. For 2017, Dallas job growth is 2.2% and Austin job growth is 2.1%, which compares favorable to the 2017 national average of just 1.4%. This improves in 2018 with both markets expected to grow at 2.4% versus the national average of 1.5%. Renter demand remained steady on our current - residents continue to choose to stay with us. Move-outs for the portfolio were down 3.2% for the quarter. Turnover remained low at 50.4% on a rolling 12-month basis. Move-outs to home buying and move-outs to home renting were down 5.5% and 3%, respectively. As you know, much of the Post product is in inner loop areas that are seeing the most supply. While this puts pressure on our newer product and creates opportunity on the older product in excellent locations. We plan to invest $112 million to redevelop units in the Post communities over the next three to four years. This is our most accretive method to allocate capital. There are 13,000 units that have compelling redevelopment, 13,000 Post units that have compelling redevelopment opportunities. We can make these great locations more competitive by updating the product. We have room to raise the rents and still be well below the rates of the new product coming online. We're just getting away on the – getting underway on the Post redevelopment program. Through the quarter, we have completed $9.5 million in renovations on over 1,100 units. On average, we're spending $8,600 and getting a rent increase that's 12% more than a comparable non-redeveloped unit. On the full MAA Portfolio, year-to-date, we have completed over 6,500 interior unit upgrades. And on legacy MAA, our redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remains robust. On a combined basis, our total redevelopment pipeline is in the neighborhood of 30,000 units. That translates into a total pipeline of $170 million of very accretive capital deployment opportunity. As you can tell from the release, our lease-up communities are performing well. Leasing is gone better than expected at Charlotte, Midtown and Nashville, and that stabilization date was moved up a quarter – to the fourth quarter of this year. The Retreat at West Creek 2, Colonial Grand at Randall Lakes 2, Post Parkside at 2 and 1201 Midtown 1, all stabilized on schedule this quarter. We're actively leasing the Denton II, Post South Lamar 2, Post Midtown and Post River North, and they are progressing well. It's been a busy quarter for our teams, and we're pleased with our progress. The building momentum in the Post portfolio is particularly encouraging. We look forward to continuing to capture value-creation opportunities on both the revenue and expense side of the equation. Al?
Al Campbell: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally, on guidance for the remainder of 2017. Net income available for common shareholders was $1 per diluted common share for the quarter. FFO for the quarter was $1.50 per share, which was $0.06 above the midpoint of our previous guidance. The third quarter performance included $0.035 per share for noncash income from the valuation of an embedded derivative included with the preferred shares acquired from Post, which I'll discuss a bit more in just a moment. Before considering a $0.02 per share impact from the hurricane-related costs, total property NOI for the third quarter, including non same-store, was in line with expectations. Favorable G&A, interest and other income produced the majority of the remaining outperformance for the quarter, offsetting the storm costs and producing $0.02 per share with additional favorability. As briefly discussed in our prior releases, the $0.035 per share of noncash income related to the preferred shares acquired is in short due to accounting rules that require we bifurcate an assumed embedded derivative related to the call option on the shares. The derivative must be recorded as an asset and the mark-to-market each period through earnings. Volatile trading during the third quarter produced a sizable noncash adjustment, which really bears no real economic benefit and will potentially reverse at some point in the future. Higher supply pressures in many of our urban-oriented locations did pressure our revenue performance more than expected for the third quarter, primarily in the legacy Post portfolio. Overall blended pricing of 2.6% for the quarter was below our projection of just over 3%. Also, average occupancy performance of 96.1% for the quarter, while strong, did not reach the higher prior level amount of 96.3% as projected, which drove the bulk of the difference from our projections from – for the third quarter. However, pricing trends for the Post portfolio continued to improve over the previous quarter, we remain excited about the opportunity to capture stronger performance from operating practices over the next several quarters. Partially offsetting the revenue moderation was continued strong expense performance during the quarter. Same-store operating expenses for the legacy Post portfolio, excluding real estate taxes, declined almost 5% compared to the prior year, as we continue to capture savings from both operating practices and scale. During the quarter, four communities within our lease-up portfolio were fully stabilized and one development community, Post Midtown, was completed and moved into the lease-up portfolio. Our current lease-up portfolio now contains three communities, totaling 999 units with an average occupancy of 61.5% at quarter end. One community is expected to stabilize during the fourth quarter with the final two projected to stabilize mid to late 2018. During the third quarter, we funded an additional $33 million of development costs, bringing our year-to-date funding to $143 million. Our current development pipeline now contains five projects with a total projected cost of $305 million, with only $70 million remaining to be funded. These five projects are expected to produce an average 6.3% stabilized NOI yield once completed and leased-up, with three of the projects projected to be completed by the first quarter of 2018 and the remaining two completed in the back half of 2018. During the quarter, we sold three wholly-owned communities located in the Lakeland, Florida; Montgomery, Alabama; and Fort Worth, Texas. The total proceeds of $88.4 million represented a strong pricing for 28 year old assets on average and produced a 5.3% economic cap rate. We also exited two tertiary markets with these sales. We currently have two additional communities located in Atlanta under contract for sale, which are expected to close during the fourth quarter for growth proceeds of approximately $98 million. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. During the third quarter, we paid off $150 million of senior unsecured notes assumed for Post as well as a $14 million secured mortgage with our unsecured line of credit. At quarter end, our leverage, as defined by our bond covenants, was 33.2%, while our net debt was only 5.3x recurring EBITDA. At quarter end, 85% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective interest rate of only 3.5%, with well laddered maturities averaging 4.4 years. At quarter end, we had over $795 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility, providing both liquidity and support for our business plans. Given our current expectations for acquisitions and dispositions over the remainder of year, along with our projection for excess cash approaching $100 million, we did not anticipate new equity needs this year and expect to end the year with our leverage around current levels. Finally, we updated our earnings guidance for the full year to reflect the third quarter performance and updated expectations for the remainder of the year. We are updating guidance for net income per diluted common share, which is then reconciled to updated FFO and AFFO guidance in the supplement. Net income per diluted common share is now projected to be $2.76 to $2.86 per share for the full year of 2017. FFO is now projected to be $5.84 to $5.94 per share or $5.89 at the midpoint, which includes $0.15 per share of merger and integration costs for the full year. AFFO is projected to be $5.25 to $5.35 per share or $5.30 at the midpoint. We adjusted our FFO guidance for the full year by adding $0.02 per share at the midpoint. We expect continued volatility in the noncash earnings related to the embedded option acquired with the Post preferred shares, and we have allowed $0.02 of this of the recent favorability to reverse during the fourth quarter. We've also extended recent operating trends through the remainder of the year, with projected fourth quarter revenue performance based on an expectation of continued stable occupancy at current levels and blended pricing on move-ins and renewals during the fourth quarter reflecting normal seasonality, averaging 1.5% higher on a lease-over-lease basis, which is in line with prior year. The combination of these factors as well as a more favorable prior year comparison and occupancy is expected to produce fourth quarter revenues above third quarter. As you saw in our supplement, we are revising our guidance expectations for the combined adjusted same-store Portfolio. We now project revenues to grow 2% to 2.5% for the full year and operating expenses to grow 1.75% to 2.25%. This is expected to produce NOI growth for the year 2% to 2.5% range, including a 30 basis points impact from the storm costs incurred in third quarter. We also revised guidance for acquisition volume for the remainder of the year to reflect the competitive landscape. The top end of our acquisition range now includes closing one additional deal prior to year-end. We also tightened our range for development investment for the year, reflecting revised timing of funding. We remain on track to capture the full $20 million of overhead synergies related to the Post merger on a run rate basis by year-end, and we're a little ahead of timing expectations for this as reflected in our revised guidance. As we also – and we also expect to continue capturing additional NOI opportunities over the next several quarters as the operating practices and platforms become fully integrated. And that's all we have in the way of prepared comments, Savannah, so now we'll turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we can go first to Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. It's been almost a year since you closed on the acquisition of Post. So curious how actual results have compared to underwriting, particularly in terms of operating performance?
Eric Bolton: Nick, this is Eric. We know that at this point in the cycle that the submarkets that largely define the Post portfolio, we're going to be under more stress. I think the – we also knew that we had some great opportunity to rework some operating practices and capture, we think, better performance than what was being delivered. But the pressure on the supply side, particularly in Dallas and Austin, has noticeably picked up in the last 90 days or so. And that has created some of the pressures that we're talking about here as it relates to outlook for the rest of this year. But the fact is that we did this merger with a goal of further enhancing our full cycle strategy. We knew that at this point in the cycle, the Post locations would be under more pressure. But that at later parts on the cycle, those locations really service very well and likely would exceed the performance expectations that we get out of the legacy MAA locations. So ultimately, we continue to feel very positive about the full cycle. Enhancement that comes from putting the portfolio in with the MAA portfolio, none of that has changed as a consequence of anything that we've seen. And so we've explained in the past, the redevelopment opportunity is frankly bigger than we thought it was going to be. And so we've remained very excited, and I will tell you, very confident in the $650 million value-creation opportunity that we've previously laid out that comes from this merger.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Appreciate that. And then just in terms of same-store revenue guidance. Year-to-date, it's been disappointing. You've reduced it to twice. So I'm just curious what gives you the confidence in the fourth quarter that year-over-year growth will accelerate from what you've seen in the third quarter in this year?
Al Campbell: This is Al. I think as we move into the fourth quarter, first, occupancy is a very strong level, it's 96%. Our exposure is low in the portfolio. We've seen pricing as we moved into – as we talk about – I'll talk about it, more comments, we're expecting fourth quarter pricing blended to be 1.5%, which is on top of the prior year. And we're seeing that a little better already in October. And so those things provide comment – I mean, confidence in that as we move through the best rest of the year and what we've put out. And Tom, do you have anything to add to that?
Tom Grimes: Yes, I would just say, Nick, in October, as Al mentioned, we're below 7% on exposure. And on the post assets, the blended new lease pricings about 40 basis points higher than October of last year. And that's – if that holds through the quarter, that will be the first time we've seen that all in the third quarter. We're encouraged by that.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to understand some of the moving pieces in your FFO guidance if you strip out some of those onetime items and the hurricane costs. So it seems like there was about a $0.03 per share net benefit from onetimers, which is then being offset by the decrease from lower same-store NOI and lower G&A. You mentioned there was a $0.02 reversal, I believe. So net-net, stripping those out, is the $0.02 increase coming from other kind of noncore items that you expect to be recurring, either in interest expense or some other line item? Can you just clarify that, please?
Al Campbell: Yes. I mean, we've looked at a couple of ways, Nick – I'm sorry about that, Austin. And I think, the main point we make is whichever way you look at, there's a lot of noise in the quarter and the updated guidance for the year includes that. But whether you look at, including the non-cash benefit from option as well as the storm costs, you have a beat of about $0.02. And whether you exclude the strip out both of those items, you have a beat of about $0.02. So that's kind of how we thought about that, and we can work that through. The way I would think about the fourth quarter or the full year update for the guidance is, we had a third quarter beat of $0.06. We have allowed about $0.035 of favorability, and third quarter came from an option. We've allowed for about $0.02 of that to turn around, as we do expect to continue volatility in that as interest rates rise probably. And then we've adjusted our guidance, as you said, from same-store to some of the other items in our forecast. And all of that together combines another $0.02. So $0.06 minus those – that $0.04 is a $0.04 beat – I mean, excuse me, $0.02 beat. But how are we going to look it up, I think it will shake out to be about $0.02 beat.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks. That's helpful. And then on the redevelopment side, you mentioned you've done about 1,100 units so far with achieving a 12% rent increase. What markets of those redevelopments been in at this point? And given the new lease rates have been stubbornly low across the Post portfolio, I mean, what gives you the confidence you can continue to achieve that as you roll it out across other markets?
Tom Grimes: Yes. So I mean, we’re active in just about every Post market, except for Raleigh, which is brand new. And what we do with that, Austin, I mean, we’re continuing to test renovated units next to non-renovated units, and – so that you’re making sure that you’re getting that price increase. Our redeveloped or renovated units are leasing about four days faster than our non-redeveloped on those opportunities. And frankly, we believe, long-term, it will work. For some reason, that particular redevelopment doesn’t work. We just stop it, and we wait for the next opportunity. But frankly, we’ve been accelerating at this point and feel pretty good on the returns.
Eric Bolton: And also, I would tell you that, I mean, what we see is even with some of these more competitive submarkets of the Post locations with new supply, even with the effective pricing that these new communities are trying to offer to get leased up. We’re still able to undercut their pricing through this redevelopment effort and still create a very creative use of capital. So while, certainly, I understand the point that the new lease pricing is under more pressure in some of these submarket locations, the redevelopment opportunity is so significant that it is not really creating a meaningful headwind to that effort.
Austin Wurschmidt: That’s a good color. Thank you. And then just last one for me, I want to touch on Dallas. You mentioned that’s been a heavy supply market. Occupancy was down 100 bps year-over-year. Revenue growth was flat. I mean, is Dallas at risk of going negative – is revenue growth in Dallas at risk of going negative into 2018?
Tom Grimes: Yes. I think, we need to monitor Dallas closely and I think that is a risk. We saw sort of a concession environment in Dallas, I mean, pick up in the latter part of the quarter and we think there’s pressure there.
Al Campbell: What I would...
Austin Wurschmidt: Any particular submarket...
Al Campbell: What I would tell you is, I mean, the uptown submarket is clearly where the most pressure is occurring for our portfolio that we’re seeing a little bit in North Dallas, but the uptown market in particular. What gives us – what I think happens in Dallas is, I think, it probably is under more pressure over the first two quarters of next year and probably gets a little bit easier over the last two quarters of next year. We think that renewal pricing will continue to hold strong. We’ll continue to capture very – pretty strong occupancy. The problem will run in – or the challenge is that the prior year comps are tougher in the first half of the year and they get a little bit easy in the back half of the year. So I think that, on balance, if I look at Dallas as a whole for the year, I have a hard time getting to a negative result. But I think you may see more pressure in the first half of the year versus the back half of the year. The question for Dallas is, if that job growth holds as well as it is in 2018 – early look at 2018 is pretty darn strong, frankly, a little bit better than 2017, Dallas will be okay.
Austin Wurschmidt: And what are concessions today in Dallas? You mentioned they have increased.
Tom Grimes: Yes. No, it ranges by submarkets. So we’re seeing one to six weeks free. We’re seeing in the market and like Frisco and McKinney and other parts of North Dallas, uptown, as Eric touched on a little more aggressive. We’ve got several comps that are doing two months free, but normal is about one to two months free in uptown.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Lewis: Thanks. So a lot to talk about Austin and Dallas. As I kind of look down the markets that decelerated the year-over-year growth from quarter-to-quarter, Nashville, Tampa, South Florida, Greensville, Jackson, maybe all storm related. I was just curious if there’s any – if there’s a trend in any of those worth talking about, and maybe it relates to the storm. I know in Houston, a lot of us start looking at that, thinking, that, that makes the market tighter and market rent might go up. Are there other markets like that maybe in Florida?
Tom Grimes: I would tell you that the storm benefits Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, not to the degree that Orlando – that Harvey did in Houston. The other thing that goes on is Orlando, particularly gets a ton of immigration from Puerto Rico, and that is a – that’s a market that may well get tighter as a result of, frankly, the tough times that they’re having down there.
Michael Lewis: Okay. And the deceleration in same-store revenue growth in like Nashville and Tampa, is there anything going on there? Or is that just a...
Tom Grimes: Yes. I mean, Tampa, it really is a split between the Post assets and the MAA assets. But October for Post is now 95% non-average daily. In October, blended rent increases 2.8% there. And then legacy MAA is was 96.2%, but frankly, they were just facing a tougher comp with higher occupancy in prior quarter and last year at 96.5%.
Eric Bolton: Yes. And Nashville is a market that got a fair amount of supply this year. We think it starts to – I mean, if you look at the early projections for next year, the supply levels moderate in Nashville a good debt, and we think Nashville probably has an easier go of it next year versus this year.
Michael Lewis: Okay, thanks. And then the – on the development side, realizing that it’s tough to maybe to find new developments, you hope to find some in the next year. But on the stuff that’s underway, is there anything on labor or other costs that’s maybe squeezed in the cost side? And then anything in the markets on the rent side to cause you to maybe adjust your yield assumptions on the stuff that’s underway?
Eric Bolton: No, nothing. We’re far enough for long, frankly, in what we already have underway at this point that any material change in our forecast is highly unlikely. I mean, all those contracts are very well set and not really subject or at risk of any sort of cost escalations. And so everything that we’ve got underway right now, we don’t have any concerns about delivering the stabilized yields that we’ve long believed we’re going to be there.
Michael Lewis: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Drew Babin: Hey, good morning.
Eric Bolton: Hey, Drew.
Drew Babin: Following up on – just another development question. I noticed the stabilized yield expectation went to 6.3% from 6.5% this quarter. Is that the effect of Post midtown exiting the pipeline? Or is something happening with the rent projections for the pipeline as a whole?
Tim Argo: No. This is Tim, Drew. That was the impact of moving post midtown to the lease-up group. It was about a 7% yield, still expected to base and the other one stayed as it is.
Drew Babin: Okay. And then as far as Post happened at Oaks goes in Houston, I noticed the occupancy went up quite a bit in the third quarter relative to 2Q. Do you think Harvey had a positive impact there? And did you see anything in October sort of post 3Q of this evidence of continued strength there?
Tom Grimes: Yes. I mean, Harvey was a significant benefit there. We jumped from 62% to 80% – or 64% to 84% in just a few weeks, honestly, Drew, in that helped us a lot there on the lease-up.
Drew Babin: Okay. And lastly on the concession environment, I appreciate the color on what's going on in Dallas. Could we point out any other markets for the concessions or in some cases, two months or that sort of year? And I guess, I mean, given the supply, it was relatively non-quantity going into this year. The concession environment has been a little more competitive. What do you think is behind that? As far as the private developers are concerned, is there worries about interest rates on many term loans? Is it – there are some other factor that might be causing them to be more aggressive with concessions right now?
Tom Grimes: Austin, I can't speak to developers' motivation. I'd tell you, Austin, is the other market where we're seeing, on average, probably one month. And then in a few pockets, in certain some markets, it might jump to two. But on average, it's one. And I think that has to do with the amount of supply in the market, and folks are very interested in getting their products stabilized.
Eric Bolton: Drew, I would – this is Eric. I would tell you, yes, I absolutely believe that, as we get later into this cycle in markets like Dallas, particularly in a submarket like uptown where you've got quite a bit of supply coming online, I think with the likelihood of some – of these rising rates, I think developers are getting most anxious to go ahead and get leased up and get things stabilized, prove out their rent as best they can. And it's the one thing that gives me some belief that there may be more compelling buying opportunities as we get into next year because I think that a lot of these guys are rushing for the door in terms of getting the property stabilized. They much rather come to market and sell it well into the lease-up where they've got a track record they can point to in terms of rents and leasing velocity. The concession is notwithstanding. They really look at just the stated rents and use that as a basis to try to capture really robust pricing on the sale of the asset. And so I think there is increasing pressure on the developers to get leased up, and I think that's what's leading to some of the more active concession practices that Tom has alluded to.
Drew Babin: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Gaurav Mehta: Thanks, good morning. So I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about new lease moderation in August and September. I was wondering if that were only restricted to Austin and Dallas or you saw that trend into the markets as well?
Tom Grimes: I'm sorry, Gaurav, I didn't hear the first part of the question.
Gaurav Mehta: Starting in the prepared remarks, you said new lease moderated in August and September. I was wondering if that was only in Austin and Dallas or you saw that in other markets as well.
Tom Grimes: It was most pronounced in Dallas and Austin. That is – that was the heavy concessions coming into play in those markets, nothing dramatically out of the ordinary and the other ones.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay. And I'm sorry if I missed this, but can you provide new lease and renewal growth rate for 3Q?
Tom Grimes: Yes. New lease and renewal for the third quarter were – new lease was 0.357 and 2.6% blended.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay.
Al Campbell: 0.3 was new. Renewals were 5.7%...
Tom Grimes: Renewals were up 5.7%. Sorry, I'm...
Al Campbell: And new lease was a negative point.
Tom Grimes: And blended was 2.6%.
Al Campbell: I'm having trouble getting that out to today, Gaurav. New lease, negative 0.3%; renewal, positive 5.7%; blended, 2.6%. Sorry to reiterate on you our rate report.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Guinee: Great. John Guinee here, thank you. Couple of questions. First, construction cost, up; rent, slower; land, not really moving down yet or landowners not reflecting lower expectations on land. What are the merchant builders targeting on a yield on costs relative to what's your targeting? And then second is, you've got about $57 million of land on your balance sheet, which looks to me like maybe that could support 2,000 to 3,000 units, what's your thinking on that land?
Eric Bolton: So the land that we do own, there is – you're right, there is some of it that we do believe we will want to move on, and we're particularly looking at sites in Dallas and then Raleigh currently. But as I alluded to in my opening comments based on where we are seeing the current environment cost coming out at, we are – we have not yet actually pull the trigger to start in these projects. We also have a site in Denver that we're excited to get underway at some point. My guess is these things will start to make more sense next year, and we will likely, I would hope, be underway with some of this next year. As far as merchant builder, yield on cost, I don’t know exactly what you’re looking to do, my guess is they’re not probably, I mean, looking for yields sort of materially different than what we would look to achieve the differences that they’re going to use a lot more leverage in order to sort of finance their investment, buildup and construction and so forth. And there’s a consequence to that, come in with a pretty competitive blended cost to capital. But from our perspective, as we look at underwriting and look at the cost and the current leasing environment, we just – we’ve elected to hold off on starting anything new just yet. I think, like I said, it make more sense next year.
John Guinee: Okay. And then the second comment is – it’s look like you’ve got about a $16 billion total enterprise value. And I think you quoted, maybe I got this wrong, about $112 million of redevelopment, kitchens and baths. Can that $112 million really even move the needle in terms of earnings growth or FFO growth?
Al Campbell: Yes. I mean, it clearly can, I think. I mean, you’re talking roughly 30,000 apartments out of 100,000 apartments that we think have significant rent growth opportunities associated with it. It’s not a – it doesn’t happen in 1 quarter, even in 1 year. I mean, that’s a 2- or 3-year endeavor. So it’s a gradual sort of impact. But certainly, I think the impact, once complete, is pretty meaningful.
Tom Grimes: I’ll just add to that...
Al Campbell: That’s a just the Post portfolio. For the combined portfolio, It’s more like a $170 million. I think Tom mentioned that.
Tom Grimes: Yes, that’s correct.
Al Campbell: Just saying, we’ve done that program – done this program successfully for many years, and it does contribute somewhere 25 to 40 basis points of revenue over time – each annually as we do – if we do this program every year at the same pace. And of course, we think we’ll ramp this program up with Post over the next few years given the opportunities.
John Guinee: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Market. Please go ahead your line is open.
Neil Malkin: Hey, guys. Thanks. How much – can you talk about the OpEx opportunities or synergies? You’ve obviously been very clear about the G&A and property management, but it sounds like you have some more levers to pull on the actual OpEx side. Can you just kind of talk about what that looks like heading into ‘18 and how that kind of feeds into what OpEx growth on the same-store basis could look like next year?
Tom Grimes: Sure. I’ll take, certainly, the first part of it. The major driver on the operating expense is a combination of personnel and R&M cost. And we sort of blend those together as a total maintenance cost. And the post communities, we’re running close to 40% higher than the MAA communities on a per unit basis. And really that was the combination of our scale, which is we were able to reduce their contract purchasing cost by 10%. We were able to cut some of their vendor cost like a contract painting about 50%. And during the year, what we’ve been able to do is reduce that by about half, but we feel like Post is still about 20% higher than MAA. And it’s just more of that sort of maturing at the platforms that will have another about 20% to go on that side of things.
Al Campbell: Just add that at all together, as you begin to look at next year, we’re certainly not giving guidance at this point. But just thinking about next year is, you have the opportunity from the Post continue capture, as Tom mentioned. We have general control on all the other expenses for the business. And then if you think about real estate taxes, it’s 1/3 of that line item, it’s been our biggest pressure over the last few years, and it should begin moderating some. I mean, it will take several years for it to get back down to normal long-term run rate levels. But given the performance in Dallas and Austin and some of the Texas markets, and Texas being the biggest piece of that, we would expect some moderation to begin next year, helping us feel good about expenses for the full year next year.
Neil Malkin: All right, got you. And then on the other revenue side. On a per-unit basis, it seems like it’s been – it actually has been going negative slightly this year compared to your rental revenue growth. Can you talk about why that’s happening? And do you see that kind of reversing course next year? What kind of get that going or stop slowing like it is currently?
Tom Grimes: It’s primarily occupancy related on volume. And we think is that, that picks up, we will pick up there as well.
Al Campbell: And part of it in third quarter, it was also reimbursements, which is utilities expenses, and utilities expenses was lower in the third quarter than it has been. And so the reimbursement for that a little lower as well. And so over time, that will change as well.
Neil Malkin: I agree. And then last one for me is, if you look at the job markets, your footprint pretty much screens the best out of any of the peers in terms of just strength of jobs and where [indiscernible] are pretty strong as well, particularly in the secondary markets. Just – could you comment on why you think you haven’t seen that parlay into maybe stronger blended rents or more strength on the newly side rather?
Eric Bolton: Well, I think, I mean, what happened is that the supply trends, I think, have been gradually picking up. I think that, as we talked about earlier, I think as we get later in the cycle, these lease-up projects and the merchant builders who brought them online gets a little bit more aggressive in what they’re prepared to do in terms of pricing to achieve move-ins sooner. And as a consequence to that, I think we just happen to be at an inflection point in this third quarter where those trends really became pretty much more significant than what we’ve seen earlier in the year. I think this will dissipate over the next 2 or 3 quarters as these projects get leased up. As I alluded to, the permitting is clearly expected to come down. And I think the sort of relationship between demand and supply starts to work more favorably in our direction over the back half of next year. We’ve had consistently steady strong demand as you point out as a consequence to good job growth in these markets that we’re in. It’s just that the supply side of the equation has created this moderation, and developer pricing tactics have become a little more aggressive at this point in the cycle. And so we're just at that point in the process or in the cycle where it's kind of the tough point, and we see it sort of troughing over the next couple of quarters and then starting a climb back. And I've always believed very much in the merits of deploying capital in a way where the demand is likely to be there and be the strongest over a full cycle. We know we're going to deal with supply pressures from time to time, and that there'll be points in the process where there's – the pressure gets pretty intense and you just kind of put your head down and grind through it, and that's kind of where we are right now. But I think that we have a lot of confidence in the markets that we're in long term because of what you're alluding to, because we know demand is likely to be there better than what we see in a lot of other markets across the country.
Neil Malkin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go to next Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Buck, your line is open. Please check your mute function.
Buck Horne: Sorry about that. Good morning, guys. I think you guys have been pretty clear about the supply being the major issue. But just given where we stood at the end of July and kind of the sharpness of the deterioration or just the guidance reduction that occurred relative to where we stood last quarter, I just want to be clear that you think the pressure really is coming from external supply issues. Or was there any issue internally when you rebooted the Post LRO system? Was there any sort of hiccup internally that may have caused any revenue hiccup?
Eric Bolton: Buck, this is Eric. Absolutely not. We have not had any internal hiccup or however you want to define it at all. And we – the surprise frankly – and we have a lot of concentration of assets in Dallas in that uptown area. And that, in particular, is where we saw some pretty aggressive pricing practices really kick in. As we said at the end of July, we were matching prior year occupancy. Our blended rent growth across both portfolios was moving in a positive direction. And for the quarter, we candidly had a very difficult prior year occupancy comparison to deal with, particularly on the Post side of all things. They really rent up the occupancy in Q3 last year. Now it materially fell off right after that, particularly as you get towards the end of the year and into next year. But they had a very full portfolio third quarter of last year, so we had a difficult comp. I mean what's interesting to look at when you just look at sort of where we came in, our revenues relative to our expectation, the vast majority of the miss, if you want to think about it that way, was occupancy. And so 27 basis points difference in terms of this year's occupancy, effective daily occupancy versus last year's effective daily It was really strong this year, but it was really, really strong last year. So 27 basis points off, and that's what really – we thought we could get there, but we – as we start heading into the winter, we thought we better back off a little bit on some of these pricing practices and try to get that occupancy protected as best as we can as we head into the winter months. And as we start to look at sort of what's happening in the market, we thought, I think it's going to be a slugfest to some of these submarkets for the next, call it, two quarters. And then you get on top of that kind of normal seasonal activity. And when you put all of that together, it suggest to us that we ought to sort of adjust as we have.
Buck Horne: Okay, that's very helpful color. And going back to the supply outlook for going into next year. You mentioned you're feeling better, that's about the second half of next year with permitting trends. But maybe just thinking a bit more broadly in terms of your secondary markets and maybe just your suburban locations, whether it's legacy MAA or otherwise, are you starting to see developers push out into the more suburban or secondary markets to – chasing a little bit more development yield? How does the supply outlook look out there?
Eric Bolton: We haven't really seen any pressure there, Buck. And may the outlook next year is better than this year in that segment of portfolio. I mean, these – I knew sooner or later these secondary markets would outperform the large markets. And finally, we're here. And it's been that way now, last quarter and this quarter, and probably that way for the next couple of quarters. So they're doing exactly what they're supposed to do for us, and we're not seeing anything change in terms of pressure in those markets. I think they're holding up quite well.
Tom Grimes: And Buck, where we think about an improvement in terms of deliveries for '18, it's actually in large markets. Atlanta drops from 8,600 to 6,500, Charlotte goes down from 5,100 to 3,300, Houston gets a ton better and Orlando actually improves modestly as does Tampa. So those were – that's really where we think of it, it's improving in those markets.
Buck Horne: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go to next to Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Nick Yulico: Thanks. Going back to the guidance, specifically, on same-store revenue. So your prior guidance assume that you would have same-store revenue accelerate in the back half of the year and part of that was because of new lease growth also improving. And so I'm trying to understand your previous thinking of why you thought that was reasonable that would happen, especially when you have 25% exposure in Atlanta and Dallas, where there is a lot of supply. Why are you still optimistic now versus building in some caution?
Eric Bolton: Yes, I'll start and then I'll let Al. Because new lease pricing have been steadily climbing for seven months straight and there had never been a decline until we got to August. And so it was moving at a very steady pace up. And in Dallas, in particular, and somewhat in Austin, we saw pricing practices and the market get considerably more aggressive as we start to get towards the end of leasing season and efforts are made to get stabilized. The four things really slow down when you get into the holiday season. Based on what we saw happening, it suggested to us that we should moderate our thinking a little bit. But until we got to August, new lease pricing across both portfolios was steadily improving and steadily moving up. And we – July was the best month we'd had. So that's sort of what feels it a little bit. And Al...
Al Campbell: I'll just give you what was in there, and exactly – Eric's point was exactly what occurred. And so if you remember talking about it, Nick, we said what we were seeing was very good in July. We're seeing blended pricing of 3%. So we felt like that, that the trends are great. We carry that through the year. Say we'll get blended pricing of 3% a little better for the year, we'll get occupancy on top of the prior year levels. And so though occupancy in the third quarter was very good. And 96.1%, it was a very tough comp to the prior year. And that was the biggest piece and then reach the 96.3%. And so blended pricing we dig, it was 2.6%. It's good pricing, but didn't reach the – we saw the falloff. And on August and September in primary locations that Tom and Eric talked about. So that's what occurred. It caused us to look at fourth quarter and then roll that through the fourth quarter, put a little bit more seasonality and normal trends in our forecast now. Having said that, we still believe, as we talked about, in the positive attributes to come. And revenue, the next several quarters from the Post in the premise we're doing practices, that is still to come. It's just taking a little bit more time in terms of laying out in the future than what we have before.
Nick Yulico: Right. I guess, it goes back to an issue that's tapping before in the multifamily industry where companies are looking at pricing data realtime and then supply hits and there's an impact, and it's a surprise to negative. And it goes back to, I guess, the question of how you actually forecasting with future supply impact. And so I'm wondering if you've changed your thinking now. As you are still going through some markets like Dallas, Atlanta, others where there's meaningful supply, does that change how you think about ultimately when you get a forecast for 2018 and the supply impact?
Al Campbell: Certainly rolled into fourth quarter, a change. As we talk about, we took our – you just saw the guidance come down and we moderate to more seasonal norms. And so as we have to look – we haven't – we have to look at '18 and consider that. We'll certainly enter 2018 with expectations to continue capturing on the Post side of the business as well as the normal seasonality in the supply trends.
Eric Bolton: Yes, I think where you can get surprise, frankly, Nick, is when you see practices get noticeably more aggressive and given submarkets or markets. And if you happen to have as we do, a fair amount of concentration in a given market or two, it can create a era of conservatism or skepticism about what the future is going to look like versus what you were thinking before. I mean, we think, we're going to – as I've said, I mean, we think we're going to do great on renewal pricing as we have been, as Tom alluded to. I mean, our January renewal notices went out at 7%. We think that the occupancy comparisons start to get a little bit easier, but the new lease pricing got noticeably weaker in July and September. And as a consequence of some pretty aggressive actions that we stalk coming into the market, and we happen to have a lot in Dallas and Austin, as you know. And so that's really the story. There was nothing more to it than that. And the occupancy as it relates to Q3, the occupancy being off last year by 27 basis points was the vast majority of, if you will, the miss in terms of revenue expectations. Of course, we also have some pressure on expenses from the hurricane, the both hurricanes. Now as we start to look forward, we think these practices in Dallas and Austin will be there for a while. So we're going to dilute it into our expectations. We think the expenses get better. We will – we're past hurricane season now, so we'll be back to where we have been running. And that's what caused us to pull our same-store guidance for operating expenses down from what we have before, and it's where we came out.
Nick Yulico: Okay, it's helpful. Just lastly on Atlanta, what is your outlook for that market? I mean, that's one where there's still fair amount of supply delivering numbers having gotten down to the point of Dallas at this point. But how do you think where you are in the supply impact stage for Atlanta and how that market could perform in the coming quarters?
Tom Grimes: I mean, I think, next year, we're encouraged about continued strong growth and job growth and a falloff in – a falloff there and – excuse me, continued strong growth and a falloff on job growth and a falloff on deliveries compounded with just steady improvement on the Post side. I think those things will work in our.
Eric Bolton: When you look at Atlanta next year, I mean, the projections that we have today, which will certainly be updating as we approach forecasting for 2018. But the ratio of job growth in that market to supply deliveries is around 7:1. That's a pretty healthy dynamic. And so we think Atlanta will continue to outperform Dallas next year.
Operator: Thank you. And we can go next to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Tayo Okusanya: First question, when you start to look at 4Q 2017 trends, specifically October trends, anything you're seeing in their that starts to make you feel a little bit better about the supply issue in some of the markets that you highlight in?
Tom Grimes: I think the markets that we're worried about, primarily Dallas and Austin, will continue to be under pressure in the fourth quarter. We think job growth will continue to be good, and we'll just sort of grind it out next year. One encouraging, it – really a same-store level, is from September to October, Post blended rates moved up from one point to – Post blended rates moved up 40 basis points.
Tayo Okusanya: Got you. Okay. And then the second one for Al. Al, I’m still trying to reconcile the kind of guidance, $0.02 increase at the midpoint because the $0.03 benefit from the nonrental – from the derivative income, you’re reversing that out in 4Q. And so the $0.02 increase, if I’m getting this right, is there’s lower same-store NOI growth, but there’s better G&A and better leasing of development. Is that the way I should be thinking about this that kind of all net out?
Al Campbell: I think that’s exactly right, Tayo. Let me just give you how exactly. So we had $0.06 performance in third quarter that carry, let’s push that forward and coming out of that to the $0.02 revision is preferred. We’ve taken $0.02 that that’s going to turn around. I don’t know what’s going to happen, but certainly going to be volatile. Interest rates go up is likely to come back. And then combined same-store vision plus all the other things going on, do take another $0.02 per share. Adding the $0.04, so it gets down to two impact for the full year. And so you are on point exactly what’s happening.
Tayo Okusanya: Gotcha. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we can take our last question from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dennis McGill: Hi, thank you guys. First one, just on the fourth quarter guidance, I guess, the question I would have when you go through and revise based how much is on the third quarter, you’re still up for the fairly wide range and especially for a quarter where there’s not a lot of leasing activity, still to be decided. So can you just maybe explain, kind of thoughts playing that and what would drive results to either end of that spectrum?
Al Campbell: Biggest – I think the biggest thing would be occupancy performance off, that’s – let me – if you think about it, you only have 1 quarter to go. I mean, rental pricing takes more time to really build in. So it would be occupancy and then all the things going on with expenses and other. We feel good about where occupancy is today. We feel like that the exposure is low, as Tom mentioned. So we – our forecast is built on that expectation. It feels like pretty solid, but it can’t change and so we left room for that in 2% to 2.5% in the revenues because things can change. But...
Eric Bolton: One of the challenges with that occupancy variable and forecasting it is that it has a very meaningful impact on a quarter, particularly when you’re talking about 100,000 apartments. A 50 basis point swing or 20 basis point swing on that many units in terms of average data occupancy equates out to a meaningful number. So I think that really rationalizes why we have the range that we do. And it also is the factors that would cause us to be at the upper end or lower end of that range. So a difference on occupancy, no question about it.
Dennis McGill: Okay. Can you just remind me what the percentage of leases that are expiring this quarter would represent?
Tom Grimes: We’re – we intentionally bring lease expirations down, and they range from 5% to 6% a month. So that would be –
Eric Bolton: It’s 15% to 18%.
Tom Grimes: Yes, 15% to 18%.
Eric Bolton: It’s going to be below 20% of the portfolio.
Dennis McGill: Okay, great. And then last question, just, Eric, you had made a comment about the valuations not seeming to – certainly maybe in elevated today and you have a very logical argument about why you would likely see deterioration as you move into next year with all that’s going on with lease-ups and development, and so forth. Why do think the market hasn’t gotten in front of that with respect to valuations today? Why are they not adjusting before that were to happen versus simultaneously?
Eric Bolton: I don’t know, Dennis. I think that – I mean, capital investment capital likes multifamily. I mean, there’s a lot to like there long term, and there’s a lot of good things – as you well know, a lot of good things on the demographics and lifestyle and all those other kind of factors that suggest that multifamily real estate is going to be good. And if you have any kind of multiyear horizon to how you’re willing to think about deploying capital into that kind of demand dynamic, I think people – compared to alternatives in the commercial real estate spectrum, it stacks up pretty darn well. And so I think that’s ultimately what is causing, I think, despite some moderation and leasing fundamentals. Compared to alternatives, multifamily still looks pretty darn good.
Dennis McGill: Okay, great. Appreciated the perspectives. Good luck guys.
Eric Bolton: Thank you, Dennis.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today’s Q&A session. I can turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: No additional comments from us. And we hope to see everyone, November 13th, at our Investor Day in Dallas. And everyone, take care. Thank you.
Al Campbell: Thank you, Savannah.
Operator: You’re very welcome. This does conclude today’s call. Thank you everyone for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a great day.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-07-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the Company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, today, July 27, 2017. I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. Please go ahead, sir.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Lynn. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Rob DelPriore General Council. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, Company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the safe harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call, will be available on our Web site. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and good morning. We were pleased with the solid results for the second quarter with FFO performance ahead of our expectation. Pricing momentum continues to move in a favorable direction and occupancy remains strong. Our portfolio of properties balanced across various sub-markets and price points of the Sunbelt region, combined with our strong operating platform, continues to demonstrate an ability to better tolerate the elevated pockets of new supply present in several markets. The integration of the Post portfolio is making terrific progress. And as expected, the emerging positive trends in higher rents and occupancy are starting to build momentum. The initial opportunities surrounding expense synergies, resulting from our reconciling operating practices and taking advantage of our larger scale, have yielded some early wins on operating expense performance. We expect these trends to continue over the balance for the year into 2018. While, it’s clear the current new supplied trends have caused some moderation from last year’s rent growth results, especially for new moving residence, we continue to believe that at this point in the cycle our legacy MAA portfolio locations continue to offer some offsetting balance or protection against the new supply pressures, which are more evident within the legacy Post of market locations. Our property teams are doing a great job in taking care of our existing residence with renewal lease pricing across the combined adjusted same-store portfolio continuing a solid trend in the 6% range with a steady pattern of improvement and renewal pricing being generated out of the legacy Post portfolio. Resident turnover remains low with 12 month rolling turnover rate at 50.9% halfway through the year, essentially matching last year’s performance of 50.8%. So overall, while leasing conditions have become more competitive when compared to prior year, we continue to believe that a combination of our balanced portfolio, focus on solid employment growth markets of the Sunbelt, coupled with the growing margin expansion opportunities from our merger with Post, will yield continued FFO growth and NOI performance that are in line with our expectation. The transaction market remains highly competitive as investor capital and interest in the multifamily market continues to outpace opportunities being brought to market. As noted in our earnings release, we did not make any acquisitions during the second quarter. However, we continue to underwrite quite a few deals, and we’ll continue to be patient and disciplined in our underwriting as more new development projects are brought to market over the back half of the year. Our lease up and development pipelines are making solid progress. The six new properties currently in lease up were 82.5% occupied at the end of the second quarter, and we expect to stabilize four of these communities in the current third quarter. Our six projects remaining under construction are also making solid progress with additional leasing just getting underway now in Austin at Post Afton Phase II and in Atlanta at Post Millennium Midtown. So in summary, we like the momentum we’re seeing during our peak leasing season and we remain excited with the upside opportunities to capture over the next couple of years from our merger with Post Properties. Our balanced portfolio of properties and strong operating platform continue to demonstrate an ability to deliver stable results through the cycle. Before I turn over the call over to Tom, I do want to express my appreciation to our entire team here at MAA. I appreciate your efforts over the busy summer leasing season, and not only delivering great performance today, but also your extra efforts focused on completing our merger and consolidation activities, which are further strengthening MAA’s platform for the future. And with that, I’ll now turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Grimes: Thank you, Eric and good morning everyone. Progress made since the first quarter is encouraging, and we were especially pleased. We are especially pleased with the improvement in pricing trends emerging from the legacy Post portfolio. For the second quarter, on a lease-over-lease basis, blended rents, which include both new and renewal leases for the combined adjusted same store portfolio grew by 2.6%, an improvement of 130 basis points from the performance in the first quarter. Breaking that down a little bit. Lease-over-lease rents for the new resident lease written during the second quarter were down 70 basis points. This is a significant 250 basis point improvement from the performance in the first quarter. This positive momentum on new lease pricing for the combined adjusted same-store portfolio continued in July with new lease pricing turning positive, now up 30 basis points. Renewal lease pricing within the combined adjusted same store portfolio remained stronger in the second quarter, growing 6.3%. The positive trends are most evident within the legacy Post portfolio as blended rents on lease-over-lease basis improved 150 basis points from the first quarter to the second quarter. The trend continued in July with Post blended lease-over-lease rents growing 2.6%. July’s blended rent performance represents 370 basis points improvement in rents from the first quarter for the legacy Post portfolio. This improvement drove the blended rent growth for the combined adjusted same-store portfolio up to 3.1% in July. The trends are similar for average daily occupancy. In July, the MAA portfolio remained steady at 96.1%, and the post portfolio, which ran 90 basis points behind the legacy MAA portfolio in the second quarter, closed the gap to 50 basis points to 95.6%. 60 day exposure, which is all banking units and notices first 50 day period for both portfolios, is now just 7.4%, very strong for this time of year. We expect the gap between the portfolios, on both rent growth and occupancy, to continue to narrow as the benefits of our operating approach come to bear on the post communities. We’ve completed most of the foundational work associated with repopulating our revenue management system with updated data from the legacy post locations. And they are benefiting from the improved occupancy and exposure positioning. We are pleased with the improvement of this portfolio and our critical busy summer season, and believe that we’ll be positioned as we head into the slower winter months. Expense performance follows a similar pattern. RM costs were down by 2.2%, led by a few early wins in the Post portfolio. As a result of the improved scale, our national accounting pricing improved in both portfolios, but was more impactful in the post results. In addition, the renegotiation of in-market contract services, such as interior paint vendor and pool cleaning services, aided the post results. We have improvements still to come. At the end of the second quarter, the Post communities are still running 25% higher on a maintenance cost per unit basis than the legacy MAA portfolio. We expect this gap to close as our approach to turning units, which is less reliant on expense of contract labor takes hold. Driven by these improvements, in revenue and expense, the NOI margin on the post portfolio increased 130 basis points from the second quarter of last year. While elevated supply levels moderated rent growth, we’re seeing good growth in main markets; Forth Worth, Raleigh, Charleston and Jacksonville stood out from the Group. In both portfolios, Houston remains our only market level worry-bid and represents just 3.7% of our NOI. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. Currently, our combined Huston market’s daily occupancy is 95.3% and 60 day exposure is just 7.9%. Renter demand remained steady and current residents continue to choose to stay with us, move-outs for the portfolio are in line with prior year and turnover remained low at 50.9% on a rolling 12 months basis. Move-outs to home buying and move-outs to home renting remained consistent at 20% and 6% of move-outs. As you know, much of the Post product is in the inter-loop, and is in inter-loop areas that are seeing the most supply. While this puts pressure on the newer product, it creates opportunity on the older product in excellent locations. There’re 13,000 Post units without compelling redevelopment opportunities. We can make these great locations more competitive by updating the product. We have room to raise the rents and still be well below the rates of the new product coming on line. Momentum is building on the Post redevelopment program through genuinely completed 423 units. On average, we’re spending 8,600 and getting the rent increases 13% more than a comparable non-redeveloped unit. For the M&A portfolio, during the quarter, we completed over 2,300 of interior unit upgrades. On legacy MAA, our redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 units to 20,000 units remains robust. On a combined basis, our total redevelopment pipeline is in the neighborhood of 30,000 units. As you can tell from the release, our active lease up communities, are performing well. Leasing has gone better than expected at Charlotte and Midtown and Nashville, and that stabilization date has been moved up a quarter to the fourth quarter of this year. Innovation in Greenville and residents in Fountainhead and Phoenix stabilized on schedule during the quarter. Our four communities scheduled to stabilize in the third quarter are on track to do some. We are actively leasing the [indiscernible], Post South Lamar II and Post [indiscernible] Midtown, and they are progressing well. It has been a busy quarter for our teams and we’re pleased with our progress. The momentum building in the Post portfolio is particularly encouraging. We look forward to continuing to capture value creation opportunities on both revenue and expense sides of the equation. Al?
Al Campbell: Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. I’ll provide some additional commentary on the Company’s second quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally, on guidance for the remainder of the year. Net income available for common shareholders was $0.42 per diluted common share for the quarter. FFO for the quarter was $1.48 per share, which was $0.07 per share above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. The earnings outperformance was primarily related to favorable interest G&A and integration costs during the quarter, with the each producing about $0.02 per share of favorability. And additional $0.01 per share was provided by favorable performance in our lease-up and development properties, which are included in our non-same store portfolio. Our combined adjusted same-store NOI performance was in line with expectations for the quarter. And the integration expense savings were mainly related to timing of cost, which we expect to incur over the remainder of the year. I’ll outline our revised guidance for the full year in just a moment. During the quarter, we completed the construction of two communities, Post Parkside at Wade II located in Raleigh, and Post Afton located in Huston. We’re also beginning the construction of one new community, a Phase II expansion in 1201 Midtown, a community located in Charleston that we acquired late last year. During the second quarter, we funded an additional $50 million of development costs, brining our year-to-date funding to $110 million. Our current development pipeline now contains six projects with the total projected cost of $396 million with only $103 million remaining to the funded. The six projects are expected to produce an average 6.5% stabilized NOI yield once completed and leased up with four of the projects projected to be completed by the first quarter of 2018, and the remaining two completed in the back half of 2018. Just after question end, we sold three wholly-owned communities, located in Lakeland Florida, Montgomery Alabama and Fort Worth, Texas. The total proceeds of $88.4 million represented a strong pricing for 28 year old assets on average and produced 5.3% economic cap rate. We also exited two tertiary markets with these sales. During the second quarter, we successfully used our enhanced credit ratings to complete a bond offering. We see $600 million of 3.6% unsecured 10 year notes an issue price of 99.58%, using the proceeds to pay down our line of credit. Therefore, we also prepaid $156 million of secured mortgages, further increasing our unencumbered assets to 83% of our total gross assets. For our bond covenants at quarter end, our leverage to bond as debt to total assets, was 34% and our consolidated net income, our consolidated income, covered our debt services of 5.2 times. We also had over $877 million of combined cash capacity on our credit facility to provide protection and support for our business plans. Finally, we increased our earnings guidance for the full year to reflect the second quarter performance and updated expectations for the remainder of the year. We are updating guidance for net income per diluted common share, which is reconciled to update FFO and AFFO guidance from the supplement. Net income per diluted common share is now projected to be $2.69 to $2.89 for the full year of 2017. FFO is now projected to be $5.77 to $5.99 -- $5.97 per share or $5.87 at the mid-point, which includes $0.15 per share of merger and integration costs for the full year. AFFO is projected to be $5.18 to $5.38 per share, or $5.28 at the mid-point. We’re maintaining our guidance expectations for the combined adjusted same-store portfolio, which is expected to produce NOI growth for the full year in 3% to 3.5% range. Since summer, we are increasing our FFO guidance for the full year by $0.03 per share, representing the additions from Q2 performance discussed earlier, partially offset by the $0.02 per share of integrations costs now expected to be incurred later in the year, along with an additional reduction of $0.02 per share related to provide the acquisition timing and yields for the year. And given the competitive environment, Eric mentioned earlier, we now expect our remaining acquisition opportunities to occur later in the year in all to be lease up communities. Our guidance for acquisition volume and total merger and integration expenses for the full year remains unchanged. We did increase our range for disposition volume as our actual pricing expectation is exceeding our initial estimates. We also narrowed the range of expected G&A costs and development investment for the full year. We remain on track to capture the full $20 million of overhead synergies related to the Post merger on run rate basis by year end. And we also expect to continue capturing additional NOI opportunities, including our forecast, primarily in the later part of this year as operating practices and platforms become fully integrated. That’s all that we have in the way of prepared comments, Lynn. So now, I’ll turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go ahead and take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Nick Joseph: Just in terms of same-store revenue guidance, I know you maintained it. So it looks like you’re assuming acceleration of growth into the back half of the year at about 3.5% versus the 2.5% you did in the first half. So I am wondering if you can give the components of that in terms of occupancy assumptions, rate growth assumptions and the other revenue that makes you comfortable with that acceleration.
Al Campbell: Nick, this is Al. I’ll tell you, if you remember we talked about in Q1 that what we needed to see for the rest of the year for our revenue guidance, it was to see renewals continue to be very strong about 6%, which we definitely saw in the second quarter, about 6.3% on average. And we needed to see that new lease pricing, which was down little longer than we expected in Q1 and continue to see those positive trends that we began to see in April. And we did see that in May, June and I think Tom mentioned July, and a very strong -- renewals were strong over 6% and new leases moved to positive territory, lending to about 3.1%. So that’s all the positive change that we needed to see in terms of the back half. We need to continue to see that blended rent in the below the 3% range. We expect to see that from a couple of reasons; one, the MAA portfolio is very stable, very strong; we expect it to have some seasonality as we move through the back of the year; but hold strong in terms of renewals and new lease pricing; then, we expect to continue to capture some of the opportunities in revenue on the Post side really supporting that further. And so the combination of those two gives us really firm support for our belief in the revenue guidance that we’ve got. I would tell you, we expect it to grow as we go through the year. I think our expectations for Q3 are 2.5% to 3% range-ish and Q4 are 3% to 3.5% as we continue to capture those synergies that we talked about.
Eric Bolton: And Nick, this is Eric. I would also add though that we also feel very confident in the expense guidance that we have out there as we talked about. We’ve seen some real opportunities emerging on that side of the equation. And as a consequence of that, we feel very confident where our NOI is likely to come out this year relative to expectation.
Al Campbell: Let me just add a point on that too, Nick. I am sure you could do the math on that. So to Eric’s point, NOI is where we are year-to-date and what we expected here. We expect to be well into the range on that, expenses are coming on fast and we’re having a really good performance in that, as Tom mentioned. So that likely will come at first lower end of the range. And the revenue likely as well, given the first half year results and the projections I just talked to you, will probably be lower end of range as well, supporting well into range on NOI.
Nick Joseph: And then just in terms of the performance of large markets versus secondary markets. It looks like the secondary markets actually outperformed in the quarter. In terms of the trend, do you expect to continue or was that something unique to this quarter?
Eric Bolton: I think that the trend will continue, at this point in the large markets, it's a supply issue. And the opportunities in the Post portfolio will add over time as revenue builds. So I think this is a place where I think those performances will -- that gap will narrow overtime as we get the Post revenue process rolling along.
Al Campbell: I would tell you, Nick, that I think that absent the opportunity embedded within the Post portfolio, the delta between the large and the secondary markets are probably continue to play out as if we saw in Q2 for a while, given the supply dynamics that are going on with these larger markets having more supply. But the operating opportunity upside in the Post portfolio is going to really, we think, become increasingly evident in our results over the next several quarters. And likely, will offset some of that supply pressure to the point that we may see large markets resume outperformance in the secondary markets a little quicker than regular supply dynamics would support.
Eric Bolton: Nick may be a good example of that would be in our DC market. That is a place where folks are arguing between whether it’s a bad market or a mediocre market. But our Post blended rents for that market for the second quarter were up 4.6% and we feel good about the opportunities that we see in this Post portfolio.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take our next question from Drew Babin with Robert. W. Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Drew Babin: Talking about the increased disposition guidance resulting from pricing, and not necessarily higher volume of assets sold. The 5.3% economic cap rate on the July sales was surprise. And I guess if you could give a sense of, or give us a sense of what remaining dispositions for this year might look like in terms of being in MAA legacy or post legacy asset or just some color on the timing as well.
Eric Bolton: By definition to some degree is the surprise given that was above our range. But we knew that the pricing would be good, just frankly turned out to be a little bit better than we expected. We do have two other dispositions that we have planned for this year, both around the contract, both our legacy MAA locations, both are in the Atlanta market. And we should have those closed sometime in the fourth quarter.
Tim Argo: And our revised expectations are included in our revised guidance.
Drew Babin: And on the acquisition side, obviously, the acquisition guide has been changed despite just not a lot of activity so far this year. Is that -- I guess what gives you confidence that that number is a possibility in the second half of the year? Is there anything specific you’re seeing, or is it just a wait and see type of approach to see what comes to market?
Eric Bolton: Look, two things, one is that, we do think that the deals being brought to market are more likely to get to grow as opposed to shrink as more supply continues to come on line. So we just think that there will be more opportunities coming into the market. And secondly, historically, for the last several years, we’ve always had more success in making acquisitions in the back half of the year as compared with the first half of the year. We just find developers and sellers are little bit more motivated as we approach year end. And so we, for those two reasons, we’re hopeful that we will continue to be able to capture opportunity in the range that we’ve given.
Drew Babin: And then one quick one on DC. I mean acknowledging, it's not -- that works for markets for MAA, it looks like it's worth asking. Clearly, it sounds like you’re not tremendously worried about DC as a market. Can you just talk about the positioning of legacy post assets around DC exposure the sense rather than healthcare, different dynamics within Washington that might help and/or cover that portfolio relative to the market?
Eric Bolton: I would tell you much like our portfolio spread throughout the Sunbelt that portfolio in DC is spread throughout. So there is a little bit -- there is some Northern Virginia exposure, there is Alexandria exposure. We’re right there of the river and Pentagon City that has some, obviously, some military exposure to it. And there is a little bit in Maryland. So frankly, it spread across the group. The one consistent opportunity though is that one I think is pricing or two consistent opportunities that we see are pricing practices and redevelopment in those areas. And that’s honestly where our optimism about DC comes as we see opportunities operate differently. And that gives us an outside of the market growth opportunity.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Market. Please go ahead, your line is open.
John Kim: On the deceleration of same store revenue growth this quarter, despite the slight pickup in occupancy. Can you just remind us, is this entirely due to rates or do you also offer incentives currently?
Al Campbell: And talking about the decline in revenue from Q1 to Q2, it really bodes down to the pricing -- new lease pricing that we had in Q1. If you remember, we talked about the fact that new lease pricing is typically negative with the first part of the year. But our experience in Q1 was it stayed negative for the quarter long that we expected. Good news was as we moved in April we saw that trend change and move in a positive direction. But that impact of Q1 really does leases fully rolled into our portfolio in Q2. And so that’s when we felt the most impact from that period of time. And in fact, we expected Q2 to be our lowest revenue quarter for the year that was when the big surprise for us. But we also knew that the trends that we expect for the rest had begun in April. We saw that in May, June and even July continue. And so it impacted Q2 the most. We feel good about momentum in the portfolio going into the back part of the year.
John Kim: Okay, so no incentives on renewals?
Eric Bolton: The effective 2.4% of rent growth includes the impact…
Tom Grimes: We’re a net rent shop, so can say, every number that we give you on the rent, lease-over-lease or ERU or effective rent per unit is all -- has all concessions in that number.
John Kim: And then out of your large markets, there’s been a few of them where you had a significant drop of over 100 basis points, sequentially, so that includes Austin, Charlotte, DC, Nashville, Phoenix. Are there any of those markets that surprised you this quarter?
Tom Grimes: I think, frankly, it works as we expected. We are seeing pressure in those areas. We’re still optimistic, I think, Charlotte is a different story than what’s a Austin and it’s more bifurcated between the Downtown pressure where the suburban assets are doing a bit better. But not much on the large market side surprises us, John.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Rob Stevenson: Tom, you said that the legacy Post portfolio closed some of the NOI margin differential during the quarter. What is the NOI margin differential right now as we sit here today between Post and MAA legacy portfolios?
Tom Grimes: We’ll grab that. But at the initial, it was 100 basis points and we’ve closed -- I mean, we frankly exceeded that two quarters in a row with improvement of 130 basis points on Post each quarter.
Al Campbell: And at this point, Rob, we’d effectively brought the Post portfolio on top of it, slightly ahead of the MAA legacy portfolio. And as you remember, we talked about that over time over the first 12 to 18 months we expected that Post portfolio to actually exceed maybe 100 to 150 basis points because it well should given the rent structure of that portfolio. So we’re well, call it halfway there and we feel very good about that.
Tom Grimes: Pretty excited about that progress, Rob.
Rob Stevenson: What is the timeframe you think to get that extra, the other half done? Is that end of year or is that into ‘18?
Tom Grimes: I think that’s later in’18, Rob. I mean what happens when you can get in and move the expense side down, we saw quick early wins there and jumped on that immediately. The pricing trends we love, but that’s pricing trends on a month or a quarter and it just takes some time for all that to come down through. So we’re doing great on expenses and we’re right where we would expect to be on revenues on post portfolio that just takes longer.
Rob Stevenson: Al is there any material difference between where the legacy Post portfolio is now and where the MAA portfolio is on a real estate tax rate basis on asses values and everything else relative to what you guys think is reasonable?
Al Campbell: No, I think there is totally -- there is a different product type and even location in those two portfolios on average. So I think that’s built-in. And I think there’s not tremendous difference right now, Rob. I think the opportunity on the real estate tax side is not a situation we go and can change valuations very quickly. It’s going to take time where our approach was a constant downward pressure and we think overtime that bought better results for us. I think what we’ll see on the Post side of the business is maybe that constant downward pressure result in improvements over the next few years. But right now, on a relative basis not a significant difference than what we’ve felt.
Rob Stevenson: Eric, what was behind the sale of the land parcels during the quarter? What they does -- you mentioned you want to go forward yourself on those?
Eric Bolton: They all vary, some just in -- we just didn’t feel like those were size fit that would make sense for us to build out. And some of it is still some legacy, so if we picked up from Colonial. But largely, these are out parcels that for a host of reasons, we just don’t feel like make sense for us to develop.
Rob Stevenson: How should we be taking about development, going forward? I mean, you inherited the bulk of the current pipeline is stuff you inherited from Post. When you fast forward into early ’18, the current pipeline is going to fall by 75%, you’re going to be left with not that much left in progress with the 2018, the two lateral half ‘18 deliveries. How are you thinking about backfilling or you’re going to be running at about $100 million of development? How should we be thinking about that, going forward?
Eric Bolton: We would like to and we are actively working to find opportunities to start to repopulate that pipeline with projects. And David Ward and his guys are out looking at a number of opportunities right now. We’ve got a couple of parcels of land that we do own that we do feel like will make sense to develop on, one in North Dallas. In particular, I’m thinking about, there is an opportunity that we are actively working on in Raleigh, another opportunity we’re looking at in Denver. And so we do believe that over the course for the next six months, we will start to begin to slowly repopulate that pipeline. Looking at deliveries that would then probably come online in early -- mid-year 2019 is what we’re working on at this point. But we intend to have something approaching no more than 3% to 4% of enterprise value, I mean, which is kind of where we are right now, really at about 3% of enterprise value. In terms of the development exposure, as you point out, that’s going to dwindle down next year. But we hope to get it back in 2019 and beyond.
Rob Stevenson: The project that you were just talk about, are those Post -- Mid-America Post development assets, or are these assets if you guys are likely to do with some merchant developer, like MAA used to do in the past?
Eric Bolton: No, these would be really depend -- I mean, a couple of them are where we would be the developer. And we are having conversations with several folks right now along the lines of what we’ve done in the past where it’s a pre-purchase of something with the merchant builder or pre-purchase to something they’re going to build. Those things get complicated sometimes in the negotiations in terms of lease-up and so forth. But we will be pursuing both where we will be the developer, we will not be the general contractor ever, but we would be the developer. And we’re also looking at some pre-purchase of things to be built.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take our next question from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open. Mr. Anderson, please shut the mute function on your telephone.
Rich Anderson: So Eric, lot of momentum and a good story about integrating Post into your system and all the margin improvements and all that. I’m curious how much is Post come into the rescue in terms of your perspective of the fundamental picture for multi-family, if not for merging the two companies. How much more negative would you feel about your prospects and maybe how would be operating differently with your legacy MAA portfolio in hand?
Eric Bolton: We’d be fine. I mean we were absolutely fine with our legacy MAA structure and balance sheet. I mean what Post brought, frankly, was an opportunity to be a little stronger in different part of the cycle than what legacy MAA would be on its own. And brought, as I’ve mentioned in the past, also another mechanism, another avenue of opportunity for us to grow externally and deploy capital through development. But this is a part of the cycle where the legacy MAA assets on a combined basis tend to hold up a little bit better as demonstrated by the fact the secondary market group outperformed the large market group in the quarter. So we don’t view Post, the addition of the Post assets, is coming to the rescue at all. We view that as addition to post assets as an add-on to what was already a pretty strong full stock performance profile that’s only gotten stronger as a consequence of adding assets and locations that will give us more exposure, better performance doing in different part of the cycle.
Rich Anderson: And then just unrelated follow up question. You’ve been -- component of the S&P 500 now for several months. I’m curious if you’ve been having any different conversations with non-dedicated REIT investors, and if you can comment at all on a different perspective from maybe a changing investor base? If the answer is no, then this is simple answer. But if is there anything there that you can communicate as getting a different class of investors into your stock?
Eric Bolton: Well, I think that there has been another simple change, Rich, in two ways; one, we just see a lot more people that we used to see, having these meetings and whether it’s NAREIT or any of these other conferences that we attend; property tours have really picked up. And so we’re seeing a lot more people, different groups of people that we’ve seen in the past. And secondly, we’ve always believed that our strategy and our approach in the way we think about creating value over the long haul has a strong appeal to the generalist investor, if you will. And so the opportunities that we have to tell our story and to talk about the track record and the philosophies that we bring to the multi-family RIET space, I think, it continues to resonate pretty well with this group. And so we’re excited about the positive impact long-term and we think from being exposed to this more generalist crowd.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Just wanted to touch on seasonality a bit, and how you guys are thinking about that as we enter the back half of the year. When do you start to see the impact to new lease rates and seasonality? And should we expect something different within the post portfolio versus legacy MAA? I guess, just given some of the operational upside that you’re starting to see.
Al Campbell: I think what’s built into our expectations of back half of the year is largely MAA portfolio continue to stay pretty stable with a slight seasonality as we expect. But remember through from April through June, July, the MAA portfolio was 3.3%, 3.5% in lender rent growth, so very stable. And we expect it to stay stable, maybe moderating a little bit. But then support coming from continued capture of the post synergies in the back half. So I think we expect revenue to be in third quarter to be higher in the second quarter, and then fourth higher than the third, and so the continued trend in that. The one seasonal item that I will bring out that I would remind people of that will make, if you don’t remember, it may look unusual. Last year, Post had a very significant reduction in real estate taxes in the third quarter, a 10% reduction as every quarter and adjustment in that quarter. So one thing we’ll see moving to third quarter is our expenses. I think they’ll still be around -- they’ll still be not outsized significantly but that would impact that. I think our NOI for the third quarter will be slightly impacted that, maybe the lowest for the year I think coming back in the fourth quarter being the strongest in the year. And so those are the general trends that we expect.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then on the Post side. Was there any occupancy opportunity late in the year that you could talk about, and what’s the potential upside there? I think more towards the fourth quarter.
Tom Grimes: I think there is probably 10 to 20 basis points in the fourth quarter, in the third quarter, both portfolios had really strong years last year. And so that will be a difficult comp.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then just on the expense side, it sounds like you’re confident that you’ll be within the lower end of that range of the guidance you’ve laid out for the year. I mean is this savings that you’ve already outlined and you’re just seeing it earlier? Or is it on top of what you anticipated when you underwrote the portfolio?
Eric Bolton: Probably Tom and I can tack in this. But it's primarily coming from quicker capture of the Post opportunity. We had lined out both revenue and expense synergy opportunities and we had about $4 million to $5 million that we capture in 2017 with the other $10 million or so, $8 million to $10 million capture in 2018. And what we laid out initially was probably two-thirds will come from revenue and one-third comes in expense in 2017. I think we’ll probably see that flip-flop. We probably see two-thirds come from expense as we really had good opportunity on that early and one-third from revenue this year with the revenue opportunity over the full period being actually there may be little more, and some of that will come in ’18.
Tom Grimes: I think that’s a fair assessment.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take our next question from John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead, your line is open.
John Guinee: I haven’t been on the call before. Hi Eric, it's been a long time. Question for you, what I’ve noticed in all these supplemental from the apartment world is nothing on average unit size, nothing on per square foot of rental income, per square foot in terms of development costs. When you guys are talking internally, are you relying as much on per unit or per square foot numbers? How do you think about that?
Eric Bolton: We generally think about -- when we’re talking about development costs, we generally think about in terms of per unit. When we think about rents, it’s a combination of -- it depends on the nature of the conversation we have. We do think a lot about per square foot rent levels out in the market and do some comparisons like that. But it, on balance, I would tell you whether we’re modeling on development or thinking about competitive position in the given market, on rents to see on per square foot basis. And then we’re talking about acquisition costs, development costs, as we think about on a per unit basis.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Neil Malkin: First question, I know, the Post portfolio be included in the same store [bridge] results. If you go back a couple of quarters, looks like more of a market deceleration probably was actually happening. I was wondering if you could give us some perspective on. What is it looks like on the ground in your bigger market Atlanta, Dallas, Charlotte, Tampa? Can you just talk about what’s going out in terms of supply and demand, particularly, because you have an elevated suburban exposure? I was wondering if you’re seeing impact from supply hit all areas.
Eric Bolton: It is not equal as you mentioned, and now just a few of them. At Atlanta, good job growth at 2.6%, but the bulk of the supply is really concentrated in that bucket P3 Road area, so in our loop and that’s affecting those Post assets. The 85 Corridor or 75 Corridor, those are all -- seen much less in the way of supply. I think completions in Atlanta will have about 8,600 that will drop next year to 6,500. And then you mentioned Charlotte and it’s for sure a tougher uptown, downtown picture with rent growth in the suburbs closer to 4%, and it’s flat in the downtown area. And then Dallas is probably the market where we would expect to see more supply coming up next year, maybe about 2,000 units or so. And it’s a little more wide-spread. It is focused in that Downtown corridor and then runs up a bit to point down to Frisco and [44.21] a bit.
Neil Malkin: And then I guess and there is follow-up in different way. In your market job growth is very strong wages is very strong, the rent continued to slow down. I mean, is the Post portfolio having an outside impact on the pace of revenue growth or rent growth? Or what do you think is driving those phenomena just given the strength on what you could think would be the demand side and ability to pay?
Eric Bolton: Post is a current drag on revenues, frankly. And that’s why we’re so excited and you see the differential between the numbers that I mentioned earlier, the 350 basis point improvement on rents from the first quarter to July. We feel like that is non-market related and we’ve got the opportunity to push outside of that. But Post assets baked in pricing materially slowed our large market group and our overall revenues. And we are quickly, I think, unlocking the value pushing new lease rates up, pushing renewal rates up, which translates into blended rent increases that just takes time to compound and drive revenues up.
Neil Malkin: And then last from me, you talked about looking at project in Denver. Is that a market you want to build exposure to?
Tom Grimes: At this point, yes, it is. I mean we’ve been studying that market for quite some time. As I think you may recall, Post had a development there that we’re already committed to. There’s another site that we have under contract, the post had on contract that we like very much. And so the short answer is, yes, that’s the market that we expect to grow in.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take our next question from Conor Wagner with Green Street. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Conor Wagner: On the redevelopment program, you mentioned the legacy MAA versus Post. But obviously, a lot of that is Colonial. Can you give us an update on how that’s gone and what’s left for you within Colonial to redevelop?
Tom Grimes: Of that pipeline that I mentioned on the legacy MAA portfolio of roughly 15,000 units, that is primarily the Colonial pipeline that we’re winding down. So we’ve still got room to run in that area.
Conor Wagner: And then Tom, if you could tell us a little bit more about DC. What you outlined on the Post assets is obviously positive. But you had a sequential occupancy drop, and as you mentioned, people think it's either bad or mediocre. Outside of the opportunity you have to just improve the Post assets, what are you seeing in the market broadly in terms of demand trends?
Tom Grimes: We are paying a little bit more for our demand with increased search cost. So I would say, it is moderately harder to get people through the door, but certainly not impossible. And honestly, Conor, I hadn’t spent a ton of time really understanding that because the controllable easy opportunities are right in front of us and we’re kind of focused on that. I’m not willing to become the stage of the DC market, just yet. But we feel good about our opportunities there.
Conor Wagner: And then finally on the move out to home purchase, you mentioned 20% overall for the portfolio. Is there any difference there in terms of just -- we know the overall number will be different between Post and legacy MAA. But is there any difference in the trend there in terms of a pick-up in move out to buy activity on legacy Post?
Tom Grimes: They are right on top of each other, Conor, maybe a 100 bps lower on the Post portfolio, right now.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take our next question from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Buck Horne: Just thinking about the development pipeline a little bit. Have you guys noticed any trends in construction labor availability and/or materials pricing, things like lumber, concrete, otherwise that obviously those factors going up. Is that affecting development starts in your areas? Are you seeing any signs that one or other inputs going into construction are easing, or making it more difficult to get starts underway?
Eric Bolton: Buck, I would tell you that we haven’t seen anything that would suggest developments getting easier. I think all signs continue suggest that if anything, it's harder. You mentioned construction costs associated materials and labor. Labor, in particular, I think is the area that is continuing to become increasingly problematic for developers. But what we continue to hear also is just that securing financing continues to be a challenge. It’s available but certainly more expensive than it used to be, and the loan proceeds that one can achieve, is not as great as it used to be is what we consistently hear. So as I mentioned, we are out looking at a number of opportunities and modeling a lot but as it is on the acquisition side, development is hard to pencil right now on a basis that certainly for near term deliveries that makes any sense. So I think that, on balance, I think the pressures are higher to support development today than they were a year ago.
Buck Horne: And I do want to follow-up a little bit on the comment about Denver. Going back into that market or adding to that market from what Post had. Is that something where -- is that a market where you do feel like you could internally develop enough property to get to scale? Or would you feel like you need to make a more portfolio level acquisition to build up an efficient operation there?
Eric Bolton: Well, we think through is a combination of both acquiring existing stabilized assets acquiring current lease up properties or to be built properties plus what we could do on the development side that that’s the market that offers enough opportunity that we could get to scale that make sense for us there. We’re going to be patient with it. It's not something we feel like we have to accomplish in the next year. So we’re going to be very, very consistent in our underwriting and our approach to thinking about how we grow our presence there. We do like the dynamics of that market long-term. I think it does add some diversification to our portfolio that creates some benefits and so -- but we’re going to be patient with it. But whether it's buying or building, we think the market will yield enough opportunities to make it worth our effort.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take our next question from Hardik Goel wijh Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Hardik Goel: Just had a quick question on the Post portfolio specifically and what’s your guide is -- new lease growth was there for the first quarter and the second quarter?
Eric Bolton: For the second quarter for Post, did you say new?
Hardik Goel: New…
Tom Grimes: It was down 4%. And I don’t have the first quarter handy, but I think it was probably 200 bps, or so…
Al Campbell: Yes, and been down about 7% in Q1.
Hardik Goel: And I am guessing that’s part of where all the upside to the revenue guidance in the back half of year is going to come from. Where do you see that really ending the year?
Al Campbell: I think what we’ve seen so far is the first part of the year was where the spread was really large that talked about the Q1 was the big, the new leases are down. And what we saw was just on blended proposed, I mean, just blend from there I think is a best way to think about it. We were below one blended negative one for three, almost four months in a row through April but they only moved into May and we went positive 0.7, positive 1.3 in June and move to July, positive 2.6. So that’s a very good trend and that’s where the momentum we’re talking about building. It definitely has been a drag on MAA’s performance but the momentum and the positive aspects of what we’re doing and proxy forms is definitely kicking in, and now we expect it to drive some performance in the second half.
Operator: Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the program back over to Mr. Argo.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Lynn. We have no further comments and just want to [indiscernible] if anybody has any further questions. Thanks.
Operator: This does conclude today’s program. You may disconnect your line at any time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-04-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, April 27, 2017. I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. Please go ahead, sir.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Jessica. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I would like to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the safe harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. FFO results for the quarter were ahead of our expectations as property operating expenses, interest expense and merger and integration costs all came in lower than expected. While leasing conditions across most markets reflect varying degrees of moderation as a result of increased levels of new supply, we continue to see strong demand across our markets with high resident retention and MAA’s balanced portfolio continues to capture solid results. We also terrific start with integration activities in our merger with Post Properties. The early results and improved operating efficiency and NOI margin enhancement are very encouraging. In the first quarter, our operating team was able to improve the NOI margin within the Legacy Post same-store portfolio 130 basis points as compared to prior year. Our initial efforts on the revenue side were focused on stabilizing occupancy, lowering exposure and reconciling practices associated with lease renewal pricing. During the quarter, our Asset Management Group was also completed the retooling of key market data within our revenue management system associated with each of the Legacy Post Properties. And as a result, we had into peak leasing season well positioned to optimize on pricing performance. Our operating teams have also captured some early wins on the expense side equation with renegotiated pricing and new contracts. We have much more left to accomplish and opportunity to harvest, but we’re certainly encouraged with early trends and the longer term opportunities to be captured in our merger with Post. Our unit interior redevelopment program had a record first quarter performance with over 1,500 units redeveloped significant rent bumps and attractive long-term prospects that Tom will outline in his comments. During the first quarter, substantial work was completed in initially scoping out this effort at a number of the legacy Post Properties and, as Tom will outline, the early indications are very promising. We expect to see this activity ramp up quite a bit at the legacy Post locations over the course of this year and throughout 2018. Al will walk you through our update of FFO guidance, but we’re encouraged with the start to the year. And while we did make some offsetting adjustments to same store revenue and expense performance assumptions, we continue to be comfortable with our initial guidance for same-store NOI or said another way, we are reaffirming our original same store NOI guidance of 3% to 3.5% growth over the prior year. With continued steady employment trends coupled with MAA’s diversified and balanced portfolio approach, and with the upside we expect the capture from enhanced operating efficiencies and margin improvement especially within the legacy Post portfolio, we are optimistic about our ability to drive NOI results as outlined in our guidance for the balance of the year. Good progress continues with our lease-up and new development pipelines and we look forward to getting those properties fully earnings productive over the next several quarters. As noted in our earnings release, we did make one acquisition during the quarter. It’s an opportunity very much in line with the investments that we’ve captured over the past couple of years, which was a newly developed property in its initial lease-up that had fallen out of contract earlier. The transaction market and pricing continues to be competitive as we’ve seen over the past couple of years and we will continue to be patient and disciplined in navigating through the pipeline of opportunities being presented. We are off to a great start for the year, and I appreciate the great results are being generated by our MAA associates as we deliver today, while also building for tomorrow. That’s all I have in my prepared comments. I will now turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Grimes: Thanks, Eric, and good morning to everyone. Our first quarter same store NOI performance of 3.6 was driven by revenue growth of 2.8% over the prior year and strong expense control. The top line was driven by rent growth as all in place effective rents increased 2.9% from the prior year. All leases signed during the quarter were up of 1.3%. But we’ve seen some persistent weakness through the first quarter on new lease pricing. So let’s just jump into that area first. For the same store portfolio, new lease rates on a lease-over-lease basis were down 3.2% for the quarter. As expected, the submarkets incurring higher levels of supply bore the brunt of the pressure on capturing new residents during the slower winter months. We expect new lease pricing will remain challenged in a number of locations over the first -- over the next few quarters, as the new supply pipeline fully delivers. But we expect to see some improvement, as we move into the more favorable leasing season. Encouragingly, leasing velocity has picked up and new lease pricing has improved by 190 basis points from April month-to-date as compared to the first quarter. In addition, as Eric touched on, we’ve completed most of the foundational work associated with repopulating our revenue management system with updated data from the legacy Post locations and with improved occupancy and exposure positioning. We are where we should be heading into the summer. Renewals for the combined portfolio were still strong for the quarter at 6.1%. Renewal signed for MAA remained robust at 6.6%. Post renewal rates responded well under the MAA pricing approach. In January, they were up 4%; in February, 4.7%; March they increased to 5.4%; and so far in April, they’re coming in at 5.7%. For perspective, renewals sign on the Post assets for April last year were up 4.8%. As a result, blended rents have improved 120 basis points from 1.3% in the first quarter to 2.5% April month-to-date. Occupancy exposure trends are strong across the board. April month-to-date average daily physical occupancy of 96% matches our very strong April of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for 60-day period is just 7.9%, which is better than last year. The strength in this area gives us a solid foundation as we had into the busier season. On the market front, revenues in Phoenix, Raleigh, National and Jacksonville stood out from the group. In addition, it’s worth noting the effective rent growth coming from markets like Charleston, Richmond and Memphis were all above 4%. In both portfolios, Houston remains our only market level worry bead and represents just 3.5% of our NOI. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. Currently, our combined Houston markets daily occupancy is 96.2% and 60-day exposure is just 7.6%. Expense performance was solid led by few early wins in the Post portfolio. As a result of the improved scale, our national account pricing improved in both portfolios, but it was more impactful in the Post results. In addition, the renegotiation of end market contract services such as interior paint vendor improved cleaning and services aided the Post results. The increased sale also improved the pricing of our casualty insurance. Driven by this expense performance, the NOI margin on the Post portfolio increased 130 basis points from the quarter, from the first quarter of last year. Rental demand remains steady and our current residents continue to choose to stay with us. Move-outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 2.2% over the prior year and turnover dropped again to a low 15.5% on a rolling 12-month basis. Move-outs to home buying and move-outs to home renting remain consistent at 20% and 6% of move-outs. As you know, much of the Post product is in interloop areas that are seeing the most supply. While this puts pressure on the newer product and creates opportunity on the well located older product. There are 13,000 Post units that are in very good interloop locations that have compelling redevelopment opportunities. We can make these great locations more competitive by updating the product. We have room to, we will have room to raise rents and still be well below the rates of the new product coming online. The early response to the Post redevelopment is impressive. At this point in our redevelopment, units are pre-leasing based only on the description of the units provided by our onsite teams or mostly on the description based by our onsite teams. Through April month-to-date, we have completed 80 units, but we’ve already leased 152 units on the Post communities. Given the quality of the locations, the redevelopment opportunities more significant. On average, we’re spending $8,600 and getting a rent increase that is 10% more on comparable and non-redeveloped units. As Eric mentioned, we’re just getting started. We originally plan on doing 1,700 units in the Post portfolio. However, if the response to the product remains strong through our busier season, we all have the opportunity to exceed this amount. For the full MAA portfolio during the quarter, we completed over 1,500 interior unit upgrades on legacy MAA. Our redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remains robust and on a combined basis, our total redevelopment pipeline is in the neighborhood of 30,000 units. As you can tell from the release, our active lease-up communities are performing well. We moved the stabilization date for innovation, 1201 Midtown in Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes Phase II up a quarter and moved Post Parkside at Wade back a quarter. These timing differences are minimal and do not have an impact on our return assumptions. Our new acquisition community in Nashville is on track and residents in Fountainhead in Phoenix and Innovation in Greenville will stabilize on schedule in the second quarter. We’re pleased with our progress thus far in the Post merger and remain confident in the opportunities ahead to create value by continuing to reconcile practices between these two companies. Al?
Al Campbell: Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. I’ll provide some additional commentary on company’s first quarter earnings performance, the balance sheet activity and then finally on guidance for the remainder of 2017. Net income available for common shareholders were $0.36 per diluted common share for the quarter. FFO for the quarter was $1.46 per share, which was $0.08 per share about the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. We were encouraged by the solid first quarter performance but the results included some noise related to the nature and timing of several items, which should be considered in the revised expectations for remainder in the year. I’ll provide a little more color in a moment. But in summary, $0.03 per share is related to favorable operating performance for the quarter, same store, non-same store combined. An additional $0.03 per share is related to lower-than-expected integration and the interest cost combined for the quarter. And, finally, the quarter included $0.02 per share of non-cash income related to a required mark-to-market adjustments of an embedded derivatives. About two thirds of the favorable operating performance of $0.02 per share was related to the combined adjusted same store portfolio, primarily due to operating expense performance. With the remaining penny per share related to the non-same store portfolio as lease-up development and commercial properties outperformed a little bit better than expected for the quarter. As mentioned, integration and interest cost together produced another $0.03 per share of favorability for the quarter, a portion of which is timing related. We remain confident in our full year projection ranges for each of these items. And then, finally, the first quarter results include the $0.02 per share of non-cash income from the embedded derivative related to the preferred shares acquired in the Post merger. In short, accounting rules required that we bifurcate and assumed embedded derivative related to the call options on the shares. The derivative must be recorded as an asset and mark-to-market each period through earnings. While also trading during the first quarter produced a sizable non-cash adjustment, which compares no real economic benefit and will potentially reverse at some point over the remainder of the year. And I will outline our revised guidance for the remainder of the year in just a moment. During the first quarter, we acquired a new developed committee located in Nashville for $62.5 million, which was in lease-up when acquired and about 77% occupied at quarter end. We also funded an additional $62.5 million of development cost during the quarter. We completed the construction of two development committee slightly ahead of schedule during the quarter, leading seven communities in our current development pipeline with an expected total cost of just over $505 million, of which all but the $129 million is already have been fund. During the quarter, Moody’s Investors Services upgraded our investment-grade rating to Baa1 and stable, which reflects the strength of our balance sheet and brings all of our ratings, Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch to the third level investment grade. We expect to use these ratings this year as we plan to access the bond markets refinance maturities and to pay down our credit line. At quarter end, our leverage to bond and debt-to-total assets for our public bond covenants was 31.4% and encumbered assets were over 80% of gross assets. We also had over $460 million of combined cash and capacity under our credit facility to provide protection and support for our business plans. And finally, we revised our earnings guidance for the full year to reflect the first quarter performance and update expectations for the remainder of the year. We’re updating guidance for net income per diluted common share which is reconcile to updated FFO and AFFO guidance in the supplement. Net income per diluted common share is now projected to be 254, 274 for the full year 2017, reflected update expectation of gains on planned disposition properties. FFO is now projected to be 574 to 594 per share or 584 at the midpoint, which includes $0.15 per share of merger and integration cost for the full year. AFFO is projected to be 515 to 534 per share or 525 at the midpoint. We are maintaining our overall expectation for combined adjusted same store NOI growth for the year in the 3% to 3.5% range. We now expect this to be produced by revenue growth in the 3.2% range and expense growth in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. In summary, we are increasing our FFO guidance for the full year by $0.02 per share. This is produced by the strong Q1 performance at 8%, $0.08 per share performance above our guidance as mentioned earlier. Combined with revised expectations for several items which offset $0.06 of this favorable performance remainder of the year. First we expect volatility from the derivative accounting to reverse the $0.02 of non-cash income of the remainder year. Also we now expect our acquisitions to be a little later in the year and to provide more lease-up opportunities, which cost an additional $0.02 per share and initial 2017 but we expect to be more accretive and value productive over the longer term. In addition, revised guidance for real estate taxes, now expected to grow 5.5% to 6.5% renew per share over the remainder of the year. And, finally, though our integration cost per penny per share favorable in Q1, we expect our total integration costs for the year to be in line with our original estimates ship in the penny per share to the remainder of the year. Our guidance for acquisition and disposition volumes, development investments and total merger and integration costs for the full year remains unchanged. We also remain on track to capture full 20 million of overhead synergies on a run rate by year-end. And we expect to continue capturing additional NOI opportunities included in our forecast, primarily in the latter part of this year as operating practices and platforms become [indiscernible]. So that’s all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Jessica, we’ll now turn the call back to you for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Wonder if you could provide what same-store revenue for the first quarter was with the MAA legacy portfolio and the Post legacy portfolio?
Tom Grimes: Sure Nick. This is Tom. In the, so for revenue expense NOI and ARU for those revenue, revenue was 1.3 for Post and MAA was 3.3.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just in terms of reduction of same-store revenue growth. What drove that lower? Was that specific markets? Was it the Post legacy portfolio was it more broad-based, if you could just provide a little more color there?
Al Campbell: Nick, this is Al. That was really primarily related to new lease pricing as Tom mentioned in his comments. What we’ve seen in the early part of the year was new lease pricing and seasonally as it is negative beginning the year and begin in the 3% down range. But the other side of that is renewals were very strong. They were 6% over. And so what we had our forecast with expectation as we move in the March, move into the digital leasing season, the new lease price will begin to improve in the state; down the 3% range lower than we expected. Good news is as move into April, as Tom mentioned, we are seeing significant change and it did, and we did see the trends about to more than what we thought.
Eric Bolton: Nick, this is Eric. I’ll also add that, I mean the other thing, if you look at just the Post portfolio and the performance on new lease pricing in Q1, I would really characterize the performance by two things that went on. One is obviously that -- those are the submarkets where supply pressures are the greatest, and that was clearly evident. But, secondly, we also made a conscious decision in Q1 to focus our efforts on the Post portfolio towards stabilizing certain variables and positioning that portfolio for a more robust level of performance in the more important summer leasing season. So namely what we did as we focused on pulling exposure down, improving occupancy and, importantly, repopulating our LRO revenue management system with all the correct and updated data that was frankly lacking and so we’ve got all that accomplished in the first quarter. And as a consequence of that, we think that, that portfolio is a much stronger position as we head into, frankly, the more busier important season of the summer. The challenge you have is that when you do re-price some leases in that first quarter, I mean you kind of carry them over the quarters two and three. And so as we -- but we thought that was the right trade-off to make, and we certainly think that the benefits are going to begin really show up latter -- in later this year despite clearly there being more supply pressure in those markets, the submarkets. We think that there is real opportunity as the year plays out.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And just finally in terms of the new same-store revenue range, first quarter is obviously at the low end of that. So there is assumed acceleration throughout the year. Can you walk through the assumptions that are underlying that new range in terms of occupancy and doing under a lease rate growth? How you would expect same-store revenue to trend on a quarterly basis throughout the year?
Al Campbell: Nick, this is Al. The basis of for that is really, we expect the legacy MAA portfolio to be strong in that initial 3% to 3.5% pricing range and to be for a stable through the year in revenue performance. But what you have as you had -- the Post portfolio came on board at lower point and we expect that to increase over the year, as we capture those opportunities for improvement that Eric mentioned and so that will continue and probably intensify in the third and fourth quarter. And so on our total performance for the adjusted combined portfolio, you will see continued slight improvement through the year primarily in third and fourth quarter making up that 2.8% to 3.2% range for the year. Than the net result is just not to be lost and as we tweaked the midpoint by 25 basis points, and we think that it’s a fairly modest adjustment, but we think it was a right long-term decision to make.
Operator: And we will go next to Drew Babin with Baird & Company. Please go ahead.
Drew Babin: On some of the more CBD focused REIT for earning calls. So far this quarter and there has been some talk about elevated supply levels kind of looking at the national data. Looking a bit worse kind of into the end of ‘17 and into ‘18 and so just missing some of that data is being more kind of Sunbelt oriented and getting more suburban. And I guess, my question is are you seeing that and as you compete with new supply, is it mostly the product that just now having these Post assets that is generally more urban or are you starting to see more supply in kind of the MAA legacy suburban markets.
Al Campbell: There are two points on that one is we are seeing permitting trends in our markets across the portfolio -- combined portfolio, permitting is down 10% so far this year as compared to last year. When we look at deliveries forecast, based on the information we have for ‘18 versus ‘17, they are down. So we think that there is growing evidence based on permitting trends and forecast for deliveries, coupled with all the other information that we get from developers we talk to regarding construction costs and financing challenges so on and so forth, to believe that ‘18 is certainly not likely to be worse than ‘17 from a supply perspective. So, yes, I offer that first. Secondly, I mean clearly right now it’s the higher price point more urban-oriented locations where the supply is more evident. And we don’t see anything sort of indicating that there is a shift a foot to all certain developers redirecting their efforts on suburban locations and abandoning their urban locations. There is no evidence to support that and we certainly aren’t seeing it based on our markets and what we monitor. So we think that ‘18 is shaping up to be based, it’s early and these things can change, of course. But based on everything, we have to work with right now, there is a lot of evidence that ‘18 deliveries or will be lower than ‘17 deliveries. And assuming the economy continues to show progress, when you look at the ratio of jobs to deliveries, ‘18 is projected to be slightly better than ‘17.
Drew Babin: That’s very helpful. And then on the acquisition side, it sounds like things are a little slow to come along and it’s the general trend is pricing obviously pretty broadly. Do you anticipate any catalyst or trigger we should look to, maybe if not this year, probably more the next year again what you see more merchant builders looking to sell properties become value add opportunities for you? What is your view the catalyst for more of that become to market and could potentially be portfolio of assets like that?
Al Campbell: Well, I think that, I would read too much into Q1, but just because it tends to be a slower transaction quarter anyway. We tend to do much more, get busier and get more opportunity or deals that going to contract, the first part of the year fallout and we tend to be more successful in the back half of the year. Having said that, catalyst, I think it’s going to be, just as we get later in the cycle, later this year, maybe event to the next year, some of these lease-ups that are underway or perhaps there is more of them out there now than there has been historically. We think that creates some level of pressure. It certainly creates pressure on some of these lease-up in terms of pricing that we’re hoping to get lease-up that we’re hoping to achieve. And if you throw a little prospect of rising interest rates on top of that, collectively that may start to create the catalyst that creates more compelling buy opportunities. Having said that, we certainly see, as I mentioned in my opening comments. We certainly see or lot of investor interest that still pretty strong out there for multi-family. So we haven’t really seen as a cap rates that move a little bit. I would suggest that maybe the number of people at the table putting bids and maybe down slightly from what we saw a year or two ago. But the people that are there are still pretty aggressive overall. And so, we’re staying patient. But I think this is we get later this year into next year, there may be little bit more opportunity that makes sense for us.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Mike Lewis with Suntrust. Please go ahead.
Mike Lewis: On the same-store revenue, I understand there is the supply pressure in the Post portfolio where little more than you expected. April is coming back. But you can make up all that, so you want to head and lower the guidance a little bit. But productivity confidence after 2.8% same-store revenue growth in 1Q, that you could do 2.8% to 3.2% for the full year when it seems like we’re in this several quarters in a row of kind of decelerating growth. Is it -- maybe it’s some easier comps in the Post portfolio, maybe it’s supply tailing off, just kind of what gave you comfort there?
Al Campbell: Well, first of all, we weren’t surprised by anything in the first quarter. We elected to make a conscious decision to, as we got into the Post portfolio, and remember when we closed on it in early December, but as we got into it, what we believe that the thing to do was to really position the portfolio for stronger performance in the busier summer leasing season. Having said that, what gives us confidence that we will see some pickup is frankly, we’re heading into the busier summer leasing season where leasing velocity and demand tends to really pick-up. And we think that, that coupled with candidly, what we do see are some comparisons in the Post performance from last year, and the way that we executive with LRO, supply pressures notwithstanding, we think that getting to that midpoint of the range the we revised 2% or 3% is something that we feel pretty confident. And having said that, as Tom mentioned, I mean in his comments, I mean the progress that we’ve seen on renewal pricing in the Post portfolio is pretty impressive. And recognizing that we’re renewing a bigger component of our portfolio than we ever have, that’s helpful. And so I think that there is a lot of trends that -- one other thing as I think it’s important that not to get lost in all this, because when you look at the Post portfolio, not could be lost in sort of the opportunity that we’re underwriting here, is recognizing with that portfolio prior to the close of our merger was carrying an average rent level that was 44% higher than legacy MAA, 44% higher rent. But yes, we were capturing a 100 basis points higher NOI margin. We think that spells opportunity.
Mike Lewis: Thanks. My second question. Some of that I guess as a whole of the smaller markets are lagging a little bit, some particularly. Is there a trend going on there? Maybe jobs moving to larger markets more? Are you starting to see some supply pressures in some of the smaller markets?
Eric Bolton: No, if you look at the key driver of sort of performance in that, the secondary markets, 2.9% effective rent growth, the large markets 2.9% effective job growth. If you look on the NOI side, you do see a trade-off that’s primarily expense driven and it relates to a prior year comparison when we received their credit last year that didn’t reoccur this year. So we’re pleased with where the revenue trends are in those areas, and believe places like Charleston just keep drawing jobs, building airplanes, building trucks, and building more of those, and it’s encouraging to see these secondary markets performance closing the gap.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Tom Lesnick from with Capital One. Please go ahead.
Tom Lesnick: I guess first, looking at Houston, the same-store year-over-year comps stood out once again this quarter. Just wondering how we should think about that same-store performance through the year. And then the second question on Houston. Historically, that’s been one of the larger markets with respect to moving out to purchase a home for you guys. Just wondering how that metric is trending for that market right now?
Al Campbell: Sure. When you think about Houston, we want you to think about it is 3.5% of our net operating income first. And then what I would say is, with the Post merger, we picked up more or exposure really in the same-store group for the first time in interloop and had some significant stabilizing to do there and the trends are improving their both in terms of occupancy exposure and asking rents. But we don’t see Houston coming out of the woods this year. On home buying, it’s been in line with our other groups. It’s not booming on home buying and it’s not well under, it’s running about 20%.
Tom Lesnick: Got it. And is there any bifurcation in performance between more infill properties in Houston as opposed to the ones outside the loops?
Al Campbell: Yes. Both have pressure, but interloop pressure is larger.
Tom Lesnick: That’s helpful. And then final one from me. Turning to redevelopment for a second, I appreciate the detail you gave every quarter with respect to the increase in rent from the redevelopment units. How is that trending on the Post units relative to the MAA units historically?
Al Campbell: It’s about a 10% bump versus, let’s say 9%. But it’s larger dollar figures on the whole risk spending. The Post locations are just spectacular. I mean we’re little gave you about it. And with that we’ve got people building high-rises next door to us that gives us the freedom to go in and put in brand in most of them and do a little bit more robust and like an $8,000 innovate, we’re getting $150 improvement versus probably an $80 redevelopment and $90 improvement. So significant.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Rich Anderson: So if I can just double down that last question. If you’re spending more money on the Post redevelopments and getting a 10% return and you’re getting 9% on a lesser amount of money in the MAA, why is the Post opportunity a better option?
Eric Bolton: Well, we’re not saying it’s a better option? What we’re saying is that the submarket and in the competition set that we’re competing with supports an ability to invest. And frankly, in those locations, we have to spend a little bit more on the improvement, but we’re getting commentary at higher level of rent bump as a consequence of the higher investment that we’re making and ultimately the IRR, if you will, is very comparable to what we’re see between both…
Al Campbell: Sorry. Its larger in terms of, the numbers are larger and the opportunity as a percent of the portfolio is larger.
Tom Grimes: Well said, we are excited that we able to put out more capital at very strong returns in general. That helps our value production.
Rich Anderson: I get that. Anything you can get a 10% return on is good business. But what is the average, if it’s 8,600 for unit on Post, what is it -- what gets you 9% on an MAA, what’s that number?
Eric Bolton: Closer to 4,400.
Rich Anderson: Okay, all right. Got it. So next question, if I could be maybe a little whack, cynical here. The expense outperformance in the first quarter or maybe this is just me talking, offered the opportunity for you to introduce a new revenue range that, let’s say, is easier to be, this year. I mean is that just too diabolical of a way of thinking about this?
Al Campbell: I’ll just -- what we as Eric mentioned earlier, what we’re trying to do with that is because we saw those new lease pricing trends go a little further into Q1 at the range they were than we expected, that have some impact in the future as our leases re-price, so we’re just dialing at in Richard we’re going to do that. That we were very excited to see as we got in the expense side contract opportunity that were glad than we saw, so we were very glad to see the offset, but really they are unrelated.
Eric Bolton: You give us more diabolical credit than we deserve.
Rich Anderson: And then last question, maybe for Eric. You offering the call from the story from MAA has been this full cycle story, when you look at the sign curve of your full cycle and kind of that is less downside comparable upside. You know that story. Does the introduction of Dallas and Atlanta kind of disrupt this so-called full cycle opportunity. You would think it would. Those are bold bracket type markets. So you’re giving up some of that in exchange for this, sort of, synergy story?
Eric Bolton: I don’t think so, Rich. We think that ultimately what drives our full-cycle performance profile, if first is really the focus on the region that we’re in, that I would argue offers some of the best job growth dynamics and ultimately demand dynamics for our product over the full-cycle. I think that the best way to manage through a down cycle is to really be well diversified and to have a very strong operating platform, and we think that with the combination of Post into our portfolio that in a lot of ways we further diversified who we are, while we certainly are in a lot of the same markets, we’re in different submarkets I -- and I would certainly argue that with adding Post 20,000 plus units to our existing 80,000 units, I would say it probably definitely adds more performance upside in a strong part of the cycle, early part of the cycle. I don’t -- it’s hard to argue just at a very high level that it may not weaken a little bit, the downside part. But we don’t -- protection if you will, but we don’t think so. So we’ve got as a consequence of still retaining a strong level of diversification in both inner loop and suburban and also being very well balanced now between, sort of, A and B price product and candidly having an operating platform that just keeps getting stronger and stronger and the balance sheet that keeps getting stronger and stronger, we think that the protection, if you will, during the down part of the cycle is the stronger and since it has ever been. And arguably, I would suggest that we may have improved our up-cycle or our product cycle performance profile a little.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. It’s only been a couple of quarters since integration, but looking at NOI margins it actually declined sequentially during the first quarter. So I’m wondering what gives you the comfort that you could improve it this year and is that really stated goal for 2017?
Eric Bolton: Well, it is the stated goal, but first of all, it’s not two quarters, it is four months. Second of all, we think that the margin enhancement opportunity, as I said a moment ago, just if you step back and just remember that this Post portfolio is a portfolio that was carrying 44% higher average rent but yet MAA was getting 100 basis points higher NOI margin. There’s just a lot of opportunity, a lot of different places. And what, and so if you look at December, the month of December and look at first quarter, you have seasonal factors are going on there. So I wouldn’t read too much into that comparison. It’s more of a seasonal trend. I think as the year plays out and you can start to really get seasonal, take some of the seasonality out of the equation, you start we looking at year-over-year or comparable quarters year-over-year. I think that’s where you will really start to see some evidence of margin enhancement.
John Kim: But you think we’ll be able to see beginning in the second quarter versus fourth quarter based on the leases you signed so far?
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean we saw margin improvements in the Post.
Tom Grimes: 130.
Eric Bolton: As you move into the third quarter you will start seeing it more as we, third and four for cash majority of those synergies for the year. So more heavily in those that period, John, I would say.
Tom Grimes: I think important to look year-over-year we improve the margins of total same-store about 60 basis points and for the whole portfolio 130 on the other side of the portfolio.
John Kim: Okay. The gap between new and renewal leases, I know you’re expecting that to condense a little bit. But I’m just wondering if that 800 basis point spread is the widest you’ve seen?
Tom Grimes: It is probably the widest we’ve seen in this cycle, but it is always widest at this time of the year. The gap gets wider and the slower winter months and then it tightens in the summer months.
Operator: And we will go next to Conor Wagner with Green Street. Please go ahead.
Conor Wagner: Tom, where was overall renewals in April. I know you are in the Post portfolio, but for the combined portfolio, please?
Tom Grimes: Sure. Renewals for the group was, in April was 64.
Conor Wagner: Great. Thank you. And then Eric, if you could tell me what you are thinking about the development platform and possibly adding some land to it. If you guys are exploring those opportunities?
Eric Bolton: Con, we are exploring them. We haven’t really done anything at this point in terms of any commitments. The only thing that I suspect that we will get started this year is an expansion of community that we owned in Charleston that we closed on in December of last year that has a Phase II component to it. But we are, David and his team are pretty active out looking for opportunity at the moment. We haven’t really committed anything at this point. If we defined a very compelling site with an opportunity to get that site productive pretty quickly and it all make sense given where we are in the cycle, we wouldn’t hesitate to pull the trigger on it. But I think that one of the things going forward that will be very sensitive to as development is never going to be a huge part of who we are even if today at just over $500 million pipeline, it’s still constitutes about 3% to 3.5% of enterprise value. We think it will probably -- we would like to keep it in that range. So we’ll never -- we never see it approaching -- I don’t think we will ever see approaching 6%, 7%, 8% of who we are in terms of enterprise value. Secondly, one of the things that we’re going to be very focused on is ensuring that if any land position is taken, that it’s something that we’re confident we can get productive in short order within 12 to 18 months kind of time frame. Banking a bunch of capital in the balance sheet that is -- it’s not, sort of what we do. So that -- those principles sort of guide how we move forward.
Conor Wagner: Okay, thank you. And then maybe as it seems, if you guys has to comment briefly on operating trends you see into the D.C. market?
Tom Grimes: Operating trends on the D.C. market are positive. I think you know Ron and the team there are a stable good bunch. And I think we see steady improvement in that area and are thrilled with the redevelopment opportunity. So I think strengthening is how I would characterize that improving.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Gaurav Mehta: So can you talk about the improvement in new and a lease growth in April versus first quarter. I was wondering if you could comment on in which market do you seeing that improvement?
Tom Grimes: Yes, sure, Gaurav. When we look on a seasonal basis, it’s a really following the trend with the sharpest improvement in those areas where Post and MAA overlap. So with the upswing, it is Atlanta, Dallas, Orlando, Tampa, where we’ve seen sort of the biggest changes.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay. And I guess, in your prepared remarks in regards to Post portfolio you also mentioned a focus on loading exposure to certain market. I was wondering if you could comment on what’s the timing on selling assets in of those markets Atlanta and Dallas where you plan to lower exposure?
Eric Bolton: Well, we have targeted in our guidance 125 million, 175 million of dispositions this year. We are about to come to market fairly soon with that group. There is some Dallas, Atlanta in that group. But we’re going to be approaching that in a fairly sort of study fashioned. We will -- we do have a goal over the next two to three years to pull down our exposure in Dallas and Atlanta just to really get the portfolio allocation where we are more comfortable with it. But there is no immediate plan to do anything radical in terms of a major shift. You will see that the steady work down over the next two or three years.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Just wanted to touch. You mentioned that the new lease rates, softening lease rates drove the reduction and same-store revenue. But got the sense that renewals were also a little bit stronger than you expected, and I was wondering if that’s offset any bit of softness in new lease rates at all?
Al Campbell: Renewals were about where we expected them. In Austin I think we expected to be able to make improvement on the Post side and then America side has been solid in that 6% to 6.5% range for some time.
Eric Bolton: What we roughly expect and going forward new lease pricing will improve into positive and the renewals will remain strong.
Austin Wurschmidt: And then could you just a break down how, what you expect renewals to come in for MAA and Post into May and June?
Eric Bolton: Sure. They are, we’ve got Post continues its improvement from May to 59. Mid-America continues above 6. June is a little early to tell, but I want expect those trends to continue.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. Thanks for the detail. And then you talked about a lot of the NOI synergies that you expect to capture in 2017 from Post is being in back half weighted. I just wondered if you’re still comfortable with that 4 million to 5 million that you had previously underwritten.
Eric Bolton: We’re absolutely to that and we are comfortable with that. And we were very encouraged to the first quarter that we had a little quicker start on the expenses that we have thought, that’s even add to that curve. But a large part of that still going to be in the back half of the year as we really begin to compound the revenue improvements somebody’s things that Eric and Tom will talk about in the third and fourth quarter.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks. And then can you just remind us again of when you expect the transition onto a single revenue management platform?
Al Campbell: We have transitioned the revenue management platform. Work got done in the first quarter or on one system.
Austin Wurschmidt: Is that mentioned or sooner than anticipated, correct?
Eric Bolton: No, again the revenue management component of it is, was went as planned.
Al Campbell: It’s more the back office accounting and then also the property management system that is where the leases are contained separately. Other all system kind of sits on top of that. Its own function and that is combined and working well.
Eric Bolton: And that transition is really just an upgrade in systems that gets early fourth quarter or early first next year.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Robert Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Robert Stevenson: Eric, are you talked a couple of times during the call on the upside that you guys expect on the NOI margin from the Post assets. Beyond that, what’s the biggest upside out of Post going forward today, if you start the clock today that you expect to achieve?
Eric Bolton: Well, certainly the combined balance sheet of the two companies has certainly resulted in a much stronger consolidated balance sheet and we, as Al mentioned, will be approaching the bond market later this year as a consequence of putting the two companies together. As you recall, when we closed the merger, S&P upgraded us to the third run of investor grade that day. Moody’s did so recently. And we sliced off a fair amount of interest expense on an annual basis just as a consequence already and we think going forward that will continue to pay some benefits. I would tell you that other than the NOI opportunity, the redevelopment opportunity is quite significant and as Tom mentioned in his comments, that is proving to be, just I think that opportunity is going to be bigger, far better than we ever really imagined it would be. So we’re very excited about what we see happening there. And that’s something that will play out frankly over the next three or four years. And beyond that then I would tell you was one of the benefits of putting the Post platform with MAA was frankly just another opportunity to deploy capital in accretive manner through new development. And at this point in the cycle, we’re being pretty careful about any commitments in terms of cranking up anymore new development. But we’ve certainly again believe that, that platform supported by our operating platform and balance sheet is going to be another component of long-term value creation that we’re very attracted to.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And when you guys look at supply, not just in an overall market or submarket, but supply and that should directly impact your assets or especially the Post assets given the sort of more urban nature of that. Are there any markets or submarkets where you think that the worst is yet to come from a supply standpoint in terms of lease-up concession, etcetera, that is going to sort of push down rental rate growth within the Post portfolio?
Eric Bolton: Not that you’re not already aware of, Rob. I mean that sort of bucket core door is seeing the expected level of supply come onboard. Same with uptown in Charlotte and inner loop Dallas, let’s say. But, I think largely, we were beginning -- we felt that and we will continue to and then it improves in ‘18.
Al Campbell: The only market I would add that worth monitoring is Dallas. I think that Dallas inner loop area is getting a fair amount. So we will keep an eye on that one. But I would agree. I think all of the others are there is no reason to expect that it is going to deteriorate from where it is today.
Tom Grimes: And then Houston drops in half again and Nashville drops off by 3,000 units. There are some bright spots out there as well.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then Tom, while you were talking earlier about the weakness in new leases in the Post portfolio. Was that concentrated in a couple of assets that we’re facing some supply issues, was that fairly widespread. How would you sort of characterize that? Is that a submarket, market or just a portfolio sort of issue at this point?
Tom Grimes: It was fairly widespread. It was sort of probably weakest in Houston the gap wise and then strongest places like Tampa or D.C.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then last one for Al, I think that I heard you say something about $0.01 impact on property taxes. Was that sort of positive or the negative side and the remainder of ‘17?
Al Campbell: That was to the negative side unfortunately on that and I think but really what that is as we just moved our range to 5.5% to 6.5% with 50 basis points increase and we still feel good about the expectations for tax rates and the valuations. It’s really more related to as we get information get into it. We think we may have little less favorability on appeals that we’re making that will fall into favorable results in ‘17 from ‘16 than we had in 15 to ‘16 and so we feel like overtime into it, as we go forward, tax rates will continue to moderate a little bit, but in ‘17 we have a little bit of noise.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. How we reconcile that and so if property taxes are roughly at third of the expenses load and those are going -- you are revising that upward, but then you’re taking same-store expenses, same-store expense guidance down for the year, what overwhelms the increase in property taxes, where are you seeing the benefits to be able to lower the same-store expense guidance?
Al Campbell: Benefits that we’re seeing in getting earlier on some of the synergy opportunities have been really, really good, Rob. And so we’ve been able to get into contracts with contract labors and our vendors and insurance pricing have been able to get favorability early than we expected, maybe little more than we expected and so that more than offset that pretty increase in real-estate taxes and expenses.
Operator: And we will go next to Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Omotayo Okusanya: Two questions from me. The first one around the reduction in the same-store revenue guidance. The new rental rate that was again trending negative in the first quarter. Again you kind of mentioned that part of the whole process of why you are signing leases at those rates was the kind of setup to go into the spring leasing season. But I guess, I’m trying to understand a little bit, how exactly those benefits you go into the spring leasing season, if you sign the lease and that tenant is going to be in there for at least a year?
Al Campbell: Well, it basically if in the first quarter, let’s just say that over the course of the year, you have 100% of your leases to renew, or to, or 100% of units to reprice. In the first quarter you’re going to reprice, I don’t know, 20% of them, 18% of them. In the second and third quarter, you’re going to reprice 65%, 70% of them. And so we would rather reprice or be in a position, stronger position to reprice when you’re going to be repricing a higher percent of your portfolio over the course of the year. So you can, if you will, sacrifice a little pricing on a smaller portion of the portfolio in order to gain more robust pricing on a bigger percent of the portfolio in the second and third quarter and net-net for the year come out with the better results.
Tom Grimes: I mean, you’ve got there. I mean all of the pricing a lot of them, if you will, is driven by exposure. And what Eric was saying, we improve the exposure on the Post assets by 190 basis points and it’s now 7.2%, going into that season and that pushes the rates up on more people more aggressively.
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay. I think I got to understand that. But I guess the backdrop of rising supply in some of the key markets, how confident are you that, again that upside in pricing that you want in the spring will actually happen as again you have more supply in the market. Isn’t that kind of what’s putting more pressure on the new rental rates?
Eric Bolton: But you also have more leasing velocity that takes place in the summer months as well. If you go demand picks up, but in the summer months versus the winter months.
Al Campbell: And we believe there is a non-market opportunity there. Going back to Eric’s point about the margin, we feel like there is rent gap to close based on the progress that we’re making on a renewal side of Post and where we look at where those units are price in the market that and when you add in redevelopment, that we can grow the Post new lease trends is greater than market opportunity.
Omotayo Okusanya: That’s helpful. And then just also on the same-store OpEx for 1Q. You saw a much bigger decline in your larger markets versus just smaller markets. Does that have anything to do with just the fact that you have more of an overlap of the Post properties in the larger markets and some other synergies we’ll driving that versus the smaller markets?
Al Campbell: Yes, that’s a fair point.
Tom Grimes: That’s correct.
Operator: And we will go next to Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Neil Malkin: Eric, I think in the last call you talked about stricter lending standards making it more difficult not only in general for incremental supply to occur this cycle but because of that, more lending would be focused toward the more certain or more highly thought after urban markets and would actually have even more beneficial impact to your Sunbelt markets with less construction financing happening there. Are you still confident in that? Are you still seeing that? Or are you seeing a willingness of banks to lend for to you for construction financing in your market?
Eric Bolton: Well, all I can really speak to is our Sunbelt markets in the Southeast. What I can tell you is yes. I mean all of the developers that we talked to continue to indicate that financing for construction projects is becoming more difficult to achieve. More equity required, lower loan to values, requiring them to either introduce more equity into the transaction and or bring in some sort of mezzanine financing to bridge their funding needs net-net, putting pressure on returns. And so, I think that evidence is starting to manifest itself, as I mentioned earlier, permits so far this year are down 10% versus where they were last year. And when you look at the current pipeline and deliveries that we know are going to come online as we headed into the next year, known deliveries are down next year from what we’re seeing this year. So I continue to believe that there is a likelihood that we are likely to see the worst of the supply pressure this year. Things can change, as I said earlier. But based on everything that we’ve got visibility on right now, there is nothing that causes us to believe that supply pressures are headed towards in acceleration in 2018.
Neil Malkin: And then can you talk about your pipeline or opportunities that for recently completed or in leased up properties?
Eric Bolton: Well, it’s -- we are looking at a lot of things right now. And we continue to have -- I think more opportunities are being brought online in terms of development and lease-up is underway. And I think just as we get later in the year, the opportunities become more compelling, because we often see in the first, let’s call it six months of the year, that people that plan to sell tend to get out there and market their opportunities broadly to the market. And often we see a lot of deals go under contract in early part of the year that for a host of reasons don’t get close, and then as we get into Q3 and Q4, the opportunities often come back because they fall out of contracts. So we just tend to be much more successful in leveraging our execution capabilities and all cash acquisition capabilities and to sort of the value that were looking for in the back half of the year. And so as supply does sort of come online increasingly over the course of this year and we get into that busy season where, I think a lot of people are counting on a lot of good things happening. Undoubtedly, there is going to be, I think more opportunities that will become available later this year. So we’re going to be patient and see. I mean, we’re given sort of the scale that we have, the balance sheet that we have and the focus that we have on this region. We know the deals and in most cases everybody wants us looking at the deals. And our pipeline is fairly active right now. But we are being patient.
Neil Malkin: Okay, great. And last one from me. Can you talk about the Post properties in terms of how things are going on the ground? I’m assuming there’s probably some turnover from leasing or property managers, maybe to had some impact on the first quarter. How that’s going, how that’s transitioning, do you feel comfortable that you had everything in place, kind of all the potential issues that’s [indiscernible] if any?
Eric Bolton: The answer is yes. So we think that we’ve got everything settled here at this point. These things are hard. I mean they’re just tough. And you’ve got two organizations, very proud. Post around for 40 years and quite a legacy and there is a lot of emotion in all of this. And so you sort of have the challenge to work through initially. Secondly, frankly, we just, at the property level and frankly at the corporate level, we approach the business in philosophically in some ways and in fact procedurally different. And as a consequence of those differences, we have different expectations for different positions. They may be called the same thing in both companies, but our expectations and the accountabilities that we establish in some cases were different. And so with those two factors, you have some people that sort of adjust and you have some people that don’t adjust. And frankly you have some people that are in positions that ultimately we conclude they are unlikely to be able to be a good fit for that position given sort of the way we expect the position to perform and so changes are made. So yes, we made again a conscious decision to address all that ASAP and we have made a conscious decision to address all that in the winter slower leasing season. And I would tell you at this point we are set. We feel like, I mean we’ve got a great team of folks in place. We’ve got all of the, sort of the onsite leadership stabilized and we think we’re in a great position as we had into the summer months now.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Q - Dennis McGill Just going back to new lease growth in the first quarter, the negative 3%. Just back into that the impact on the guidance. Is it about 200 basis points worse than what you would have thought going in the quarter?
Al Campbell: You’re talking about for Q1? Q - Dennis McGill Q1, right, the negative 3% on new leases.
Al Campbell: Yes. The expectation was more at the end of the quarter in March. I mean, we expect to be in that range in the early part of the quarter. We expected the new lease pricing to improve and as we move in the March and that was the expectation that was different. Q - Dennis McGill So the 3% negative was fairly consistent through the quarter, is that what you are seeing?
Al Campbell: In April, just to follow-up with your point. In April, as Tom said, we did see about 200, 190 basis points swing in that. We usually see that in March a little earlier with those points. Q - Dennis McGill Yes.
Al Campbell: The range is correct. We uses in March and we saw in April and we have [indiscernible] to our guidance. Q - Dennis McGill Okay. And then as you think about just the impact within the quarter and compare where you ended up versus what you might have thought at the beginning of the quarter, what do you think drove the stepped-up competition. I would assume you have your arms around which products are around you and come into markets. So is there anything in particular you can put your finger on that would have cause either yourself or developers and you get more competitive?
Al Campbell: No, not really. I think that -- I mean again it’s -- I think we were focused on not only the market conditions but the other sort of thing that we alluded to is that -- we had we made a conscious decision to address what we felt like were some weakness in exposure and occupancy levels that we wanted to get addressed and before we head into that busier season, And I think also, as Tom alluded to, we also made a conscious decision to really focus on renewal practices in a very aggressive way in the first quarter and we’ve seen great results as a consequence to that. So I think that what we’re talking about here is a balance as a fairly modest level of adjustment, 25 basis points in terms of a midpoint adjustment on revenue expectations. It really just gives us back to, we just -- I think the supply levels broadly have just put into the slower leasing season of the first quarter combined to just create a little later in the quarter pickup in pricing trends, on new lease pricing than what we typically see. And as Al alluded to, April was a significant jump in improvement and we usually see that earlier in the first quarter and so just a little later as a consequence of supply terms.
Operator: And at this time, we have no further questions and I will turn it back over to you, Mr. Argo.
Tim Argo: Thank you. We appreciate everyone being on the call and see many of you at Mary. Thanks.
Operator: This conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

===== 2016 Q4  (2017-02-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the MAA Fourth Quarter 2016 Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 2, 2017. I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. Please go ahead, sir.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Tanisha, and good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the safe-harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning’s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As recap in yesterday’s earnings release, we had a busy end to 2016. A significant amount of our focus was, of course, in completing the close of the merger with Post Properties. Our merger was closed fully in line with our original expectations. And we had a successful launch at day one consolidated operations on December 1. In addition to our merger activity, during the quarter we were also successful closing on the sale of an additional five properties and completed the acquisition of a new lease-up property in the Charleston, South Carolina market. And finally, during the quarter, we continue to make good progress on our development and lease-up activities, capturing solid Same Store results and delivering overall core FFO results that were slightly ahead of our expectations. With the merger transaction now closed and our operating reporting systems producing consolidated information, our attention now turns to completing the full integration of all support reporting systems, reconciling more detailed policies and procedures, and ultimately positioning our platform to fully harvest the long-term benefits of the merger. I want to thank our team of associates who are performing at a high level during a very busy time for our company. We’ve been through this merger process before and have developed a lot of strength and capabilities that are clearly on display. Upon announcing our merger with Post, we outlined the fact that we expected the first year of consolidated operations would include some initial earnings dilution as we introduced three key variables that would have a near-term dilutive impact on year-one earnings. Specifically, those variables were the fact that we were bringing a $480 million development pipeline onto the balance sheet that was not yet productive. Secondly, we acquired a portfolio of properties exposed to different submarkets that for the near-term would be facing higher supply pressure. And finally, that in combining the two balance sheets, we were meaningfully strengthening the MAA balance sheet through deleveraging the company by over 600 basis points. As outlined in our earnings release, our initial guidance for 2017 projects FFO per share of $5.72 to $5.92 or $5.82 at the midpoint, which includes $0.15 per share of non-recurring merger and integration costs that we expect to incur as we wrap up consolidation activities. It’s important to note that excluding the non-recurring merger and integration costs from both 2016 results and our 2017 forecast, the midpoint of our forecast represents only a 1.9% decline from prior year. This is despite the short-term pressure from the three factors just noted that will dilute our earnings in 2017. This is a better result than we expected. Our work to date on consolidating and reconciling property operations between MAA and Post has us even more enthused about the opportunity surrounding the long-term value proposition from this merger. Our work to date on the consolidation of back-office systems, reconciliation of property-level practices, rework of existing contracts to acquire the benefits of our enhanced scale and the initiation of significant unit interior redevelopment opportunities, cause us to remain very excited about the merger. We expect the NOI margin enhancement opportunities we’ve previously discussed to become increasingly evident as we approach the end of this year and into 2018. In addition, we remain confident that $20 million of G&A and overhead synergy opportunity that we previously identified will be fully captured in 2018. Tom will discuss in more detail what we are seeing in the way of leasing conditions across the portfolio. Overall demand remains strong. We expect the well-documented pick-up in new supply trends will cause some moderation in rent growth versus prior year. Our combined adjusted Same Store revenue guidance of 3% to 3.5% is largely a result of expected rent growth and we expect to hold continued strong occupancy at around 96%, consistent with our performance in 2016. Demand for apartment housing remains strong across our markets with leasing traffic consistent to what we’ve been experiencing over the past year. Resident turnover or move-outs in the fourth quarter were down as compared to prior year. Encouragingly, based on the trends we see with new permitting and starts across the majority of our markets, coupled with the feedback we receive from developers who find today’s construction financing market significantly more challenging, we remain optimistic that our markets will continue to hold up well as employment markets and wage growth continue to support solid demand. As noted in yesterday’s earnings release, we were successful in acquiring one property in the fourth quarter. The acquisition has attributes consistent with essentially each of the deals we’ve acquired over the past couple of years, namely a high-end newly developed property by a regional developer undergoing initial lease-up in a submarket seeing near-term supply pressure, which created an opportunity for compelling acquisition. We continue to look at a number of additional opportunities and find that overall cap rates appear to be holding up and generally in line to what we’ve seen over the past year. Our guidance for acquisitions in 2017 is in line with performance in 2016. But we remain hopeful that as year unfolds, we may see more opportunities that meet our long established disciplined approach to deploying capital. That’s all I have in the way of prepared comments. And I’ll now turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter Same Store NOI performance for legacy MAA at 4.2% was driven by revenue growth of 3.6% over the prior year. On a sequential basis, we matched last year’s strong seasonal revenue result and declined just 20 basis points from the third quarter to the fourth. The top line was driven by rent growth, as all-in place effective rents increased 3.9% from the prior year. Occupancy exposure trends are strong. January’s average daily physical occupancy of 96% matched January of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period is just 7.3%. As expected, our pricing trends are showing some sign of moderation. During the quarter, blended lease prices on a lease over lease basis increased 2%. On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results. They were led by Fort Worth, Atlanta and Orlando. The secondary markets continued their study revenue performance. Revenue growth in Memphis, Greenville and Charleston stood out. In both portfolios, Houston remains our only market-level worry bead. After the merger, Houston represents just 3.6% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. At the end of January, our combined Houston market’s daily occupancy was 94.3% and 60-day exposure was just 7.3%. Renter demand remains steady and our current residents continue to choose to stay with us. Move-outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 9% over the prior year and turnover dropped again to a low 50.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. Move-outs to home buying dropped 5% and move-outs to renting a house declined 14%. The integration of Post is off to a good start. Progress is being made reconciling our pricing platform. We’ve centralized our pricing process and are now aligning pricing practices. On the redevelopment front, opportunities that have been identified are greater than we initially expected. On the Post portfolio, we believe we have a pipeline of 1,300 units. We have already begun to upgrade units in the Post portfolio and look forward to updating you further throughout the year. For the MAA portfolio, during the quarter we completed 1,300 interior unit upgrades, bringing our total units redeveloped for this year to just over 6,800. On legacy MAA, our redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remains robust. On a combined basis, our total redevelopment pipeline is in the neighborhood of 30,000 units. Our active lease-up communities are performing well. Rivers Walk’s stabilized - Rivers Walk Phase II stabilized on schedule in the fourth quarter. Post Parkside at Wade is 61% leased and on schedule to stabilize in the third quarter of this year. Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes Phase II in Orlando is 69% leased and on schedule to stabilize at the end of this year. Post Afton Oaks is 15% leased and in line with our expectations. Given the conditions in Houston, we have planned for it to stabilize in the second quarter of 2018. Our new acquisition community in Charleston is on track. And finally the Retreat at West Creek Phase II which has not delivered yet, but it’s already an incredibly good 84% pre-leased. We are pleased with our progress thus far in the Post merger. The operating structure of the combined companies is in place and functioning well. There is a high degree of overlap in both systems and markets. The combined team is quite capable and we are confident that by reconciling the practices between the two companies that we will fully capture the opportunities of this merger. Al?
Albert Campbell: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I’ll provide some additional commentary on the company’s fourth quarter earnings performance, the balance sheet activity, and then finally on the initial guidance for 2017. Net income available for common shareholders was $0.44 per diluted common share for the quarter. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.50 per share which was $0.01 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance, despite $0.02 of dilution from the Post merger, which was not included in the previous guidance. Operating performance for the quarter continued to be strong in line with our expectations. Interest expense and disposition timing combined produced majority of the $0.03 per share favorable performance for the quarter, which was partially offset by the $0.02 per share dilution from the Post merger. For AFFO for the quarter was $1.40, which represents of 4.5% growth over the prior year, despite the Post dilution. Core FFO for the full-year was $5.91 per share, which represents 7% growth over the prior year. Core AFFO for the year was $5.29 per share, which represents 10% growth over the prior year. And very healthy 62% dividend payoff ratio for the year, which is well below the sector average. During the fourth quarter, we acquired one community for $70 million, and sold five communities for $113 million in gross proceeds completing our capital recycling plans for the year. Total gains of $32 million will recognize related to the dispositions during the fourth quarter. For the full-year, five acquired communities combined totaled $334 million of capital investments. Our 12 communities were sold producing combined gross proceeds of $265 million, and $80 million of recorded gains on sale. We also funded $16 million of additional development costs during the quarter, bringing total development funding for the year to $59 million. Our total development pipeline year-end now contains nine communities including the six acquired from Post, with total expected development cost of $562 million of which $200 million remains to be funded. We expect NOI yields to average around 6.4% once these communities are completed and stabilized. During the fourth quarter, we completed several important financing goals for the company. First, we assumed over $900 million of debt in the Post merger with very minimal transfer costs. In conjunction with this, we expanded our credit facility to $1 billion from $750 million and refinanced $300 million term loan acquired from Post to extend the maturity date and improve the terms. And also as mentioned in our prior quarter release, we postponed our original plans for bond deal in late 2006. This allowed the Post merger to close and enabled us to capture the benefits of additional balance sheet strength from the combined balance sheets prior to completing a new deal. Immediately following the merger, Standard & Poor’s did upgrade our investment grade rating to BBB plus from BBB, which improved our current pricing and several of our borrowings, including our credit facility in term loans, and our expected pricing for future bond deals. At year end, our leveraged defined as debt to total assets for our public bond covenants was 33.9%, which is 700 basis points lower than the previous year. And unencumbered assets were over 80% of gross assets. We also had over $540 million of combined cash and capacity under our unsecured credit facility to provide protection to support our business plans. Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2017 with release you will notice that we are providing guidance for net income for diluted common share, which is reconciled to FFO and AFFO in the supplement. Also given the recent industry focus to a one common non-GAAP earnings measure and a desire to simply our earnings presentation. We are providing FFO guidance only on a NAREIT-defined basis for 2017. Of course, we will continue to clearly disclose significant noncore items such as merger integration costs and a mark-to-market debt adjustment in order to allow modeling as desired. Net income per diluted common share is projected to be at $1.82 to $2.02 for the full year 2017. FFO is projected to be $5.72 to $5.92 per share or $5.82 with the mid-point, which includes $15.0 per share merger integration costs. AFFO is projected to be $5.12 to $5.32 per share or $5.22 at the mid-point. The primary driver of 2017 performance is expected to be the combined adjusted same store NOI growth which is projected to be 3% to 3.5% based on 3% to 3.5% revenue growth and 3% to 4% operating expense growth. Our revenue projections include continued strong occupancy levels averaging about 96% for 2017 combined with average rental pricing in the 3% to 3.5% range for the year. We expect operating expenses to remain under control with real estate tax is the only area that expect to pressure which are projected to continue growing in the 5% to 6% range for the year. We expect acquisition volume to range between $300 million and $400 million with disposition buying range between $125 million and $175 million for the year. We expect to fund between $150 million and $250 million of development cost during 2017 projecting to fully complete six of the nine communities currently under construction. Given our expectation of generating $90 million to $100 million of internal generated cash flow in 2017 along with the anticipated asset dispositions for the year. We do not currently have plans with the new equity during 2017. Our guidance assumes we incur additional $16 million to $20 million of merger and integration cost in 2017 and capture a full $20million of overhead synergies on a run rate basis by the yearend. We also expected to gain capturing additional NOI synergies primarily in the later part of the year as operating practices and platforms become more integrated. So that’s all that we have in the way of prepared comments Tanisha. We’ll turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] and we’ll go ahead and take our first question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Robert Stevenson: Good morning guys. Tom, can you talk a little bit around the same store revenue guidance in terms of what markets are likely to be materially above the sort of range and then what markets other than Houston expected to be sort of below the sort of low end of the range, and where you have some concerns even if it’s not going to be Houston level concerns, but where you’re continuing to see weakening results for 2017.
Thomas Grimes: I’ll start with sort of the strongest of the bunch, and frankly, it lines up pretty well with what 2016 results were, but I would expect things out of Atlanta, Orlando, Phoenix, Raleigh, Tampa, Jacksonville, Charleston and Memphis. If I can’t not mention Memphis, Houston as a slower one and remind that it’s just 3.5% of the portfolio. And then on the slower but frankly we like some of the fundamentals out of it are DC and Savannah. I think both of those have the - those will start a little slower, but I think they both have attributes that give us optimism towards the back half of the year.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then what markets do you think at this point in time have the widest variability in potential results for 2017?
Thomas Grimes: That is relatively I would say hard to predict. Of course, Rob I think the supply side of the equation is relatively clear and their demand stays on as expected. I would tell you that will roll out about as we would expect if we have some sort of shock to the system in some way like we did with the oil shock in Houston that would change volatility. I’m just not very good at seeing those shocks coming around. But right now, we would expect them to be in those ranges.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then Eric, what are you guys thinking at this point in terms of new development starts in 2017 even if they’re sort of fourth quarter sort of loaded. I mean, what do you - given what you acquired potentially in cost and what you had working on mid America. I mean, what does 2017 look like for starts for you guys?
Eric Bolton: The only project that I think you may see is start in 2017 is a phase 2 opportunity we’re currently looking at associated with the acquisition we made in the fourth quarter in the Charleston market, 1201 Midtown is the name of the property. We have an adjacent parcel of land there they were currently looking at, other than that I don’t envision of starting anything new in 2017. Currently the combined development pipeline now represents roughly 3% to 4% of our enterprise value. I think that will probably scale down a little bit over the coming year to two years as we bring some product online, and we’re going to be active in the market looking for opportunity you may see us acquire land site or too, but I would not see a starting anything this year and probably we would be back half of 2018 before you would see us likely start something.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then now, the 3% to 3.5% revenue - Same Store revenue growth guidance that’s just a Mid-America portfolio or that includes post?
Albert Campbell: No, that includes post. I may just clarify that Rob, it’s a great question is the guidance that we put out is on a adjusted combined Same Store basis we’re in line with that, because it’s both portfolios added together as if we owned Post in both years. We have the numbers so we - and we know that’s what interest peoples who want to show that, and there are technical Same Store is properties that we’ve owned for two years. So that guidance is based on adjusted Same Store performance as if we own both 3% to 3.5% combined, obviously that’s with Post coming out of the gate lower than MAA beginning the year, and as we worked in the back part of the year capturing some of the synergies tried closing that gap, but that’s a combined basis.
Robert Stevenson: For the full year how material is the difference if you were providing guidance for just the Mid-America portfolio and then for the Post portfolio.
Eric Bolton: The back end - there is a back half on Post it make up for the first-half…
Albert Campbell: No, it doesn’t make up Robert, but tightens the gap. So in the zero 15 basis points range for the full year but when you’re done, because of the performance that we expect to capture from some of the things that Tom and his team doing on pricing and expenses that you will see more in the third and fourth quarters of the year.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then just lastly, how much of the $0.15 or so from a noncore perspective is sort of frontend loaded or is that sort of ratably throughout the year sort of $3.5, $4.0 a quarter.
Albert Campbell: No, it’s sort of frontend loaded. I would call it 40-30 15-15 if I were modeling it, Rob. And that’s just because half of that is people, that are staying with us to help us integrate these systems that are identified as interim or part time. And as their projects are completed and they began to roll off, you will see that come down. So I would go with 40-30 15-15 range.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll go ahead and take our next question from Nick Joseph. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Just want to go back to one of the previous questions to clarify. So Same Store revenue for the combined company is 3% to 3.5%. How do that breakdown between Post and MAA legacy portfolio.
Albert Campbell: MAA legacy portfolio for the full year - well, two things at segment, at the beginning of the year Post is starting up lower, but for capturing synergies and things by the end of the year they close that gap, so they’re still below but the gap is much tighter. So full year call it between 0 and 50 basis point spread that time we done at the end of the year.
Nick Joseph: Okay. So just to clarify Post is zero to 50 basis points dilutive throughout the year at different place.
Eric Bolton: Yes.
Thomas Grimes: And Nick, this is Tom, one point to add is that the Post portfolio represents about 25% to 30% of our total Same Store portfolio, so that can help you do the balancing that.
Eric Bolton: Good point.
Nick Joseph: Perfect, thanks. And then Eric, I’m just wondering what are your thoughts on the DC market and if it’s a long-term market for you.
Eric Bolton: To be determined, I would tell you, Nick, we’re pretty excited about the properties that are there. We’ve been up there visiting with the teams and getting familiar with the properties or great assets, great locations as you know that DC market is starting to show some signs of recovery, and for the foreseeable future we are enthused to be there and believe it will be a nice complement to our portfolio and don’t have any plans to make any changes.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Eric Bolton: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll go ahead and take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Kim: Thank you. It sounds like supply growth is peaking for the most part of this year. But I’m wondering if there are any market that you’re in where you think supply growth may be at risk of accelerating in 2018?
Thomas Grimes: John, it’s Tom, I think, you will see a little bit of supply growth in Austin, Nashville, and Atlanta that that tends to be more in the urban core area, we are not exposed to that in Nashville, we will see a little exposure to that in Atlanta, and light exposure to that in Austin. You are talking probably about 1,000 to 2,000 unit bump in the each of those markets.
Eric Bolton: John, this is Eric, I will tell you that I think based on just again, I’ve had a lot of conversations with developers over the last several months. And it’s a consistent message that financing is very difficult, right now. And I mean equity capitals available but the financing is difficult, and on that basis it’s hard for me to see supply trends in 2018 being certainly any worse than what they are in 2017. And I would suggest that based on everything that we see right now, we likely we will see supply - I believe in our markets peak this year, and portfolio wide see a little moderation take place in 2018.
John Kim: Can you just - Eric, can you just kind of unwind that’s happening right now with the banks for financing development.
Eric Bolton: Well, I think that there has been a lot more information available and widely sort of put out there suggesting the supply trends and picked up quite a bit, particularly in the high-end of the market, and in some of the more urban locations. And as a consequence of that I think the financing environment has just become a little bit more cautious about funding and financing apartment construction at the moment. And as a consequence of that again, I wasn’t actually in attendance, but I talked a lot of people coming out of the national housing conference last week. And that was absolutely consistent message that financing is very difficult to come by right now. And we put on top of that the rise in land costs, construction costs, construction labor and particulars become increasingly challenging. It just hard to see at this point, how supply trends begin to elevate in any way from where they are today. And in fact I would - as I said a moment ago I believe they will like to say fewer deliveries in 2018 versus what we are seeing in 2017.
John Kim: Okay. And I think, Tom, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that move onto home buying and single family rental declined this quarter. And I’m wondering how much of that is seasonal or is that market driven as far as the market tightening.
Thomas Grimes: That’s a quarter-over-quarter comparison over prior year. So in other words it’s relative to same time last year. So it take seasonality out of it, so that’s an absolute drop.
John Kim: So what do think this is occurring?
Thomas Grimes: I think the myriad - there is a myriad of reasons out there, and it was touched on in the journal this morning with the new home buying stats, the homeownership rate dropping again, I just think it is people pushing back major life decisions, they are buying homes, they’re getting myriad later, they’re buying homes later, and they’re investing in their pets. And so they tend to want to rent longer and value that flexibility.
John Kim: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Thomas Lesnick: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess first, you mentioned construction financing being really hard to come by. You would think that would give REITs that much more of a cost of capital advantage. And at the same time, you talked about your acquisition opportunities, basically looking to buy recently developed assets. So I’m just wondering, what is the calculus in your mind between doing development yourself versus buying recently developed assets? How do you measure that risk adjusted return?
Eric Bolton: Well, generally, I’ll tell you Tom, we look to get a little bit better yield, higher yield on the development side, equation given the fact that we are taking on more risk and we also are tying up capital in a non-productive fashion longer. As a consequence of doing a development versus an acquisition. So call it 100 basis points spread or something of that nature, maybe a little north of that is what we tend to often - or tend to look for. And given where we are right now, we are having a hard time making the numbers work on the development side given the reasons I spoke of a moment ago regarding land costs and construction costs generally particularly construction labor. So we are just - we are not finding - and underwriting as realistically as we can. We really feel that it’s tough to pencil out development right now. And on the acquisition side there has been likewise hard to make the numbers work, and hard to buy anything other than again the characteristics that I spoke up, which is really everything we’ve bought for last two or three years is some sort of recently developed or development by a regional developer that really doesn’t have the balance sheet or the wherewithal to sort of carry the deal for very long-time, or has impatient equity partner involved in the development that anxious to sort of monetize their investment, and I think that has supply trends continue to sort of come online this year, or new products come online this year. I continue to be helpful, we’ll find more that opportunity, and give us the chance to buy at a price point that is frankly pretty down close to replacement value, and without the construction risk associated with it. That’s sort of how we think about it right now, and it continue to sort of stick to that level of discipline.
Thomas Lesnick: Got it. That’s very helpful. Just one more from me. Now that you’ve got your hands on the Post assets, how would you triage the parts of the portfolio for redevelopment? What are the first assets you’re going to consider and what are the metrics you’re looking at on that?
Eric Bolton: Tom, I think, I mean, I pick up on a little bit with triage. I mean, it’s not an emergency situation there in great locations, and they are well maintained. We are really sort of thrilled with the opportunity. And you start with a little bit older assets, but the locations in places like Atlanta and Dallas are phenomenal, and there is a great core of opportunity in those two markets. And then followed probably by the Tampa assets, and their locations and opportunities. And there is good bit of upside in Charlotte, and DC as well, which I think a pretty much rattled off everything that there is short of Orlando and Raleigh, which Orlando has some opportunity as well, though smaller because the assets are newer. It is really just a get in - get us many test units and as we can do in those various markets, hone the scope and then move forward. I will tell you it is likely that the opportunity to redevelop on a per unit basis and the Post assets is going to be a little higher than the average 4,500 and we think we’ll get - we will get a larger rent bump for that, because of the locations, we can do more upgrades like in granite and countertops and get a return for them. So we are excited not just in the volume, but in the sort of the bump in the quality, the bump that will get from the Post redevelopment opportunities.
Thomas Lesnick: Got it. Really appreciate that insight. Nice quarter, guys.
Eric Bolton: You bet. Thanks, Tom.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Richard Anderson: Thank you. Good morning. First of all, congrats on moving to NAREIT-defined FFO. I for one appreciate that a lot. I hope more REITs follow suit. Second is on your AFFO guidance. Is that a quote-unquote normalized AFFO or is that simply - is the difference just CapEx between your FFO guidance and your AFFO guidance?
Albert Campbell: Second, Rich, it is FFO guidance less than normal recurring CapEx pull out.
Richard Anderson: Okay. So you still have the merger costs and the debt mark to market in the AFFO?
Albert Campbell: Yes. You would take the $5.22 midpoint plus $0.15 and that would be more normalized FFO, yes.
Richard Anderson: Got you. You mentioned 30,000 units in redevelopment sort of cross hairs, roughly one-third of the portfolio. How long do you think it’ll take to kind of get through that chunk of activity?
Eric Bolton: I would think that three to five years or better. We are very disciplined about the volume that we put through the pipe, not from a scalability production, but we think it’s vital to test the units side by side with non-renovated units. So that we can look you guys in the eyes and be confident that we’ve gotten the return and we tested it against a unit that is not renovated and that return if real. So for that reason it takes a little bit of time, but we rather go steadily and know that we’re getting the return then get out there. The other thing is that Rich is that we do these as apartments come. We don’t force turnover to occur, and I think that protects the economic side, but we did over 6000 years this year. I mean, we’ve looked at may get to 7000 units or something like that. So you can do the math, as Tom said, it’s probably a three or four-year endeavor.
Richard Anderson: So if you did 7000 on your own, will that number actually go up, because you’re bigger company already think it stays in that range.
Albert Campbell: I think it will probably stay in that range, maybe a bit over but yes.
Thomas Grimes: The Post items will be additive, but not…
Richard Anderson: Right. More to choose from, more to choose from. So by the time the fifth year comes along. What’s the pace by which units start to become redevelopable? In other words, this is kind of circular right. I mean, by the time you’ll add to that redevelopment pool. Do you have a sense of what number of units sort of get to a point just because of the process of age become redevelopment candidates.
Thomas Grimes: It really determines - depends on the market and if we feel like there is an opportunity to grow the top line reinvesting, and we’ve done that in some places and others we’ve never revisited again. So I mean, it’s truly asset by asset or market, sub-market by sub-market.
Albert Campbell: I’ll add to that, Rich. In our underwriting for those, we get our returns on their consulted basis with a less than 10 years underwriting with no kick-out value. So it leaves us that opportunity. We choose to do that.
Richard Anderson: Right. And so also the number of tenants have put holes in the walls is also a function that I supposed to, but hopefully you don’t lease to many of those types of people.
Eric Bolton: No. We tightened our screening processes to help with that a little bit.
Richard Anderson: Okay, good. And last question is kind of big picture for Eric. You guys with your Sun Belt interior focus have shown exactly what you want to show which is stability through different cycles, but I’m curious it is forever saying or do you foresee a period of time in the foreseeable future where coastal starts to be a winner again, and you just kind of have to kind of muscle your way through those things or do you think that there is something systemic about the business that puts the Sun Belt in interior locations and better position for a long time to come.
Eric Bolton: Well, we’re a big believer in the Sun Belt in the interior locations for several reasons. First and foremost it starts with really how do we want to - what sort of earnings profile are we trying to create over a full cycle. What sort of earnings profile we’re trying to create over call it a 5 to 7, 8, 19 year horizon, and we think that ultimately, we can optimize that performance - that earnings performance over that horizon by first and foremost focusing our capital in markets where we think the demand is more likely than not to stay stable and or strong, and this region of the country arguably over that kind of a horizon is going to produce some of the best and least volatile job growth over that period of time. So we like the demand side dynamics in that regional country and choose to allocate our capital within that way. Having said that we understand that these markets like all markets like coastal markets can have supply pressure from time to time, and what we tend to do is just really balance our capital, diversify our capital across this region and in order to try to mitigate some of that pressure. Whether it is both A and B pricing asset or A quality, B quality price assets, as well as suburban and urban locations and that’s what the part of the Post rational for us was the fact that it allows us to further diversify our footprint and further diversify our product and capital across what we see as a very dynamic growth region.
Richard Anderson: So the kind of leading question is, the next chapter of this Company years from now maybe isn’t to like tap into California or more on the East Coast as a means to balance that sort of discussion further or do you - you’re going to stay where you’re at, so to speak?
Eric Bolton: We like staying where we are Rich, and I’ll tell you the other attribute or the other factor that I really think a lot about is where can we take our shareholder capital and create a competitive advantage for it in what is a very, very competitive industry. And we think that a lot of these markets that we choose to compete in offer dynamics and competition frankly, that we can create a superior level of performance out of those markets and out of that create value. Going to a lot of these more institutionally owned markets with pretty sophisticated capital and pretty sophisticated operators, the opportunity to really carve out a differentiation and carve out a competitive advantage I think becomes much more challenging. And ultimately, the value proposition is built around creating competitive advantage, holding on to that and then exploiting that. And we think that the region we’re in allows that.
Richard Anderson: Okay, sounds good. Thanks, appreciate it.
Eric Bolton: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Drew Babin: Good morning, guys.
Eric Bolton: Good morning, Drew.
Drew Babin: Couple of quick questions related to market balance, the large markets relative to the secondary markets. Do you plan to use your pipeline beyond 2017 to maybe increase your exposure in the secondary markets by using the [development there] [ph]?
Eric Bolton: What I would tell you, Drew, is really what we’re focused on increasingly is just focusing our capital on the best growth market opportunities or best growth markets that we see across the region that we focus on. And ultimately, it’s all about achieving diversification and balance, such that we create the best risk-adjusted earnings performance we can over the full cycle. So some of these smaller markets that have very dynamic growth characteristics associated with the places like Charleston, South Carolina; Greenville, South Carolina, you’re going to continue to see us focus capital on markets like that. And of course, we continue to stay interested in markets like Atlanta, and Dallas, and Houston, and Phoenix as well so. So it’s really more a function of where do we think the job growth, demand side of the equation is likely be the strongest, stay very balanced, and then balance within those markets both in more urban-oriented locations as well as some of the suburban or satellite locations, and then also be focused on kind of both an A and the B priced product. And ultimately, we think it sort of creates, as I said earlier, the earnings profile we’re after.
Drew Babin: And also, you talked before about Atlanta and Dallas as two potential markets, where you may manage exposure a little bit after the Post merger. In the disposition guidance for 2017, do you expect that some of those assets might be included in that number? Is there anything specifically that is in there?
Albert Campbell: I think you can assume that some of those acquisitions will come - or dispositions I should say, will come out of those two markets. We are in the process of really evaluating that at this moment. And we’ll have more say on that later this year. But with 14% of our NOI now coming out of the Atlanta area, that’s frankly a little more concentrated than I think we need to be long-term.
Drew Babin: Okay, just lastly on fourth quarter dispositions, what were the nominal and economic yields on those?
Albert Campbell: On the dispositions themselves, sort of the after all CapEx, if you will kind of a cash flow yield on the dispositions is around a 6.2. And I’m sorry, what was the other part of the - or nominal…?
Drew Babin: Just on nominal NOI as well.
Albert Campbell: Yes, it would…
Eric Bolton: Nominal was just over 7, that was for CapEx and [Nashville load] [ph].
Drew Babin: Right. All right, great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes, good morning. Thanks for the details around the guidance. Just a quick question, understand that the $20 million in G&A is built into it as kind of a ramp-up process, but could you talk about just total synergies that are built into the 2017 guidance of the annualized $60 million to $70 million you do expect from the Post deal?
Eric Bolton: Right, it’s a good question, Tayo. So 2017 is primarily focused on capturing the overhead. The biggest impact will be from the overhead synergies of the $20 million. And as you mentioned, it will grow over the year. But by the year-end, we will have captured on a runway basis that full $20 million that we talked about. And in addition to that, we will have some NOI synergies that we talked about that we will begin to capture more so in the third and fourth quarter they’ll begin grow. And initially they will be focused on the pricing performance, in the revenue section and mostly revenue, a little bit of expense. But it’ll take 2018 to really to begin to see the most of that NOI additional synergy to be to be harvested. And so, the majority of 2017 is overhead. We’d call it, $4 million to $6 million into our forecast for other synergies, NOI level synergies, and that’s really what we see. And I will have - we also are seeing some balance sheet synergies, because as I mentioned, we got upgraded by S&P and right on the merger announcement. That immediately took our cost down on our financing instruments, our term loans, amount of credit. And so we expect $2 million in interest savings right off the bat there. So those are really the three that you’ll see the impact in 2017, all three areas.
Omotayo Okusanya: And the total amount of that is what, like $25 million of the $60 million to $70 million you’re expecting or could you just give us a number?
Eric Bolton: I don’t have that total upright, but that’s about the right range.
Thomas Grimes: And Tayo, this is Tom. I’d say about, $20 million to $25 million for everything, including the cost of debt and NOI and overhead.
Omotayo Okusanya: That’s helpful. That’s good. And then second question, fourth quarter results, I mean, some of your secondary markets did experience pretty negative Same Store to NOI growth. A lot of it seems to be driven by just huge increases in operating expense - Same Store OpEx. Could you just talk a little bit about what’s kind of driving some of those big increases in some of those markets?
Eric Bolton: Primarily what you’re looking on the large number like Savannah is taxes to be honest with you, Tayo. And then on the coastal items, with Savannah, Jacksonville and Charleston, you also had some Hurricane Matthew storm mitigation expenses.
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay, that’s helpful. Okay. Okay, that’s great. And then lastly, could you just talk a little bit about just kind of January, February trends in regards to asking rents and renewals and things of that nature?
Eric Bolton: Yeah, sure. For MAA average physical occupancy was 96.2% and consistent with last year’s record performance. Exposures, we’re just under 7.2%, which is 22 bps better than last year. And, Tayo, that’s all current vacant plus notices, 60 days out. And blended rents are up 2%, so about in line with where they were in the fourth quarter.
Omotayo Okusanya: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dennis McGill: Good morning, and thank you, guys. First question just had to do with the guidance for the full year, the 3% to 3.5% of top line. How would that phase through the year by quarter, roughly?
Eric Bolton: That’s pretty consistent with a little increase as you move into the back part of the year, because of the synergies that we talked about on the Post side of the business. But pretty consistent with a little bit of ramping from that.
Dennis McGill: Okay. And then, the number you gave, I want to make sure I got this correctly, the 2.0% blended, that was the fourth quarter number just for legacy MAA?
Eric Bolton: 2% on the rent - sorry, Dennis, I was looking at another side.
Dennis McGill: It’s okay. I think you disclosed 2% blended rent growth. I just want to clarify, that was fourth quarter just for legacy MAA?
Eric Bolton: No, it was for the quarter legacy MAA. It was also January MAA.
Dennis McGill: Okay. And then, just for the fourth quarter then, can you split that between new lease and renewal as well?
Eric Bolton: Yes, sure. So new lease and renewal for MAA for the fourth quarter was renewals were 6.1 and then as expected new leases were about 1.4, so you have a seasonal slowdown there.
Dennis McGill: Yeah. And then also for the fourth quarter, any color you can provide legacy Post as far as Same Store metrics there, revenue, NOI as well?
Eric Bolton: Yeah, sure their revenue was 2.3, occupancy 95.8, and rent growth of 2.2.
Dennis McGill: Okay. And then, just last question, more a big picture, as everyone is trying to get their arms around supply and when it peaks, whether it’s this year, next year, mid-year, late year, et cetera, just curious, Eric, from your perspective, when we think about supply it’s beyond just when it’s delivered. There’s a tail to it. There are some rolling effects that take some time to really get back to something more normal. And wondered from your history and perspective in various markets, how do you think about that tail effect? When a product does come to market, how long does it really take to get back to a balance where the pricing pressure from new lease-ups and then when you cycle those original leases are fully out of the market?
Eric Bolton: Well I mean that how long it takes as a function of how much supply did come into the market, and then sort of how strong the demand side of the equation is, and just obviously ultimately just how strong the absorption is, I think that it’s going to vary, I think that we see nothing at this moment that causes us to believe that the demand side of the equation and demand dynamics are showing any signs of weakening. And so I think that if you take a market other than Houston where the demand side of the equation did in fact collapse, and so you take a market like Houston where it was the demand side of the equation that disrupted the calculus of what was happening in that market that’s a two-year kind of a process, I think, to kind of work through it as you wait for weak demand to take on what supply had been built up. You take a market like say Nashville that’s been getting a lot of supply, but also having great job growth dynamics there. I think Nashville will see broadly is likely going to see a little weaker year this year. But, again, as I was saying earlier the supply side of the equation looks to be showing signs of sort of tapping the brakes, and as long as the demand stay strong. I would think a market like Nashville is back sort of back on its feet in 2018, no problem. So it just varies on those variables a little bit, but I think broadly speaking the markets where we see supply has caused moderation to occur. Absent any disruption on the demand side of the equation and absent any sort of acceleration of supply trends. I think there’s reason to believe that 2018 shows a little more strength in 2017.
Dennis McGill: As you think about 2017 just in from first half, second half, is it fair to say as you guys look at that revenue pressure, most of that has already been felt from supply and you feel like the pricing pressure now has stabilized, which allows you to see pretty stable growth through the year?
Eric Bolton: Well, I think you have to kind of roll through it. We’ve had a number of new lease trends that have been under pressure for a while. And ultimately it starts to have an impact on the renewal pricing as well, but so I think that - I think we’re going to see the pressure really throughout the course of 2017 and then by the time you get to early 2018, I think depending on the market, you could begin to see the pressure lesson. And as we sort of get a new lease pricing back on a healthy trajectory, and new lease prices kind of a leading indicator of what’s happening. And right now the indication generally is more negative than positive, and I think it’s going to take the better part of this year to sort of get that trend reverse.
Dennis McGill: Okay. Sorry, so just last follow-up, I promise, but I want to make sure I understand this correctly, then. If you’re assuming that new lease pressure does take some time through this year, then the fact that revenue growth is stable pretty much through the year is really only a function of the Post synergies, so absent the Post synergies, you’d see deceleration otherwise?
Eric Bolton: Well, yes. I mean, we would definitely see deceleration this year otherwise. There’s no question about it, I think for all the reasons that we’ve just been talking about, I mean new lease truck trends are not as robust this year as they were last year, and ultimately that will mitigate what we’re able to do on renewals at some level. And so I mean the market conditions do suggest deceleration this year, and we are feeling that. And I think that our situation is a little bit unique in that we do see some opportunity in the Post side of the portfolio that probably helps to mitigate some of that pressure and creates, what appears to be a more consistent performance year-over-year.
Dennis McGill: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Dennis.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Conor Wagner: Good morning. On the Post assets, what is the [Technical Difficulty] this year?
Eric Bolton: I’m sorry, Conor, you broke up there. We didn’t hear that question.
Conor Wagner: The impact of redevelopment on the Post assets this year, how much will that contribute to revenue growth in that portfolio?
Albert Campbell: I think about $1 million for the year for the full-year, I think it will take time for that program to ramp up and be as fully productive, as we expect it to be in 2018 and even going forward, but we’ve got, call it $1 million addition in 2017.
Conor Wagner: Great. Thank you. And then what is your guys overall forecast for job growth for the year and how do you see that trending?
Eric Bolton: Well, broadly speaking, it seems like the economists generally are sort of gathering around an expectation of 150,000 to 200,000 jobs added a month, and we continue to believe that our markets in the south east, south west regions will get a good healthy component of that. So on a macro basis, we think that the employment trends in 2017 are pretty consistent to what we’ve been seeing in 2016.
Conor Wagner: Great. Thank you. Then Eric, earlier you talked about taking shareholder capital to markets where you have competitive advantage. How does DC fit into that outlook for you?
Eric Bolton: Well, I also talked about the fact. We’re trying to create a balanced earnings profile and I think that the DC market has dynamics associated with it that are different and offer some diversification for us, and so we’re going to continue to evaluate that market and meanwhile harvest the opportunity that both of those assets that have some redevelopment associated with it and the recovery in that market have to offer harvest that opportunity for capital over the next couple years and then we’ll evaluate from there.
Conor Wagner: Great. Thank you so much.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Conor.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Wes Golladay: Good morning, guys. You mentioned that 14% in Atlanta might be a little too much. What is your optimal limit for a market and over what time do you think Atlanta will get to that level?
Eric Bolton: I would generally tell you that once you get above 10% of the portfolio in a given market. I think it starts to create some nervousness at least on my part. So there is no magic to that. I think to some degree a 10% or 12% allocation in a given market. You have to also look at sort of how you diversify from a price point perspective yet, they look at how you diversify from a submarket perspective, you’ve to look at what is the redevelopment opportunity that may or may not exist in that portfolio. So there is a number of factors that we think about. But I think that once you get to 10% I really start to challenge our thinking a little bit in terms of by doing more in that market and we have to have enough diversification there to support it. but I would think that for us, it’s probably a couple years or so to make that transition.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And looking at some of the one-off assets, it looks like you’re buying into supply. How much competition are you seeing for these assets? Are some of these retrades?
Eric Bolton: Almost every one of them are retrade, and we still see - it’s not, I mean, it’s not as many people in the processes I will say a year or two ago, whereas when a product will come to market there will be 12 people in the tent, now there’s five or seven. But I can’t think of a deal that we bought for the last two years that wasn’t a rebound transaction where the deal had been on a contract before.
Wes Golladay: And what are your thoughts about Houston? Would you buy more into that market now that you’ve reduced your exposure?
Eric Bolton: We would, we would. We believe long in the merits of Houston long-term, its I think a much more diversified market that has been historically obviously still a lot of oil & gas there. But yes, we’ve got capacity to do more Houston should the opportunities present themselves.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks a lot and congrats on closing the merger.
Eric Bolton: Thanks.
Tim Argo: Thanks Wes.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Buck Horne: Hey, good morning, guys. Quick question for me on the balance sheet. Just thinking about now that you’ve closed the deal and successfully you kind of rerated the balance sheet here. Do you think about utilizing a little bit more leverage potentially to drive some acceleration in the growth if you can do so without jeopardizing the new ratings you’ve got? Is there any wiggle room to potentially use a little bit more leverage going forward?
Albert Campbell: Hey, Buck. This is Al. We really want to protect the strength of our balance sheet for sure. We like who we are. It’s big part of our - cost of capital is very important to produce some returns that we need for our investors. So we like that, so no significant change there. I will tell you that this year if you take the amount of investment from the acquisitions we plan to make, funded with dispositions and internal capital. We are leveraging up a little bit, call it, between 50 to 100 basis points, still well below 35% debt to assets. So it’s really very safe place to be. And I’ll tell you as you move into 2018 with development funding likely to decline some that will probably trickle back down a bit as our internal cash flow and earnings growth, internal cash flow picks up and even grows from there. So summary of that is we like where we are. It may fluctuate a little bit around where we are as we execute our business plan, but no significant changes in that.
Buck Horne: Okay. And maybe following that with the internal cash flow you guys are looking to drive this here, how do you think about the payout ratio for the dividends? And maybe longer-term what your target might be for the payout ratio?
Eric Bolton: Well, the way we look at is from a long-term perspective is what sort of growth rate in the dividend do we believe are our business model really supports. And right now the way we think about it, we think that we’ve got a model and a portfolio in place that will sustain sort of a core 6% earnings growth rate over a long period of time. I mean, it will fluctuate a little bit year-over-year, but broadly we think we’ve got a business model supports that kind of 6% growth rate. And ultimately we think that, keeping the payout ratio kind of where it is, then by definition would mean kind of an annualized 6% growth rate in the dividend. Now, as a consequence of some of the things that we’re doing with this Post portfolio and driving down our cost of capital, I mean, we may very well see our growth rate, I hope, start to improve a little bit beyond where it is right now. But ultimately, I think the dividend is more a function - and the growth in the dividend on a sustained recurring basis is more a function of sort of core organic growth rate of earnings that the company is supposed to - you know we don’t think about it so much in terms of payout ratio.
Buck Horne: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take our next question from Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Nicholas Yulico: Thanks. Dallas is one market that screen says is having a fair amount of supply under way. What are concessions like in the market? And are you seeing an impact to your pricing power yet?
Thomas Grimes: Hi, and Dallas is one that I probably should have mentioned as far as having supply come on board. We’re in net effect of rent shop, so the numbers that we have been giving you on our rents have been inclusive of concessions. So I mean you’re seeing some people use them from time to time, half month or a month, something like that. But it is - we’ve had relatively good results in Dallas thus far. But I think that’s one that has - we’ll be facing some supply headwind in 2017.
Nicholas Yulico: Okay, that’s helpful. Just last question, as you think about your Same Store expense guidance this year of 3% to 4%, is that growth likely to come down as you get into 2018 as you get some of the property-level expense synergies from Post? So that let’s just assume here, Same Store revenue growth is the same next year, is this year we’re likely to see better same store NOI growth just from better expense growth?
Eric Bolton: I think it will be two areas you may see it come down, Nick, in the future. One is real estate taxes. If you look at our expenses this year and what our guidance is, all the areas of our expenses other than real estate taxes are well under control. Taxes, which are about 30%, 35% of our operating expenses are the one pressure point, really Texas, Georgia, Tennessee in this year continue to be some pressure in those areas. So I think that’s the one thing to consider. That over time hopefully will come down. And Texas in particular is very aggressive. Think about Texas as backward looking thing. 2016 was a good year, there were a lot of transactions that support a low cap rate, so we expect values to push that. And the other areas we expect to be pretty modest under control. And I do think as we move into 2018, 2019, we will see some capture from the Post side, which will hopefully blend the other areas, repair, maintenance and some of the other areas down as well. So in general, you’re correct with taxes and merger success.
Nicholas Yulico: That’s helpful. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll go ahead and take our next question from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning. It’s Austin Wurschmidt here. Just wanted to touch on acquisitions a bit, and what markets kind of screen to you that you would like to improve your diversification in terms of the balance of A and B product you have or urban-suburban exposure? And then also what does guidance assume in terms of the net contribution from acquisitions? If you could provide any color there, it would be helpful.
Eric Bolton: Well, I’ll take the first one and let Al do the second. In terms of markets where I think that we may see some expansion, some growth and opportunities presents themselves with a market like Charlotte, where we don’t have a lot of exposure to the downtown more urban-oriented centers of Charlotte. Most of our locations are suburban. And a lot of the supply pressure is taking place in Charlotte right now is more of the downtown, fringe downtown areas. So I wouldn’t be surprised to see opportunities come out of that market, that fit the need that we have, somewhat similar story in Raleigh. And then also as Tom mentioned, Nashville is another market that I feel like offers that opportunity. A lot of stuff going on in Nashville right now, downtown, The Gulch area, where we have no exposure to. And we like the performance dynamics of Nashville long term. So those are three that come to mind offhand.
Albert Campbell: I’ll just add the spread for the year is pretty straightforward and simple in our model. We’d start from March through, say, November of the year, pretty even spread, a deal a month, something like that. Also I mean there’s no science to that other than the spread that even as we feel the activity will likely be. And then I’d say, on the disposition side that’s different. We have basically two waves that we expect something midyear and something later in the year, similar to what we did this year. That’s particularly how we do it.
Eric Bolton: And one thing to add on acquisitions, Austin, we’re assuming about 40% of those deals would be these lease-up opportunities that Eric’s talked about. So the blended yield may be perhaps a bit lower than a stabilized yield initially.
Albert Campbell: In 2017, growing 2018 and…
Austin Wurschmidt: That’s helpful. And then are you assuming that those get funded on the line or would you guys look to do a potential bond deal at some point in year to kind of pay - or cover the gap I guess in the dispositions and acquisitions?
Albert Campbell: Yes, initially certainly funded on the line. We look at the line as our liquidity for us to have flexibility move as we want to in acquisitions. And then we move tactically throughout the year to - they have been working perfect. From our maturities to our capital plans, we’ll do one bond deal a year and use our line of credit to manage around that. And so that’s kind of what we are thinking for 2017. We did postponed a deal we’re going to do late last year. That’s kind of just moving into 2017. So we will likely early to mid-year be in the market potentially for fairly large deals to pay down our line of credit and to fund those acquisitions and development.
Austin Wurschmidt: That’s helpful. And then just last one for me. Other income has been an item that has moved Same Store revenue around a bit and been a tailwind at certain points as well as a headwind. What do you assume in terms of growth in other income? And is there any opportunity there within the Post portfolio to drive other income?
Eric Bolton: Broadly, and Tommy add some components to that. Broadly what we see in 2017 is, because of the components of other income, it’s going to grow a little slower than our rent growth. And so that’s why what you saw in the fourth quarter, we had revenue growth of 36. We had effective rent growth of 39. So some of the components of that are cable projects, are utility reimbursement program. They don’t tend to grow as fast or rents to some parts of the cycle. And so, that’s actually taking our revenue going down just a bit in 2017.
Thomas Grimes: And, Jordan, where I would say the opportunity on the revenue side, on the Post is a sort of pricing practices, pricing management. We feel like there’s upside opportunity there despite the market and we believe the redevelopment is a real material opportunity. Those are fundamental and those are long-term, and we’re excited about those opportunities.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer portion. I will now hand it back over to your speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Tim Argo: We don’t have any further remarks. Appreciate everybody for joining the call.
Operator: And that does conclude today’s program. We’d like to thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day and you may disconnect at any time.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-10-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating in the MAA Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, we would like to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin.
Tim Argo: Thank you, David. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, Company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the safe-harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning’s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Tim and good morning. Third quarter results were at the top end of our guidance as solid same store results, which were captured against a record occupancy performance of last year, coupled with favorable trends in G&A and interest expense, drove Core FFO per share of $1.49, representing an 8% jump as compared to Q3 of last year. As outlined in our earnings release, we have raised full year guidance for Core FFO to a range of $5.86 to $5.96 per share. We continue to capture solid leasing trends across the portfolio. Average daily occupancy within the same store portfolio in the third quarter was a very strong 96.4% compared to the likewise very strong 96.5% occupancy in Q3 of last year. Effective rent per unit increased 4.2% with higher performances coming from Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, Charlotte and Fort Worth. As noted in our release, we were successful in closing two acquisitions during Q3, one in Houston and one in Greenville, South Carolina. Both transactions are newly constructed properties and represent compelling long-term investment opportunities for those two markets. We were also successful in completing the disposition of seven older properties in the third quarter as part of our efforts to steadily recycle capital to protect and enhance MAA’s long-term earnings profile. Additionally, we currently have five other properties under contract for disposition and expect to close on these transactions in the fourth quarter. Our merger with Post Properties is making good progress. Both companies have shareholder meetings scheduled for November 10th and we anticipate a closing of the merger effective December 1st. Processes associated with integration of the two companies are well underway with the go-forward organization structure and team members now in place. As outlined in our announcement of the merger, we anticipate that upon completion of integration activities by the end of 2017, we expect to capture overhead synergies of $20 million. Specific line items and decisions associated with capturing this opportunity have been identified and we remain very confident in achieving this performance benchmark. As we continue to engage in the more detailed tasks surrounding the integration of the two companies, we remain very enthused and confident about capturing the improved operating margins and NOI lift from the legacy Post portfolio that is important to the overall value proposition of the merger. Our work to date associated with inventorying and comparing the more detailed operating practices of the two platforms, further assessing opportunities surrounding our larger scale and enhanced market efficiencies and evaluating the redevelopment opportunities, all combine to have us also feeling very confident about this aspect of the value proposition. We will begin to lay out more details upon closing the merger and as part of providing our initial guidance for calendar year 2017. Before turning the call over to Tom I want to express my appreciation and thanks to the associates working at both MAA and Post for their hard work and great support during the past few weeks as we have worked through the difficult task of merging the organizational structures and preparing for consolidated operations, while also taking care of our residents and existing operations. Our newly combined company will have a number of strong attributes that position us well for the future. The professionalism and dedication that our combined team of associates demonstrates each day are key among these qualities. I’ll now turn it over to Tom.
Tom Grimes: Thank you, Eric. And good morning, everyone. Our second quarter NOI performance of 3.7% was driven by revenue growth of 3.6% over the prior year. Revenues were up 1.5% sequentially, which is 30 bps higher than the sequential change last quarter. We have good momentum in rents as all in place effective rents increased 4.2% from the prior year. In the third quarter, new rents and renewal rents executed during the quarter increased 4.3% on a blended lease over lease basis. We achieved 96.4% average daily occupancy which is strong on an absolute basis but slightly lower than last year’s record performance. Fourth quarter trends continued the positive momentum. October’s average daily physical occupancy of 96.1% is in line with October of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period is just 6.6%, below to prior year by 55 basis points. New and renewal rents have built on the strong trends of the third quarter. On a blended lease over lease basis, October rents have increased a seasonally strong 3.3%. On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results. They were led by Fort Worth, Orlando, and Atlanta. The secondary markets continued to close the effective rent growth gap with the large markets. Since the third quarter of 2015, the rent growth gap between large and secondary markets has narrowed 80 basis points. Revenue growth in Jacksonville, Charleston and Memphis all stood out. As mentioned, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy, rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry bead is Houston which represents just 4% of our current portfolio. It’s worth noting that Houston will drop to less than 4% of NOI after the merger. We continue to closely monitor and protect occupancy in this market. As we approach the end of October, Houston’s average daily occupancy is 95.9% and 60-day exposure is just 6.1%. Our customer base remains stable. Move-outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 1.4% over prior year and turnover remained low at 51.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. Move-outs to home buying remained at 20% of total move-outs. There was also little change in move-outs to home rental, which represents just over 7% of move-outs. During the quarter, we completed over 2,400 interior unit upgrades, bringing our total units redeveloped this year to just over 5,400. Our pre-merger redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remains robust. As a reminder, on average, we are spending about $4,500 per unit and receiving average rent increases of approximately $100 over a comparable non-renovated unit, generating a year one cash return of well over 20%. Work is underway defining the scale and scope of the redevelopment opportunity for the Post portfolio. Indications are that it will be a significant value creation opportunity. We are excited about adding units from the Post portfolio to our redevelopment pipeline. Our lease-up communities are performing well. Station Square at Cosner’s Corner II and Cityscape at Market Center II both stabilized on schedule during the third quarter. Rivers Walk II will stabilize on schedule in the fourth quarter. Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes II in Orlando is 30% leased and on schedule to stabilize at the end of next year. Our three new acquisition communities in Tempe, Greenville and Houston are all on track. We are pleased with our progress thus far on the Post merger. The operating structure of the combined companies has been finalized and communicated. There is a high degree of overlap in both systems and markets. We have enjoyed meeting the Post onsite teams and believe that adding these solid teams as well as excellent product and locations to our operating platform will create value for all of our stakeholders. We are in good shape for fourth quarter and set up well for 2017. Al?
Al Campbell: Thank you, Tom. And good morning, everyone. I’ll provide some additional commentary on the Company’s third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet position, and then finally on the revised earnings guidance for the full year. Net income available for common shareholders was $1.12 per diluted common share for the quarter. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.49 per share, which represents 8% increase over the prior year. This performance was $0.04 per share above the mid-point of our previous guidance. Our same store performance continued to be solid, which is in-line with our expectations. About half of the outperformance or $0.02 per share was related to the favorable impact from the timing of our planned bond deal, previously projected for the third quarter, which has been postponed until early next year due to our merger activity and will a little bit more about that in a moment. An additional penny per share is related to the timing of our transaction activity during the quarter, and the final penny per share is related to favorable G&A expenses for the quarter. As Eric mentioned, we acquired two new communities during the third quarter. We invested a total of $133 million for these two new communities, bringing our total acquisition volume year-to-date to $264 million. We also sold seven communities, averaging 22 years of age, during the quarter for gross proceeds of $152 million, which represented a 6.3% cap rate. We also exited two additional secondary markets with these sales, Winston-Salem and Greensboro, North Carolina. Our plans for the year include selling an additional five communities, which are expected to close during the fourth quarter. We completed one community during the quarter, River’s Walk phase II in Charleston, and we had three communities, all expansions of current properties, remaining under construction at the end of the quarter. We funded $13 million of construction costs during the third quarter, and have an additional $33 million to be funded on the existing pipeline. We continue to expect average stabilized NOI yields of about 7.5% for these communities once completed and stabilized. During the third quarter, we paid off $75 million of maturing public bonds, which we expect to refinance as part of a public bond offering early next year. Also during the third quarter, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured rating to BBB+, a stable outlook, and S&P placed our credit ratings currently at BBB flat, on positive Credit Watch to reflect the anticipated increased strength of the balance sheet from the announced Post transaction. Given the merger announcement and related activities, we have postponed our original plans for a bond deal late this year in order to allow the merger to close, which we expect to provide support for a financing early next year. Our balance sheet remains in great shape at quarter-end. Our leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 39.7%, which 100 basis points below the prior year, while our net debt was only 5.6 times recurring EBITDA. At quarter-end, 89% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective interest rate of only 3.9%, with well laddered maturities averaging four years. At quarter end, we had almost $570 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility, providing both strength and flexibility. Given our current expectations for acquisitions and dispositions over the remainder of the year, along with our projection for excess cash, we do not expect any new equity needs other than the shares issues for the merger transaction this year. Also, we expect our leverage to decline upon the closing of the merger with Post, ending the year in the mid-30s as a percent of gross asset value. Finally, as Eric mentioned, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for 2016 due to the stronger than projected performance. We’re increasing our core FFO projection by $0.06 per share at the mid-point, to reflect both the $0.04 per share third quarter outperformance and $0.02 per share for our revised expectations for the remainder of the year. We expect interest expense for the fourth quarter to be about $0.03 per share favorable due to the delayed timing of the planned bond deal, offset by about $0.01 per share of costs relating to cleanup from Hurricane Matthew. We were very fortunate to avoid significant damage from this recent storm, but we will incur some costs during Q4 for repairs and clean-up. Core FFO is now projected to be $5.86 to $5.96 per share, or $5.91 at the midpoint, based on average shares and units outstanding of about 79.7 million. Core AFFO is now projected to be $5.16 to $5.26 per share, or $5.21 at the midpoint. The major components of our guidance, including same store growth, transaction and financing assumptions, remain similar to our prior guidance, with the one exception of the bond deal timing, as discussed. As mentioned in our release, given the merger transaction is not yet approved, this guidance does not reflect the anticipated impact of the transaction. If the transaction closes as planned, we expect to end the year within this current guidance range, although near the lower end given the initial dilution expected from the merger transaction. We expect to provide guidance for 2017 and more details regarding the merger transaction with our fourth quarter press release. As discussed during our merger announcement call, we plan to capture synergies and additional earnings opportunities from the merger with Post that will recapture the initial dilution from the transaction over the first 12 to 18 months, and what we have seen thus far continues to support these expectations. We plan to outline this further with our fourth quarter release. That’s all we have in the way of prepared comments, today. So, now we’ll now turn it over to you for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Eric, help me, help frame the thought process as you go forward between the large markets and the secondary markets in terms of how do you -- it seems like most of the sales keep coming from the secondary markets. Do you turn using the Post platform and do development in some of these secondary markets to maintain the exposure? As this cycle gets late in the tooth because that’s typically been where you’re stability has been during down cycles. Is it just a factor of post Post, you’re going to be much more large markets? I mean how should we be thinking about that as the Mid-America platform moves forward in terms of market distribution?
Eric Bolton: Rob, I will tell you, we remain very committed to the overreaching objective of keeping a diversified and balanced attribute of earning stream. And we think in our region of the country, high job growth region of the country, one of the best ways to create that full cycle profile, if you will, is maintaining a healthy allocation between both large and secondary markets, high growth large and secondary markets. As of today, we have about 65% weighting in large markets and 35% waiting in secondary markets. After the close of the merger, it will be more along the lines of 75-25. Now, you are right and that a lot of the asset sales that have taken place have come out of the secondary markets. But primarily that’s a function of prioritizing disposition focused on older assets where the after CapEx margins are starting to show signs of moderating. And we feel like we can pull money out of those specific properties and recycle into better margin, better growth opportunities. And so, given the history of our Company, it just so happens, a lot of the older assets were in some of the more secondary or tertiary markets. So, just as a consequence of our overall recycling objective, we’ve seen the allocation between large and secondary, and of course the Post transaction is going to change it. I will tell you this going forward, you’ll probably see the 75-25 revert back to closer to call it 60-40 weighting, 65-35 weighting kind of where we are today. We are going to continue to look for opportunistic acquisitions, as well as opportunistic development opportunities in both large and secondary markets as exemplified by this quarter, we bought one Houston, one in Greenville, so we did one in each segment. So, we remain very committed to the whole strategy that has really defined us for the last 20 years. And we will ebb and flow a little bit just as a consequence of recycling and market opportunities. But fundamentally, we don’t plan to change who we are.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then Tom, you talked about the redevelopment in the portfolio. I mean, you guys have done close to 5,500 units in the existing Mid-America portfolio. When you look forward to 2017, 2018, 2019, assuming the market’s cooperative and no recession et cetera, what’s the remaining opportunity in the core Mid-America portfolio? And then, I know it’s early but what’s the magnitude of the number of units that you think are appropriate within the existing Post portfolio to do the rehab on?
Tom Grimes: Sure. On the MAA side, Rob, we’ve got north of 15,000 units remaining and we’d expect to see next year in the range of what we did this year. We’re really working through, we’re in the sweet spot of the Colonial portfolio at this point. On the Post side, it is still early, but we are very excited about those locations and how the interiors of those units will line up against the market norms in those locations and what that opportunity is. And so, I would tell you right now, it looks like it’s 10,000 units or better.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird & Company. Your line is open.
Drew Babin: Following on Rob’s question on redevelopment opportunities within Post, would you expect that some of the assets might find themselves kind of on the development and redevelopment page in the supplemental, as kind of more impactful redevelopments or do you envision the renovations being more kind of the kitchen and bath on turnover type projects?
Eric Bolton: There would be the kitchen and bath on turn opportunities. We are pretty disciplined about that and will likely not do a full -- evict everybody or ask people politely to move out and take the whole units down. We feel like that maximizes the opportunity. Now there are inside of that that’s what we call heavy and a light, and there’ll be some opportunities to do some granite and stainless upgrade as well as some light fixture changes as well, meaning just doing floors and fixtures and some items like that. But we’re still mapping out those opportunities, but really excited about the conditions of property and the locations and the opportunity there.
Drew Babin: And on the disposition side, the 6.3 which I assume is an economic cap rate on what was sold in the third quarter. Would that be a good run rate kind of modeling dispositions going forward? Obviously it’s much lower cap rates than some of the assets that have been sold over the last few quarters. Obviously, the remaining assets would be of higher quality, which we feel confident underwriting that type of disposition yield in the next year?
Tom Grimes: I would say so, yes. Yes. The five that we’ve got on the contract, if all proceeds as we expect, there will be similar cap rate achieved on those.
Drew Babin: Okay. And finally, the 4.3% blended rent increase in 3Q, can you break that out by renewals and new leases?
Tom Grimes: Yes, sure. That was -- let’s see, it was on third quarter, it was 2.4 and 6.6.
Operator: We’ll take our next question form Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi. Good morning. It’s Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just sticking on the Post transaction, as you’ve come through that portfolio, how are you thinking about asset sales on the combined portfolio into 2017, and particularly interested in maybe some markets where you are going to have a much bigger presence for example in Atlanta? And then, I’d also be interested in any updated thoughts on what you’re intending to do with the DC, either keep or potentially selling those assets?
Eric Bolton: Well, I would tell you that we are just really starting to dig in a lot on our plans regarding portfolio, any sort of capital recycling that we’re going to be doing and putting our plans together for next year and really for the next three years. I would tell you that probably my biggest priority exist on recycling some capital probably out of Dallas and Atlanta. Those two markets are going to comprise a fairly healthy percentage of overall portfolio concentration and that both would be a little bit higher than I think we want to maintain over the long haul. So, there’ll probably be some recycling opportunity in those two markets would be a more for a priority for us. DC, we were up there last week and starting to really understand more about that opportunity. As I think you know the DC market is starting to finally show some signs of recovery. And bottom line is we are going to be patient with our analysis and thinking about what to do up there. We think that holding on to those assets at this point makes a lot of sense, particularly given where we are in the recovery cycle of that market and things that they bring, again different earnings profile element to the portfolio with our objective of really aiming to create balance on our earnings stream. We think those assets are good for the portfolio at this point.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks or the detail there. And then just any other opportunities as you start to dig in? You mentioned integration is well underway and might not have been as obvious when you completed your initial underwriting either on the operational side, revenue management related?
Eric Bolton: Well, again, we’ll get into more specifics as we get the transaction closed and we start to put out our 2017 guidance. We’re really digging in on the mechanics of the details, policies and practices on everything from how we manage and utilize LRO overall to how we manage and turn apartments to everything. And I would just say that we feel very optimistic about what we’re seeing at this point and feel very confident in the overall value proposition.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. And then just last question for me. On the Houston acquisition, just curious about how you guys underwrote that and how you’re thinking about market rent growth in Houston over the next, call it 12 to 18 months?
Eric Bolton: Well, this is a very opportunistic situation which presented to us off market with the developer and capital equity partner that we know very well, we’ve done business with over the past. They were motivated to cycle out of the investment. Houston Heights district is a very high-end area, just northwest of downtown, the 3 miles northwest of the CBD of Houston, very restrictive covenants about supply in this particular sub-market back. In fact, this is the first community delivered in that sub-market since 2008, which is saying something when you’re talking about Houston. But we went in there very conservatively. We basically assumed no rent growth for the next two years, 1.5% rate growth in the third year. I believe Houston will likely do better than that, but that’s what we assumed. And on that basis, it underwrote at a level that we felt pretty good about, 5, 6 stabilized NOI yield first year, based on what I consider to be kind of probably lower rents than certainly what we’ll see long-term. So, we feel, it was a pretty opportunistic buy, at this point.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Robert Wagner with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.
Conor Wagner: This is Conor. Good morning, guys. So, Bob couldn’t be with us today. Overall, Eric, if you could continue commenting on Houston. Have you seen other deals where, I know you guys have been looking there for a while where sellers have been less willing or just overall the transaction margin. Is this deal indicative that the transaction market in Houston is opening up or sellers still trying to wait for better pricing?
Eric Bolton: I think it’s probably not indicative of where the market is right now, Conor. I think that, as you say, we have been looking at a lot of opportunity trying to chase opportunity there for last couple of years and haven’t really found. We think a few transactions take place, but not much. And this was just the unique situation that was presented to us, and we jumped on it. I think that everybody is fully aware that supply trends and new permitting trends pulled way back in Huston. And I think we’ve got to get through 2017. But I think, anybody that’s got the wherewithal and ability and/or the interest in holding on to 2018 is going to do that. So, I think Huston, we’re going to continue to keep an eye on that market and like it long-term. But I think that it’s probably too early to suggest that this transaction is indicative of anything really turning there in terms of transaction activity.
Conor Wagner: And then, you mentioned supply, the supply issue in Houston. Any markets next year where you are most concerned about supply growth versus any markets where supply growth pictures becomes more favorable?
Tom Grimes: No, Conor. I think in general we’re seeing that 2017 looks a lot like 2016 in terms of supply that developers are beginning to have trouble with financing our lining items up in that area and then it probably peaks in 2017 and backs off in 2018. As Eric mentioned, Huston deliveries will be roughly half, will see half of the levels that they were this year and Atlanta, Dallas and Nashville will see modest increases but job growth remains very strong in that area and then really the reminder are in line with 2016.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Your line is open.
Tom Lesnick: I guess first, and I am sorry if I missed this. But Tom, could you maybe provide the renewal and new lease over lease comps for both your primary and secondary as well your overall performance?
Tom Grimes: Yes. It’s 2.4 and 3.1 for the third quarter. And give me just second, I’ll get it for large and secondary. Did you have another question while we’re just having the primary and secondary?
Tom Lesnick: Yes, actually yes. So, on the on the Colonial transaction, you guys included the debt mark-to-market add back in your definition of core FFO, and some of that’s still tapering off. Do you guys have any estimates of what that would be based on where rates are on today on the Post portfolio?
Al Campbell: Tom, we do. We’ve talked about that a little bit. I’ll tell you, I think a bigger point is we’re really looking at how we’re going to handle that this transaction given all the -- there is a lot f discussion in industry about non-core measures and handling of that. SEC is very focused on that and of course the REIT industry is right in the bull’s eye on that. So, I think what you’re seeing, we’re going to take a look at that and most likely what we’re going to do going forward next year is focus more NAREIT FFO and discuss the transaction merger integration cost. So that means that the fair market value adjustment will be included in that instead of pulling it out as for core FFO. I think our peers do include that, we’re going to go ahead and do that and line that up within NAREIT FFO. Having said that, I think the number is around 35 million, something like that in total that we talked about and we’ll get more details on that when we give guidance for 2017.
Tom Grimes: Alright and then Tom -- sorry, go ahead, Tom.
Tom Lesnick: No, I was just saying I got that. I appreciate it. And so the comps?
Tom Grimes: Yes. For the third quarter, the large market growth was 3% on new lease and 7% on renewal and secondary is 1.5% on new lease and 6% on renewal.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Tayo Okusanya: Along the lines of the Post merger, apart from the $25 million of synergies that you guys have talked about. You’ve also kind of now talked about these redevelopment opportunities within the portfolio. Anything else you are targeting out there that should give investors much more confidence about the amount of synergies overall they could get from the deal over a two to three-year holding period?
Eric Bolton: Well, I would tell you, Tayo. First, let me make sure it’s 20 million of overhead, not 25, but 25 was on Colonial, 20 on Post. But as far as the areas of opportunity and sort of the opportunity to recover earnings solution. First of all, it’s important to recognize that we’re taking on the Post portfolio. And what’s going to happen is the dilution that we see will be frankly at its highest point at the very first month or two and then it begins to taper off over the coming 12 to 18 months. And so, we think that by the time we get to the end of 2017 that the recovery associated with overhead synergy that $20 million number would be fully realize by the time we get to the end of 2017. Beyond that, there are really three other sort of big areas of opportunity, first and foremost is the development pipeline that Post has. Again, we’re taking that development pipeline on at frankly its most dilutive point. And, we will see as these properties come online and the earnings contributions start to grow, that will start to really show up, really towards end of next year and really into 2018 as these construction projects finish. But that’s going to be a meaningful area of opportunity. Thirdly is what Tom was talking about a moment ago, the redevelopment. That’s a two to three year process. We see tremendous opportunity there, these are terrific locations that we think are just absolutely right for our redevelopment program. And we think that potentially is going to be much more significant frankly than what we contemplated that going into this. And then finally, the fourth area is we just refer to it generally as NOI lift. And it’s a combination of a bunch of things. It ranges all the way from how we execute with LRO, yield management practices, as I was saying earlier, how we turn apartments, capturing the full benefit, surrounding the scale that we have. And frankly those benefits regarding scale and efficiencies, there is going to be some benefit accrued to the existing legacy MAA portfolio as a consequence of this combination as well. So that particular opportunity is still being mapped out in detail, but we think that over the next 12 to 18 months that it likewise is a very significant opportunity. When you pull it all together, I mean when you look at sort of the -- there is a lot of different ways to think about sort of the value proposition here. But certainly, when you look at the pricing pay versus the upside that we think it’s going to be realized over the next couple of years or so. Much in the same way we saw with Colonial, we think this one here with Post is going to be frankly more upside than what we saw with Colonial.
Tayo Okusanya: And then just one more for the road. Just in regards to some of your secondary markets, there was also some weak same-store NOI growth there, Savannah, San Antonio, Greenville, and Birmingham. How should we be -- sorry, Birmingham and Little Rock, Arkansas. How should we be kind of thinking about those markets since we don’t really talk much about but some of their numbers are also pretty weak?
Tom Grimes: I would tell you, I mean it’s little bit different stories on some, on those first couple that you mentioned. They have very strong on year-over-year occupancy growth this time last year and tapered out a little bit. But Savannah, we feel good about long term. Their job growth is north of 2%. They’re managing through some deliveries in the pooler submarket. But frankly that has become an aviation aerospace hub, almost smaller version of Charleston. And then Little Rock and Birmingham, I think they continue to improve but limited supply there and job growth in recovery mode, but they do not have quite the strengthened job growth that place Savannah, Charleston and Greenville do.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Gaurav Mehta: Following up on your comments on redevelopment opportunities within the Post portfolio, I was wondering if you could comment on your thoughts on using the Post brand. And on the merger call, you said that you’re still evaluating how you’re going to do the integration with different brands. Is there any update on that?
Eric Bolton: We’re -- that’s something we’re going to be very careful with and very thoughtful about. We think that the Post brand has value. We think it’s particularly important in the Atlanta market. We are going to -- you’ll see no change initially whatsoever. All the Post property names will continue just as they are. And we have no near-term plans to modify anything along these lines. But over the course of the coming year, we will be looking at opportunities to get a little bit alignment, some degree of alignment between sort of the Post brand and the MAA brand and see if we can come up with something that makes sense. But above all, we’re absolutely committed to doing all we can to protect the I think very high rating that the Post brand maintains in a number of markets, Dallas included but particularly Atlanta I think is very important, and as well strengthen in a lot of the markets we’re. So more to come on that but we understand the value of the brand and we’re interested and want to be certain that we don’t lose that.
Gaurav Mehta: And I think you highlighted Atlanta and Dallas as the couple of markets where you maybe overallocated Post merger and you may plan to recycle capital, are there any markets Post merger that you feel you’re underallocated and where you plan to put that capital?
Eric Bolton: Well frankly, I mean really just about any other market that we’re in at the moment, has capacity, if you will. So, we’re going to continue to -- all existing markets that we’re in, continue to look for opportunities. I think we will continue to as we have talked about with our recycling effort, we will continue to look at older assets, we still have a few. But not much left in that regard, but we have a couple one-off opportunities here and there that we will probably look at next year. But I think overall, the markets that we are in and certainly we like them and we would be happy to recycle capital in any of those markets.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.
Neil Malkin: First, some anecdotal evidence relative to single-family homes and trends. It seems like the first-time homebuyers that data is at pretty high levels or is accelerating. So, I am wondering if particularly in your secondary markets you are seeing any pressure on moveouts due to home purchase, any type of that activity going on just given the price point of your assets?
Tom Grimes: We’re not and actually in our secondary markets group, there is lower -- the home buying, moveouts to home buying lower in secondary markets than in the large markets group. So, nothing there.
Neil Malkin: And then other one, you have been sending out or receiving pretty good renewal increases relative to new leases -- new lease rate increases, I am wondering at the current time, what -- is there a gain or loss at least in your portfolio and how do you look at the balance or the marriage between the two to not get too ahead of the market?
Tom Grimes: Yes. So, the way we really look at it is that we monitor the gap between the absolute dollar value of the renewal and the absolute dollar value of the new lease and what you find is it has some seasonal attributes to it. And so, it is -- it will be as little as $2 or $3 in the summer months when leasing is full bore. And then, as it begins to wind down and it’ll open up to about $25 at this point. But right now, the way that it works is just in general at some point, if those become divergent and stay that way, it inhibits new lease price growth. But the dollar value between the two has remained narrow for the last couple of years and thus we’re continuing to be aggressive on renewals.
Neil Malkin: I guess another way, if you were to reset all of your leases to market, would you roll up or down?
Tom Grimes: We’d up roll up another 3.5% to 4% loss to lease in our portfolio right now….
Neil Malkin: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take our last question from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Buck Horne: My quick first question actually was on the renewal numbers as well, that 6.6 seems pretty strong. Maybe a little color on it, just how did it trend throughout the quarter, if there was any significant change from month-to-month? And maybe what you’re going out with on renewal offers for November and December?
Tom Grimes: I mean what we’re doing -- that has stayed pretty steady as it goes, to be honest with you Buck. Renewals have been a bright spot for us for some time. August was 6.5, September was 5.9, October 6.2 and then you know the fourth quarter will be a hair lower than that, upper 5s just because we try not to force, we try not to force as little turnover as possible in the slower months. But frankly our lease expiration management was in very good shape, which has allowed us to continue to ask for what will work. I mean we have great customer service on site and markets are reasonable. So, we continue to work successfully with the renewals at that time.
Buck Horne: Sounds good. And my last question is on costs, a little bit. Maybe Al, if you could help us. Understand some of the movements, maybe start with the real estate taxes and so, explain -- a little bit of a comp issue in this quarter, and it looks like the guidance is forecasting for the fourth quarter to be a little bit easier for you on real estate tax pressure. Maybe just also if you foresee any other items coming up over the coming year, particularly maybe personnel costs; are you seeing any pressure on personnel to retain on site teams or anything like that?
Al Campbell: Well, I guess it’s a good question and real estate taxes, I think it’s important to focus on exactly what you did at the full year, the guidance we put out is 5.5%, 6.5%, don’t expect that the change. Taxes, you get a lot of volatility sometimes in quarterly comparisons because there’s couple of things that happen and you get -- timing of getting your information during the year can change year to year and timing of getting appeals successful or not successful can change year to year. So, I think the story for the third quarter is that last year in third quarter, we got a lot of information and some favorable appeals that were very favorable and really helped us understand. As so, we are facing a tough comp this year, third quarter, but our trajectory for the whole year is much more stable this year. Every bit of information we’ve gotten seems to support our initial expectation. And so we feel good about the 5.6 to 6.5 and pressure coming from the same places we talked about, in Texas, in Georgia as they aggressively chase value of some of those areas and have a lot of transactions to support it. So, that’s really what’s going on in there. Another is no, we really don’t expect at this point a lot and the pressure going to fourth quarter. In terms of our -- what we’ve put out and what’s in our guidance continued expense in personnel, continued expense in other areas in line with what our expectations were. So, it’s nothing new. Only unusual item we think of right now, mentioned a little bit, little bit storm cost cleanup in fourth quarter, Hurricane Matthew, certainly very fortunate that we’ll have little bit cost in the fourth quarter to clean that up but other than that, nothing unusual we found to be expected.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time.
Eric Bolton: Okay. Well, thanks nothing else from management at this point. And we’ll see a lot of you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-07-31 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating in the MAA Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, we’d like to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Leo. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO, Al Campbell, our CFO, and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out, that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the safe-harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning’s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. When we reach the question and answer portion of the call, I would ask for everyone to please limit their questions to no more than two, in order to give everyone ample opportunity to participate. Should you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue or you are certainly welcome to follow up with us after we conclude the call. Thank you. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. As outlined in yesterday’s earnings release, second quarter results were ahead of expectations. Solid rent growth, supported by occupancy that matched last year’s strong results, generated same store net operating income that was ahead of our forecast. Core FFO per share of $1.49 was at the top-end of our guidance with the favorable NOI performance driving the majority of the outperformance for the quarter. It’s also worth noting that Core AFFO was $1.25 per share for the second quarter, or 16% ahead of the second quarter of last year. As a result of the better than expected second quarter performance, combined with our outlook that leasing conditions over the rest of the year will support continued solid rent growth and strong occupancy, we’ve raised the expectation for Core FFO for the full year. As discussed in our first quarter call, it’s important to keep in mind the record level of occupancy that was captured in the back half of last year, particularly in the third quarter, that will serve as this year’s comparative benchmark. But, to be clear, we anticipate the current strong occupancy and pricing trends will continue. For the full year we continue to believe that we will capture average physical occupancy at 96.2%, slightly ahead of last year’s record performance at 96.1%, while also driving solid rent growth that supports the year-over-year gains in revenue leading to our increased expectations for the same store NOI growth. Al will walk you through the more detailed assumptions in his comments covering our revised and increased guidance for both same store NOI and Core FFO. Same store operating metrics remain strong with resident turnover in the second quarter down 4.6% as compared to the second quarter of last year. Daily physical occupancy averaged 96.2% throughout the quarter matching last year’s strong performance. Effective rent per unit increased 4.4% over the second quarter of last year and was up 1.4% on a sequential basis, with all of our markets registering both positive year-over-year and sequential rent growth with the exception of Houston which was down slightly by 0.2%. Tom will give you some additional insights on the operating trends we are seeing as well as outline performance differences across our markets. Overall, we are encouraged with the continued levels of growing demand that is clearly keeping pace with new supply delivery across our diversified portfolio and balanced sub-market strategy. We continue to work through a very robust acquisition pipeline with deal flow running well ahead of last year. As outlined in the earnings release, we were successful in the second quarter with the acquisition of a new property in its initial lease-up in the Phoenix, Arizona MSA. This particular acquisition is a good example of the sort of opportunities we target involving a new lease-up development with a local developer and motivated capital that enables both our operating and transaction execution capabilities to capture a high-quality opportunity at a price that we believe will add to future value per share. We expect to capture a stabilized NOI yield in the 6% range on this high-end new property once we complete the lease-up and execute on other opportunities associated with onsite operations and revenue management practices. As new supply continues to come on line in a number of our markets, we’re optimistic that additional opportunities will be captured later this year. So in summary, we like the market trends we are seeing and the MAA team has the operating platform executing well, the balance sheet is in terrific shape and our transaction pipeline is very busy. With that I’ll now turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Grimes: Thank you Eric and good morning everyone. Our second quarter NOI performance of 5.7% was driven by revenue growth of 4.4% over the prior year and 1.2% sequentially. We have good momentum in rents as all in place effective rents increased 4.4% from the prior year. In the second quarter, new rents and renewal rents executed during the quarter increased 5% on a blended lease over lease basis. We also matched the strong average occupancy of the prior year. Overall same store expenses remain in line, up just 2.3%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry leading initiatives, such as our vendor owned shop stocking program and our interactive marketing strategy, have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check. Third quarter trends continue the positive momentum. Average daily physical occupancy of 96.2% is in line with July of last year. Our 60 day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60 day period is just 7%, below our prior year by 50bps. New and renewal rents have built on the strong trends of the second quarter. On a blended lease over lease basis, our July rents increased 4.3% and early indications are that August will increase to 5%. On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Phoenix and Atlanta. The secondary markets continued to close the effective rent growth gap with the large markets. Since the third quarter of 2015, the rent growth gap between large and secondary markets has narrowed 60 basis points. Revenue growth in Jacksonville, Greenville, and Charleston stood out. As mentioned, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy, rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry bead is Houston which represents just 3.4% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. As we approach the end of July, our Houston market’s daily occupancy is 95.2% and 60 day exposure is just 6.6%. Move outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 4.6% over the prior year and turnover remained low at 51.5% on a rolling twelve month basis. Move outs to home buying were down 1%. Move outs to home rental, which represent just over 7% of our total move outs, were down 5%. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupants again paid off, and we were able to reduce by one day the average vacancy between occupants which helped drive the second quarter average physical occupancy to 96.2%. During the quarter we completed over 1,800 interior unit upgrades, bringing our total units redeveloped this year to just over 3,200. We expect to redevelop over 5,000 units this year. Our redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 - 20,000 units remains robust. As a reminder, on average we are spending about $4,500 per unit and receiving average rent increases of approximately $100 over a comparable non-renovated unit, generating a year one cash return of well over 20%. Our lease-up communities are performing well. Station Square at Cosner’s Corner II closed the quarter at 99% occupancy. Cityscape at Market Center II is leasing well. They are currently 95.6% occupied and expected to stabilize on schedule in the third quarter of this year. Rivers Walk II in Charleston is 71% leased and Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes II in Orlando is 18% leased, both are on schedule. Our second quarter acquisition, Residences at Fountainhead in Phoenix, Arizona is currently 78% occupied. At the midpoint of our summer season we are on track and the portfolio is performing very well, Al.
Albert Campbell: Thank you Tom and good morning everyone. I’ll provide some additional commentary on the company’s second quarter earnings performance and balance sheet activity and then finally on revised earnings guidance for the full year. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.49 per share, which represents a 10% increase over the prior year. Performance was $0.05 per share above the mid-point of our previous guidance. About two thirds or $0.03 per share, of this outperformance for the quarter was related to favorable property operating results, primarily due to operating expenses, as both personnel and marketing costs were better than expected for the quarter. Remaining $0.02 per share was primarily related to gains on casualty insurance claims settled during the quarter, as shown on the reported income statement. Strong rental pricing and continued high occupancy levels carried through the quarter, as expected, supporting the earnings performance. As Eric mentioned, we acquired one new community during the second quarter, Residences at Fountainhead, located in Phoenix, for a total investment of 69.5 million. The community was in lease-up when acquired, and was 75.8% occupied at quarter-end. As Tom mentioned, lease-up continues to progress well, and we expect the community to complete its initial lease-up early next year. During the second quarter we sold three parcels of commercial land and the remaining commercial JV property originally acquired in the Colonial merger for total proceeds of about 4.5 million, producing the small gains on sale of non-depreciable and depreciable assets reflected on the income statement for the quarter. We had four communities, all phase II expansions of current properties, remaining under construction at the end of the quarter. We funded 16.1 million toward completion during the second quarter, and have an additional 48 million of the 97 million total projected cost remaining to be funded. We continue to expect stabilized NOI yields of 7.0% to 7.5% on average for these communities once completed and stabilized. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. At quarter-end our, our leverage, defined as Net Debt to Gross assets, was 40.7%, 70 basis points below the prior year, while our Net Debt was only 5.7 times Recurring EBITDA. At quarter-end, 92% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective interest rate of only 3.8%, with well laddered maturities averaging 4.7 years. At quarter end we had almost $600 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility providing both strength and flexibility for growth. Given our current expectations for acquisitions and dispositions over the remainder of the year, along with our projection for excess cash of 90 million to 95 million representing FAD less all dividends, we do not anticipate new equity needs this year and we expect to end the year with our leverage slightly below current levels. Finally, as Eric mentioned, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for 2016 due to the stronger than projected performance. We’re increasing our Core FFO projection by $0.04 per share at the mid-point, to reflect both the $0.05 per share second quarter outperformance and our revised expectations for real estate taxes for the year, now expected to cost us an additional $0.01 per share over the remainder of the year, as valuations, mainly in Texas, came in a bit higher than expected. Our forecast generally continues to be based on our current strong occupancy levels carrying through the year, with the toughest comps in the third quarter, combined with pricing performance continuing in the 4% to 4.5% range. Core FFO is now projected to be $5.77 to $5.93 per share, or $5.85 at the midpoint, based on average shares and units outstanding of about 79.6 million. Core AFFO is now projected to be $5.07 to $5.23 per share, or $5.15 at the midpoint, which produces a strong 64% AFFO payout ratio for the year. We also increased our same store NOI guidance to an expected range of 4.75% to 5.25% for the full year, based on higher revenue growth increased range to 4.0% to 4.5% and lower operating expense growth decreased range to 2.5% to 3.5%, which includes the impact of higher real estate taxes, now projected to grow 5.5% to 6.5% compared to the prior year. The other major components, including transaction and financing assumptions remain similar to our previous guidance. That is all we have in the way of prepared comments, so Leo we will now turn the call back to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question comes from John Kim, BMO. Your line is open.
John Kim: Some of your markets have significant new supply expected over next few years, markets like Nashville, Charlotte and Austin where there is supposed to be about 9% new supply at least. And I know lot of this new delivery doesn't really compete with your asset directly, but I am just wondering if there are any markets that concern you as far as too much supply coming to market?
Eric Bolton: Yeah, I mean not at this point John. In Charlotte and Austin are good ones to talk about and I mean, they both have been delivering fairly high level of supply. I Charlotte that is quite isolated to sort of the urban core where just three of our assets are expect Charlotte to continue to be strong. In Austin, the development has largely been scattered most concentrated in the down town area but scattered across the MSA but it is largely you know will have a property to house a little bit of pressure from a single asset going up across the street then it will abate and honestly we have seen sort of similar things in Dallas as well but I think overall the fundamental line situation of strong job growth is continuing and it is allowing us to work through this deliveries.
John Kim: In this period you had revenue growth accelerate in Phoenix, Tampa and Dallas. I was wondering over the next 12 months what markets you're most bullish on, where you see revenue growth accelerate.
Eric Bolton: I think those and Orlando probably fit the bucket for us.
John Kim: Okay great, thank Eric.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Rich Anderson: Thanks, good morning. Good quarter, of course. So, you're kind of putting up a positive spin on new supply coming online because it opens up acquisition opportunities as you described Eric. How should we think about that? I mean, is the supply picture to you currently a positive consideration or are you just trying to eke out some positives out of a negative consideration?
Eric Bolton: No, I think - I mean obviously supply in a market brings into question, your ability to raise rents and just operating fundamentals but as Tom was just going through there, I mean as we look at it today, permitting across our portfolio in 2017, is forecast to be down 10% from what it is this year. So on balance given the strong job environment that we continue to see across our region from an operating perspective while we are not getting the sort of trends that we saw two years ago, we are still doing very well and as we try to emphasize the trends that we’ve seen strong early this year. We expect those trends to continue, so from an operating perspective we are not nervous about supply trends at this point but -
Rich Anderson: I guess - of course, supply is a risk, I get that. But I was just wondering if there is an optimal amount of supply that gives you these acquisition opportunities and if you actually welcome some level to see -
Eric Bolton: Yeah, we do. I mean on the acquisition side of the equation, yeah absolutely right and what we liked to see particularly is more supply, comes on line particularly when it is concentrated and certain sub market and so forth which would often tends to be. We often see situations where like the situation I described that we just acquired in Phoenix where, you know so local developers or third party managed situation, they are really not in the business of leasing operating in a manner similar to what we are able to do and you through a little supply pressure into that sub market where they are trying to eke out the leas up, yeah, pressure mounts and buying opportunities emerge out of that. I mean all the deals that we acquired over the past year or so are very much along these lines where there leased up situations and we have got four or five deals on the hopper right now that we are underwriting pretty aggressively that are all very much along the same line. So I continued to feel that as over the next three or four quarters that we are going to see some good opportunities.
Rich Anderson: And then just, my second question is, do you feel like there is some sort of new paradigm emerging here? Obviously, your portfolio has always been thought to be low barrier, high-risk supply markets, offset by job growth, but the story today is a lot of urban development and maybe a causal factor to EQR’s [ph] problems. Do you expect this to reverse back to more normalized conditions where you know your markets become the centerpiece of supply risk or do you think that there's something changing in your world that actually makes you a little bit more supply - more tefloned [ph] I guess?
Eric Bolton: Rich, I don’t know, I will say this, you know we have always gone at this with a belief that we are trying to build a portfolio in markets and in sub markets and at price point that offer us the ability and you have heard me say this for years, outperform over the full cycle and you know market fats come and go, cap rates come and go but we are not driven by those things. We are driven by recurring cash flow, we deploy capital with that thought, we allocate capital across the region with that thought. We like the strong job growth metrics of the South East markets, we can’t do anything about supply per say other than just be sure we got a very competitive platform and that we know how to operate very aggressively. And basically we feel like we can compete with anybody and we can compete superior to a lot of people we compete within these markets. So the supply will do what it does, what I really more focused on is being sure we deploy capital where demand is going to be and we think that demand is largely a function of job growth and economic growth and we like the South East for that reason.
Rich Anderson: Right, so I guess - I was thinking maybe lenders are exercising different standards to providing debt financing to developers and maybe that's something that's changing, but maybe not, I guess so -
Eric Bolton: It will change it comes and goes, right now for sure, they are probably nervous about funding a lot of construction in urban core areas.
Rich Anderson: Right, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Nick Joseph of Citigroup. Your line is open.
Nick Joseph: Thanks, Al, I'm wondering if you can give little more detail on the underlying assumptions that go into the back half of the year for same-store revenue growth guidance. You did 4.9% in the first half, the back half at the mid-point assumes 3.6% growth. You mentioned rent growth should be maintained at about 4% to 4.5%. There's the occupancy headwind of about 20 basis points. So, what else is driving or what are the other headwinds there to get from maybe that 4% down to the 3.6% implied by guidance?
Albert Campbell: Yeah, Nick sure I can give you some color on that. As personally just underlying what you mentioned we are not projecting the core fundamentals to decelerate in the back half and the core fundamentals for us are occupancy that would continue at the record 96.2 and the pricing growth. We expect to be in the 4% to 4.5%, we are certainly seeing that and expect to just to continue to see that through the back half. As you compare back to the prior year, the top of the comps are more difficult in two years, primarily third quarter and both the occupancy and your fees. Our fees and reimbursements that we have in our program that is a $30 million line item. So you put those two things together, that is getting you from 4% to 4.5% growth rate down to the 3.5% to 4% that is projected over the back half of the year. That is just you know math related to the comps to comps last year but the fundamentals of the business is strong and we expect that to continue.
Nick Joseph: Thanks, but what's a good run rate for fee growth going forward?
Albert Campbell: I would say that the issue with it for the back half is it was growing those two lines together we are growing comp of 7% to 8% last year. This year in to the future 3% more of a normalized growth rate, it is just last year as we are building occupancy, we just had as we talked about has it very end, we get capturing the final vestiges was called the Colonial, we had a very strong performance in those line items. So comparing back of 7% growth rate yielding torpidity long term is just not 3% something in the normal range as what we expect and it is pretty big line items that cause in the comparison.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. For those assumptions, are there any differences between what you're expecting from the large markets versus secondary markets?
Eric Bolton: On occupancy the headwind on the secondary is greater in the third quarter. Now it’s not that much Nick, pretty consistent with the transfer seeing right now.
Operator: Our next question is from Jordan Saddler of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan, touching a little bit on next question, building off of that, I mean, turnover is really down again this quarter. Do you feel like you've taken your foot off the gas at all on rental rate growth given trying to manage a little bit of the more difficult occupancy comps you face in the back half the year? And then could you also give us what the rental rate growth was last year for July and August?
Eric Bolton: Answering your first question, no we don’t think we have taken the foot off the gas at all. Turnover for move outs to rent increase moved from 14% of our move outs to 13%. So that is immaterial and we are getting 6.5% rent growth on that we feel pretty good about that and have it backed off at all on that. And then remind me your second question Austin.
Austin Wurschmidt: Yeah, just comparing the 4.3% increase you got in July and the 5% you expect in August, what were those numbers last year?
Eric Bolton: They were in the range last year, we will dig in for numbers, going increase over last year, it is within 50 basis points last year on appointed basis.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay, thanks for that and then just, what is the average occupancy assumption you've got for the second half of the year?
Albert Campbell: 96.2% and following on Nick’s point, I think we have a record high of 96.6% in the third quarter last year, call it some of that, I think back half of the year, last year was 96.4% given there.
Austin Wurschmidt: So, you'd say that occupancy will be a headwind sort of 20 basis points in the back half of the year?
Albert Campbell: Slight headwind just from the comp, but we have a very strong still 96.2% for the year is a record level, it is actually 10 basis points above 96.1% that was record level last year, so that is how we look at, we are going to continue strong occupancy, continue push price and we believe that forecast back half is good.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay, thanks for taking the question.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Gaurav Mehta of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Gaurav Mehta: Hi, good morning. Just going back to transactions, I was wondering if you could touch upon disposition, what you're seeing in the market and what's the timing of the sales of assets?
Eric Bolton: Well we are currently actually working on number of those transaction, we actually have seven properties currently in contract that we are working through due diligence on and we would expect assuming everything plays out as we think it will expect to close on those of those - most of those in the third quarter with the others probably in Q4.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay. And then going back to acquisition, I was wondering if you could comment on - if you've seen any distressed product in the market as a result of tightening lending standards?
Eric Bolton: Not really, what we are seeing are more evidence that some of the lease up velocity that was taking place last year, some of these new properties is slowing a little bit and so some of the properties are brought up out of the ground early this year that sort of get to that 50%, 60%, 70% leased status, that’s typically where you start to run into the most headwind, we have more of those in the market today and therefore, that’s where our belief that we will see more opportunities, that’s where that originates from.
Gaurav Mehta: And I guess last follow up. Are there any markets where you're seeing more of that product or its market wide in your markets?
Eric Bolton: It is pretty consistent across the board. I wouldn’t point anything unique, we are seeing, mean Houston is a market where folks have been focused on trying to find some great buying opportunities but we continue to see pretty front pricing in that market. So it is pretty consistent across the board.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay thanks for taking my questions.
Eric Bolton: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Your line is open.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning guys. Tom, is there any of your top 10 markets other than maybe Houston where redevelopment isn't penciling today, where you are not able to get the returns that you would want in order to put capital to work.
Thomas Grimes: The redevelopment program is going strong Rob and it is generally not sort of a market by market decision. So it is has a bias there but in those assets are working every now and then, we will test a property to see if it works and then back off pretty quickly but there are no ongoing redevelopment jobs that we have backed off on or cancelling and on the tests that we do, we are generally seeing the same go forward rate as we had in the past. That is a place where new development does help us a little bit on assets that is 10 years old and they build right next to year, the latest and greatest and charge $500 bucks more, we can pop out the nice from micro counter tops and put in granite and charge 200 or something like that. It gives us an opportunity to grow that program.
Rob Stevenson: And then, Tom or Eric, I mean, when was the last time when you go back and look at the secondary markets actually outperformed your large markets for any length of period of time? I know it has gotten smaller as a percent, it gets you down to like 35% of NOI, now. But I'm just curious as you think about the portfolio going forward and sources of capital and things of that nature, whether or not that goes significantly lower because it seems like it's been a while since those markets have really outperformed?
Eric Bolton: You have to go back to really late 2008 throughout most 2009 time frame when we saw obviously a fairly deeper session taking place in the country. We saw the employment markets really take a beating and those kind of environments, recessionary environments, where job loss is really driving sort of the economic landscape, that tends to be where the secondary markets hold up a lot better and you can actually get to a point where the secondary markets are outperforming the large markets, both in terms of occupancy and in our ability to hold rents. So I think they are really more for that purpose for sort of severe economic or economic downturn conditions, I think that what you are going to see is as we have continue to cycle capital out of some of the older investments that we would had as you have pointed out, a lot given the sort of base rich notion of the company and where we sort of came from allow the over asset happen to be in some of the more tertiary market of the portfolio and that’s where we cycled out a lot of we have accident close to 20 property over the last several years, selling over 13000 apartments. I think as we go forward you will see us continue with the primary focus on cycling out of some of the older assets where the CapEx requirements are growing and the after CapEx is likely to show more moderation and that will continue to adds an example to seven properties that we have under contract right now. Three of them are [indiscernible] sale in North Carolina, one of them is in Greensborough, one of them is in Huntsville. I think that - but having said that you will see us continued to look at opportunities in places like Charleston, Kansas city, Fredericksburg, clearly other secondary markets but we think that newer assets where we think the return on capital will be better over the next several years versus what we are selling.
Rob Stevenson: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Tom Lesnick of Capital One.
Tom Lesnick: Hi, guys good morning, thanks for taking my question, I guess first, I was just curious, how is June across your markets? And I guess in that context, could you provide a little insight on what the quarter trends were like, were they consistent across all three months or was there some choppiness there?
Eric Bolton: Tom, they were really pretty consistent in terms of how rents went, blended rents went through, so June fits in line with what the quarterly average was and you know I guess there weren’t a lot of difference between May, June and July and what the second quarter was to answer you on market level.
Tom Lesnick: That's very helpful. And my second question, what's your view on the fragmentation opportunity today across apartments in the Southeast; I mean, I guess if you look where stock price is today and the current premium to NAV with that, what's your appetite for acquisitions and scale at this point?
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean we are very interested in pursuing opportunities, as I mentioned in my prepared comments our deal flow is running probably 30% higher than it was this time last year, we are pushing hard on underwriting and processing as much opportunity as we can. I think as always though our focus is centered on ability to make an investment and ultimately capture a NOI yield and cash flow growth rate out of that investment that is at or better than the long term average that we are goal, that we have for the company and so we are not one to be, I mean while we are certainly aware instances to the concept surrounding our focus on capturing our spread between our current cost to capital and current cap rates. You know our focus is just always instead centered on capital allocation model, with priority on capturing NOI yield that meets or exceeds long term earnings growth profile we have for the company and ability ultimately to achieve higher return on capital long haul that is better than what we think our investors are expecting.
Tom Lesnick: All right, thanks guys appreciate it.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Tom.
Operator: Our next question is from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird.
Drew Babin: Good morning guys.
Eric Bolton: Good morning Drew.
Drew Babin: In the first quarter, it looks like you had about a 40 basis point lift in your same-property revenue growth from fees, but wasn't accounted for by rent growth and occupancy growth. There seemed to be some contribution there that seemed to be absent in the second quarter and I was just wondering whether that was sort of a deceleration off of more rapid fee growth in past years or whether there's anything deliberate going on at the property level, maybe being a little less aggressive with these?
Eric Bolton: I’ll give you some color and then Tom can jump in it. If you think about the first quarter Tom, we had a little bit remaining year over year occupancy lift in the first quarter and as you build occupancy fees come with that and so that happen I think in the third quarter, fourth quarter and the first quarter to a smaller extend but that very fact is part of the big discussion earlier that has given a confidence we can pay back the last year. We think these going forward going to grow in good normalized growth. We are having just very high, very good growth last year related to growing occupancy in the final vestiges of Colonial.
Thomas Grimes: I would say the other thing that has been a headwind on fees is barely and frankly and that positive is it with turned down consistently we are getting less and less in the way of termination and spread fees which worked for us but those are material feels and then secondly in the first quarter we had a sort of lights out delinquency bad debt month, we are still very, very good where we are but not quite as good.
Drew Babin: Okay that all make sense. And then one other question on some of the markets you mentioned throughout the Southeast, both large markets and secondary markets seems like demand growth is continuing to track very well, based on your comments? But it looks like just on a pure rent growth basis, there was a little bit of deceleration in few of the markets, we just wondering kind of is that supply issue primarily, not direct but indirect, you know is that something potentially could burn off of the coming quarters, what is behind that?
Eric Bolton: Of course, this is going to depend on the market we are talking about and so forth but broadly I would tell you that wherever we see any sort of if you will deceleration quarter over quarter basis in a given market more often than not it is a function of supply issue in a particular sub market affecting given property or something to that degree. I mean fundamentally the demand dynamics, job growth, population trends, all the other sort of factors that drive renters and leasing prospects to our properties all those fundamentals continue to show evidence of sustained strength and consistent with what we have been seeing for some time and where there is moderation if you will is going to be pockets of supply here and there.
Drew Babin: Okay, thank you, that’s helpful, great quarter.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Drew.
Operator: Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Tayo Okusanya: Good morning everyone. So, just a quick question around supply, I know we've all kind of harped on is it seems like you guys are acknowledging that some of your markets are seeing increased supply and that it's manageable, but are there any markets where you start to worry that supply starts to overwhelm the system, and then you suddenly lose pricing power similar to what we're kind of seeing in New York and San Francisco?
Eric Bolton: I would tell you that I mean obviously we worry about hold of comp but two things that I would tell you is that obviously a lot of the supply that we are seeing in some of our markets it is tending to me more concentrated in some of the more urban core centric areas which happens to be where we don’t have a lot of exposure and so we don’t see anything suggesting that anything different is likely to ply out in the near term, so we continue to feel okay about that. We have been saying that supply had picked up over the last couple of years, so I mean we are not, it is not like it is a new thing. I mean it is just happens to be in areas that we don’t have a lot of concentration. But I would tell you if you are trying to get at what it is going to change the chemistry, what is going to change the leasing dynamic in a material way and put us into a scenario where we are having same kind of pressures that some of these portfolios in San Francisco and New York are having. From my perspective the only thing that really materially weakens the chemistry for us is that we see a material weakening on the demand side of the equation. We see some sort of economic recession take place in a material way that causes job loss to come back into the equation and jobs to really start to pull back and in absence some sort of major disruption on the demand side of the equation right now it is hard to see anything it is going to cause material disruption in the positive leasing chemistry that continues to allow us to deliver we think pretty above long term performance. It is moderated from what it was a couple of years ago as a consequence really, a little supply but honestly just tougher comps and that’s where the pressure has been but the strong trends per say are going to continue from what we see today.
Tayo Okusanya: That's helpful and then I'll just - again thanks for some of the comments on the back half of the year and what it could look like. Apart from some of the revenue pressures that you discussed, anything on the operating expense side that results in a weaker same-store NOI growth in the back half of 2016 versus the back half of 2015?
Albert Campbell: I think Tayo as we talk about a little bit in the call, very expense control, just as Tom said one of the hallmarks and we are very proud to continue that and across the lines as personnel, marketing for sure, very much under control. The one exception is real state tax as we talked about, we did get majority about valuations come out in the second quarter which is typical. In the beginning of year you sort of guessing on that just based on trends and so came out a little higher than we thought particularly in Texas as valuation in Dallas and Houston didn’t soften like we had thought hope did it would any. So I think that’s where the only pressure expenses is, we raised our guidance a percent at the midpoint on real estate tax guidance. Now we think it will grow about that 6.5%. That’s you know thorough to be operating expenses but even with that we reduce, we were able to reduce midpoint of our expenses for the year by about 25 basis points. So some revolve that is, now we expect to be well under control.
Tayo Okusanya: Got it, okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.
Wes Golladay: Good morning guys. Great quarter, looking at the demand side, job growth in US has tapered off a bit. Have you changed your outlook on demand for your portfolio?
Eric Bolton: Yeah, Wes at this point we have - I mean we will be taking a hard look at expectation for 17 as we work towards developing initial guidance and so forth on that. But as we see here today you know we haven’t seen any evidence that weakness in employment trends are going to create any issues for us of course the other thing that’s a strong under pinning to the demand component of our business is just all the sort of psychology surrounding home ownership versus rending their homes and all the demographic factors that are continued to work in our favor and so those powerful forces are there and they are going to continue from many thing that we see would allow us powerful forces to really be unleashed of courses, is a good job employment scenario where people can get the job. From what we see, employment trends tend to generally some of the particularly larger markets across the South East tend to be at the high end relative to what we see elsewhere across the country and that’s largely frankly why we tend to focus, as much as we do on that region.
Wes Golladay: Okay and have you seen any, I guess, secular trends where big corporations are now moving into your markets, I think Dallas and Fort Worth have been a big beneficiary of that over the last few years, but I guess throughout your portfolio, are more companies getting ready to move to your cities and do you have any - I guess, next year that would be noticeable?
Eric Bolton: The South East continues to be a place lending significant manufacturing jobs, Volkswagen expanding and BMW expanding, probably largest Auto plant in North America outside of Greenville, and Tristan [ph] which already has Boeing rocking all along has picked up Volvo as well, General Dynamics expanding. So we are seeing those things happen as well as with Panama Canal opening up, our port locations have opportunity goes well. So those are continuing.
Thomas Grimes: And the markets as you mean, Atlantic continues to be a very strong magnet for corporate relocation just great quality life airport capability there and so and so. I mean Dallas, Fort Worth, Atlanta, I think Charlotte and Orlando, we are seeing really good things in terms of job grow and corporations moving operations to Orlando as well.
Wes Golladay: Okay thanks for all the color.
Operator: We’ll move next to Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Rich Anderson: I sort of keep it going but I'm just trying to think of the land gained projection. How much of that is completed and are there any kind of gains or actually should I say land proceeds, are there any more gains expected for the third or fourth quarter?
Eric Bolton: Nothing significant Rich, I will tell that is us continuing to move through, almost two small talk about now because of the income statement want to walk that through for you. So three parcels of land from the Colonial Merger, the remaining joint venture we had very small and the gains are small. It is all about half a million dollars on the income statement. So we have another few parcels of land we make sale of the course of the year and really the point there is, we value those well, we are getting gains on that sale, we don’t think it will be significant but we are glad to turn that with more productive capital in our properties and have a slight gain over the back half of the year.
Rich Anderson: Would you be able to tell us what NAREIT FFO would be from a guidance perspective relative to your 5.85% on a core basis?
Eric Bolton: I think it would probably and will have that right from Rich, I mean you have to get that with your offline but that certainly would be a little bit I am not sure that is higher, how many cents? $0.6 per share higher, that is not precision right now.
Albert Campbell: Around $6 FFO for the year Rich, given
Rich Anderson: $6 right. That said could you have a big debt mark to market that would be in the near eight number.
Albert Campbell: Correct, so from 585, excuse me.
Rich Anderson: Okay great, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Conor Wagner of Green Street.
Conor Wagner: Good Morning.
Eric Bolton: Good morning Conor.
Conor Wagner: On the redevelopment program, can you tell us how the units you did in 2014 are doing relative to their comps?
Eric Bolton: Our units done in 2014 relative to their comps.
Conor Wagner: Yes, you mentioned you get like 10% rent bump on the ones you are doing today. I was just wondering how durable that is, now that we're two years out from some of those redevelopments or the ones that you did in 2015?
Thomas Grimes: What happens there is that, you don’t have comps anymore if that make any sense because on something that all the unit has, it don’t have a comp to compare to because we redeveloped the whole property.
Eric Bolton: Tom is referring to comps meaning you know non-renovated units at the community. You are referring to the comps as what is happening in the market. And we would have to, we can get offline and figure out a way to pull that for you Conor but basically what we basically we do is, we do renovate, we go into our system and we make sure that the system knows that unit has had a capital infusion and therefore when we look at market rate trends over the next seven eight years, we take our comparison for our unit and that premium markup has to be there on a continuous basis for five or seven years or in other word, whatever premium we got to market when we initially did the deal, we track it to make sure that premium stays in place over the life of the investment that we make and there is, we have classification on buy unit where we can charge premiums for use, we can charge premiums for this upgrade, we can charge premiums for whatever, we got a lot of different premium levers and when we throw those levers they stay there and that becomes the benchmark that compares against the market.
Conor Wagner: So then, I guess you could say, if you track those units from 2014 you're obviously still able to get that premium?
Thomas Grimes: Yes.
Eric Bolton: Yes.
Conor Wagner: And then for your redevelopment plan, do you plan on doing a similar number of units in the 2017?
Thomas Grimes: What happens there is that, you don’t have comps anymore if that make any sense because on something that all the unit has, it don’t have a comp to compare to because we redeveloped the whole property.
Eric Bolton: I would think we would be in that ballpark, I mean hadn’t penciled it just yet, the pipeline continues. It can, and we feel good about the opportunity to do at least that.
Conor Wagner: And that's typically going to be about a $5 million boost to NOI in a given year, so that like 1% boost to NOI growth?
Eric Bolton: I think it is closer to 40 perhaps.
Conor Wagner: I guess, all right maybe from the rolling of the previous year, right. With the stuff that you're doing -
Eric Bolton: Double off, that would be correct.
Conor Wagner: You do it on a continual basis. And then last question just on renewals, where are you sending them out for August and September?
Eric Bolton: We are going out at 6.5% to 7%
Conor Wagner: 6.5% to 7%, great. Thank you very much guys.
Eric Bolton: Okay thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Buck Horne of Raymond James.
Buck Horne: Hey there, good morning guys. Appreciate the time. I was just browsing some of these stats that just hit the tape [ph] from the Census Bureau talking about a million new households are being formed all of them renters in the last quarter, at least on a year-over-year basis, and looks like the homeownership rate just hit the lowest level since 1965. I guess my question is are you guys surprised at this point in the cycle that move-outs to homeownership are not going up at this point, where the mortgage rates are at and what's happening out there? I guess is there any signs in your incoming tenants whether it's average FICO or rent to income or some other metrics that - something is changed in the demographics or changed in the propensity to rent or preventing people from buying?
Eric Bolton: No, I mean Buck the rents to income ratio of our folks is about 17% and 18%. Their credit scores are very strong. Either folks that could go by house tomorrow are choosing not to and really nothing in our sort of what we are seeing in demographics that makes us think that I mean 74% single right now, or predominantly female there, they just doesn’t seem to be a lot of demand for owning your home out of our residents at this point.
Thomas Grimes: Buck, I mean you research this very well and you know lot about this but these trends but I just think it gets back to just the whole psychology that late 20 early 30 year old today is just different than it was years ago and I think that as you know whether they are getting married later in life or starting family later in life, just life conditions are different today than they were years ago and as a consequence to that, they are just more in kind want to rent their housing as supposed to making the obligations surrounding buying a home and it is hard for me to see how that is going to materially change. I think, people are more motivated to make a decision to buy versus a rent for life style reasons and attractive financing and low interest rate notwithstanding I don’t think it is going to compel people to abandon a lifestyle choice just because it gets little bit more affordable.
Buck Horne: I appreciate those comments. And just going back to the acquisition opportunities, have you seen or detected any changes to cap rate expectations in the market, just given maybe the surge of activity that you're seeing in the pipeline? What are cap rates for well-located property in your markets, roughly?
Eric Bolton: We are still seeing very low five, high for cap rates pretty routinely. We haven’t seen any evidence as to suggest the cap rates have materially changed. We are just seeing more opportunity and of course where we focus on some of these leased up opportunities as you know those are situations that are little bit more difficult to finance and only the strongest buyers can take on some of the initial dilution associated with acquiring a non-stabilized asset and our ability to execute on all cash basis from an acquisition perspective really gets us to a lot of opportunity versus a lot of the other constant that we run into our competitors that we into. So we haven’t seen any evidence to suggest the cap rates have changed in anyway. We are just seeing more opportunity and working that angle to our benefit.
Buck Horne: I appreciate it very much, thanks gentleman.
Thomas Grimes: Thank you, Buck.
Operator: And we’ll take question from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill: Good morning, thank you guys. First question just on Houston, interested in your perspective on where you think you are in the pricing cycle there, does it feel on the ground as though prices have stabilized or do you feel like there's more pressure ahead?
Eric Bolton: We are continuing to have pressure on new lease prices, so I think that’s going we are not quite bottom on there, renewals were still getting positive at 3, 3.5. So I think we have got little more tough slotting in Houston and I mean we are so - of course Houston is a very, very big market and it is going to vary a lot of sub market and some of our suburban locations are going to hold up better than some of those stuff around the gallery and well inside the loop and so it is going to vary a little bit. But I think Houston has got another three or four quarters to go before I mean, good news is supply has really stopped, debt stopped and I think you just got to work through the absorption over the next three or four quarters and I think Houston becomes more of a recovery story, perhaps in late 17 certainly by the time it get to 2018.
Dennis McGill: And then separately, a couple questions on turnover. When you look at your turnover today, I think in the past, there were times where it was in the low 60% range. Do you feel like normalized turnover is somewhere in that range or is it different today based the shift in the portfolio versus let's say 10 years ago?
Thomas Grimes: Yeah, I don’t think we will get back to those really hard turn over numbers, shift in the portfolio as well as shift in consumer habits around.
Eric Bolton: I think as Tom said there is two factors, as we have sold of some of the older properties that we had over the last several years, a lot of those properties where in some of these smaller more tertiary market and some of those properties tend to be dominated by more of a military profile where you tend to have a higher turnover rate associated with the activity at the property and I think that is a little bit apply in our portfolio coupled with the other point Tom mentioned which is just renter psychology is so much different and average length of stay in our portfolio is longer than it has ever been and our average rent is higher than it has been and I just think that you know the odds of getting back to 64% - 65% turnover, we just don’t see anything that is likely to get us in that direction.
Dennis McGill: So, if you thought about and appreciate that you probably are not going to get back to 64% or 65%. If hypothetically renter choices change and let's say it trends back to 60% over a couple of year period, what would that do to operating margin if you isolated that instance and let's say pricing power remains relatively similar 3% to 4% type range, if that happened over a couple of year period?
Eric Bolton: Every 1% change it is about a penny for share so it is not quite a significant as you think but it is the best impact you could think about.
Dennis McGill: Okay perfect, thanks guys.
Eric Bolton: Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
Eric Bolton: All right we appreciate for joining us this morning and follow up with us if you have any other questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, this does conclude today’s MAA Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines. And everyone have a great day.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-05-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating in the MAA First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Lindy. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, Senior VP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call, will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. When we reach the question-and-answer portion of the call, I would ask for everyone to please limit their questions to no more than two in order to give everyone ample opportunity to participate. Should you have additional questions, please re-renter the queue or you are certainly welcome to follow-up with us after we conclude the call. Thank you. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim. As detailed in our earnings release, MAA started 2016 with solid first quarter operating results that were ahead of expectations. Average daily physical occupancy at 96.2% and effective rent growth at 4.5% drove same-store revenues higher than forecasted. We expect the solid momentum in leasing across our portfolio to continue over the balance of the year. As Tom will outline in his comments, in the first quarter, our properties continue to post low resident turnover, strong occupancy, and captured solid pricing performance. Importantly, we enter the busy summer leasing season with the portfolio well-positioned to take advantage of the favorable leasing conditions. Given the strong start to the year, we have raised the midpoint of our earnings guidance for core FFO for the full-year to $5.81 per share. Investor interest in apartment real estate remains high across our markets and we continue to find the acquisition environment challenging with pricing reflecting strong demand from private and institutional buyers. Cap rates continue to hold up, despite a higher volume of new supply coming into the market. Our deal flow and transaction pipeline is more robust than we’ve seen over the last of couple of years and we’re certainly underwriting a higher volume of opportunity. We continue to believe that as we work later into the cycle, we will find more opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria. Until then, we plan to remain disciplined and deploy capital only when we are comfortable with the value proposition and earnings accretion to be captured. As Al will recap, our balance sheet is in a very strong position and we continue to build capacity for future growth. As noted in our earnings release, Moody’s recently moved MAA’s current Baa2 rating to a positive outlook. We believe our established record of producing steady value growth and strong operating performance coupled with credit and coverage metrics that are stronger than any point in our company history has MAA well-positioned to continue to build our long-term competitive advantages across our footprint. After several years of strong operating performance, questions surrounding the sustainability of the current leasing environment is certainly a hot topic. Based on what we are experiencing across our portfolio, which is diversified across urban, inner loop, suburban and satellite city submarket locations in both large and secondary markets, demand does not appear to be weakening and all indications are that we will continue to capture good leasing velocity over the next few quarters. Conversations with a number of developers suggest that construction financing is becoming increasingly harder to secure and those pressures coupled with higher land and construction costs are raising the bar to justify new starts. It’s worth noting that new construction permitting across our markets is down so far this year compared to the trends we’ve seen over the last two years. We continue to believe that new supply trends are unlikely to materially disrupt the positive momentum for apartment leasing within our submarkets. Across our portfolio, the outlook for the ratio of new job growth to new apartment deliveries actually improves in 2017 as compared to this year. And while our crystal ball is certainly no better than anyone else’s, I do still believe our business retains cyclical patterns, it’s difficult to see any sort of near-term significant deterioration of leasing fundamentals. While our occupancy comparisons get tougher in the back-half of the year, given the essentially full occupancy status of the portfolio last year, the rent trends remained encouraging. So overall, our focus for the balance of the year remains centered on taking full advantage of the great operating fundamentals to drive earnings and build platform strength and capacity, while remaining very active in the transaction market and disciplined in our assessment of new growth opportunities. Before turning the call over to Tom, I do want to thank our MAA associates for their focus and efforts in preparing for the upcoming busy summer leasing season. You have the portfolio well-positioned and I very much appreciate all of your hard work and great results. Tom?
Thomas Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter NOI performance of 7.1% was driven by revenue growth of 5.5% over the prior year and 1.1% sequentially. We have good momentum in rents and saw effective rents increase 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average physical occupancy contributed 60 basis of revenue growth over the prior year. Overall, expenses remain in line, up just 2.9%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry leading initiatives, such as our vendor owned inventory shops stocking program, which will be completed this year have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check. April demand trends continue the positive momentum. Average physical occupancy of 96.2%, ran 40 basis points ahead of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period is just 8.2%, in line with the same time last year. April blended rents on a lease-over-lease basis are up 4.8%. Occupancy exposure and pricing are all in good shape, as we head into our summer leasing season. On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results of 5.9%. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Atlanta and Charlotte. The secondary markets achieved 4.6% revenue growth. In these markets, we are benefiting from improved job growth, as well as a sophisticated operating platform that has competitive advantages across our footprint in markets. Revenue growth in Charleston, Greenville, Savannah and Jacksonville stood out. As mentioned above, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy, rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry bead is Houston, which represents just 3.5% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. Move-outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 4.4% over the prior year and turnover remained low at 52.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Move-outs to home buying were down 4.6%. Move-outs to home rentals were also down 14% and represent less than 7% of our total move-outs. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupancy, again paid off, the decrease in average days vacant between occupants for the quarter helped drive the first quarter average physical occupancy to 96.2%. During the quarter, we completed over 1,400 interior unit upgrades. We expect the redevelopment – we expect to redevelop approximately 5,000 units this year. As a reminder on average, we spend about $4,500 per unit and receive an average rent increase of $95 over a comparable non-renovated unit. This generates a year one cash return of well over 20%. Our active lease-up communities are performing well. You will notice in the supplemental data that we completed the construction of Station Square at Cosner’s Corner II during the quarter. It’s currently 94.2% occupied and due to the stronger than expected lease-up, we’ve moved the stabilization date forward one quarter to the third quarter of 2016. Cityscape at Market Center II is leasing well. They are 84% leased and expected to stabilize on schedule in the third quarter of this year. We are off to a solid start and are well-positioned, as we head into the summer leasing season. Al?
Albert Campbell: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I’ll provide some additional commentary on company’s first quarter earnings performance, balance sheet position, and then finally on revised earnings guidance for 2016. Core FFO, which excludes certain non-cash and non-routine items was $1.44 per share for the quarter, which represents a 9% increase over the prior year. And this performance was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. The strong performance for the quarter was primarily produced by favorable property revenues, which was broad based, average occupancy, average effective rents, fees and collections were all slightly better than expectations for the quarter producing about two-thirds of the favorability. Operating expenses, interest and G&A expenses combined to produce the remainder of the favorability. During the first quarter, we acquired one new community located in Fredericksburg, Virginia for a total investment of $61 million, which was stabilized on acquisition. We also sold one commercial property during the first quarter, Colonial Promenade Nord du Lac located in Covington, Louisiana, which included both operating retail and land parcels. Total proceeds for this disposition were $33.2 million and we recorded a total gain on sale of $2.4 million related to the transaction. Also, this property represented the final wholly owned operating commercial assets acquired from Colonial. During the quarter, we completed the construction of one new community Station Square at Cosner’s Corner Phase II, located in Fredericksburg, which remains in lease-up and was 78% occupied at quarter end. We have four communities, all Phase II expansions remaining under development at the end of the quarter. We funded an additional $13 million of construction costs during the quarter and expect to fund about $63 million to complete the current development communities over the next year or so. We continue to expect NOI yields in a 7% to 7.5% range for these communities, once completed and stabilized. We also invested $6.2 million in our interior redevelopment program during the first quarter, capturing rent increases of 9% above non-renovated units. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. As Eric mentioned during the quarter, Moody’s affirmed MAA’s unsecured debt rating of Baa2 and revised the outlook on the company to positive from stable. Now two of the three primary rating agencies have a positive outlook on MAA, which further exhibits the strength of our balance sheet. At quarter end, our leverage defined as net debt to gross assets was 40.7%, and defined as total debt to market cap was 29.7%. Our recurring EBITDA covered our fixed charges of 4.2 times. At quarter end, 93% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates, at an average effective rate of just 3.7%, with well laddered maturities averaging 4.6 years. We also had over $645 million of total cash and credit available at quarter end, providing flexibility. And finally, as Erik mentioned, we are revising our earnings guidance for 2016 with this release. We are increasing our core FFO projection by $0.03 per share at the midpoint to reflect both the strength of the first quarter results and also the offsetting impact of revised transaction volume and timing. Core FFO is now projected to be $5.71 to $5.91 per share, or $5.81 at the midpoint, based on average shares and units outstanding of about 79.6 million. Core AFFO is projected to be $5.01 to $5.21 per share, or $5.11 per share at the midpoint. You may notice in our release, that we introduced one additional metric this quarter, Funds Available for Distribution or FAD, which represents core FFO less all capital spending, including discretionary items such as redevelopment and revenue enhancing capital, as well as corporate and casualty loss expenditures. The intention is to show the overall strength of our earnings and cash flow. For the full-year, we expect our FAD or FFO less all internal CapEx to be sufficient to cover our total annual dividend with $90 million to $95 million remaining for investment or to build capacity for future growth. We are maintaining our guidance range for same-store NOI for the full-year, along with the other components of previous guidance with the one exception, our projected acquisition volume, which we now expect to be between $250 million and $350 million for the year. Our current plans do not includes any need for new equity during 2016 and we now expect to end the year with our leverage about 130 basis points below the 2015 year end levels. So that’s all we have in the way for prepared comments. So Lindy, we’ll now turn the call over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hi, good morning. It’s Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just on the investment side, at the beginning of the year you talked about match funding acquisitions with dispositions and cash flow. Given that you’ve dialed back the acquisition assumption here a bit, what are plans with the excess proceeds now?
Eric Bolton: Well, at this point, we continue to believe that we will be able to put some money to work later this year. We do have a group of properties teed up for disposition that we will look at later this year for possible sale. But it really comes down to finding an attractive use of capital right now, which is, as I alluded to is tough. But I can tell you, we closed the one deal earlier this year, we’ve got a couple of other properties that are currently under contract going through due diligence. So we continue to believe that as we get later in the year, that we may find more opportunities. But we just felt like, given where we were with the transaction volume so far this year that – and based on our earlier assumptions that pulled back just a tad from what we initially had thought was the right thing to do. But we’ll see how the year plays out.
Austin Wurschmidt: Are you still assuming a ratable sort of acquisition activity through the year, or do you expect it to be front or back-end loaded?
Thomas Grimes: We have been expecting really more toward the back-half of the year starting in July through the rest of the year. Usually, as Eric mentioned, the activity picks up, as people are playing for their portfolios for the year. So we have sort of evenly July through the rest of the year a deal a month for six months. I mean, there is no magic to that, that’s just what we’ve assumed and we believe that’s the right thing to do right now.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks for the detail. And then just last one from me, just based on the heavy lifting you’ve done on the sell side, I mean, would you say you are more biased on the sell, or to sell additional assets or pull back, given how strong the transaction market is? And would you consider selling more, I guess, to reduce leverage?
Eric Bolton: No, at this point, we’ve really accomplished a lot of the repositioning we were after with the portfolio. And so we don’t have any sort of strategic agenda surrounding repositioning the portfolio at this point, other than a plan to just every year look at opportunity to pull capital out of to say 10 or 15 assets where we feel like the future growth prospects are not as robust as we could perhaps achieve with another alternative investment. And so it’s really now at a point where we’re just looking for a steady recycling program and really more focused on match funding that process, and looking to keep the balance sheet strong, the coverage metric strong as we continue to just build portfolio strength through this sort of steady recycling effort going forward.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks for taking my questions.
Eric Bolton: Yes.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I’m wondering if you can talk about, where same-store is trending relative to initial guidance, recognizing you didn’t change it, but 1Q results were ahead of expectations, you now have April as well and some clarity in two renewals at least for May and June?
Albert Campbell: Let me give you a little color on that, Nick. That’s a great question on our guidance change. So the summary of it is we’ve raised guidance FFO for the year $0.03 in total. That’s comprised of really two things. We did add $0.06 per share to our operating performance, that’s about same-store and non-same-store, which both are doing well. There’s some several lease-up committees in non-same-store. And so for that sort of it was in the first quarter and then so we haven’t increased that part of the year $0.02 and that’s really continued similar trends that we have, pricing of 4.5% continued very full occupancy of 96.2% on average, carrying through the year as we have projected on the fundamentals. But albeit at a little bit higher level, I mean occupancy level and the rent levels are coming off the Q1 performance was a little bit higher. That $0.06 has been offset by the change in volume and the timing of the transactions we talked about that that offsets that and takes $0.03 of that back for the year, that’s where the net $0.03 comes from. And so, we’ve maintained our same-store guidance range for the year, but obviously doing the math on that. We’re not at the midpoint. We’re moving toward the top part of that range now.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Sorry, go ahead.
Albert Campbell: I was just going to say, well obviously as we get more activity in leasing and real estate taxes and of some of the big arms, we’ll take a look at that in the second quarter.
Nick Joseph: Right, and then in terms of the occupancy comment, you said basically flat at 96.2%. Do you expect any variance between the quarters or should we expect pretty flat occupancy quarter-to-quarter?
Albert Campbell: We’re assuming it’s pretty to hold, I mean it’s full at 96.2% right now and we expect to hold that through the year now. And the comps for prior year as we talked about, they’ll get a little more challenging in the remaining three quarters of the year. I think last year Q2 was around 96.1%, Q3 was higher 96.5%, 96.6% maybe and the last quarter was 96.1% or 96.2%. So what we would expect is to hold 96.2% through the year and drop the pricing to 4% to 4.5% as we talked about and that will come fall to the bottom line of NOI.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And just the last question, the spread between the large and the secondary markets narrowed in the first quarter from what we saw in 2015. Do you expect that to continue to narrow?
Eric Bolton: Yes, I think at this point, we feel like it will tighten as things go by, but we wouldn’t expect secondary markets to start outperforming the large markets. Right now large, job growth is so good and the situation is stable, that we would expect those to continue to lead the way for us.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Robert Stevenson: Hi, good morning, guys. Given your commentary around acquisitions and given where you started delivering more in the development pipeline, what’s the sort of shadow pipeline that you have in terms of back half of 2016 starts or 2017 starts and how active are you out there looking for land or partners to do development projects with?
Eric Bolton: We’re pretty active talking to a lot of people. I will say this, I mean, our model and our strategy is not to bank land and so we’re not a true developer in the sense that we’re going to go out and look for land and go through zoning processes and go through the process that one typically has to go through from a full development perspective. Our model is really built around, looking for using the relationships that we’ve got to work with developers that perhaps have if you will, projects ready to go or looking to tie up an opportunity that we find particularly attractive and essentially go at it on a pre-purchase basis. We’re having a lot of those kind of conversations right now. Obviously at this point in the cycle, we’re being pretty careful with our underwriting and our assumptions. We’ve looked at a number of them since so far this year and frankly just couldn’t get comfortable pulling the trigger on a number of deals believing that the – what the developer was anticipating in terms of rent levels and rent growth, we couldn’t get comfortable with it. But yes, we’re looking a lot of things right now. We’ll see what the back half of the year holds.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then, I mean, given the commentary around acquisition is being difficult, et cetera, with this free cash flow, I mean is there the ability to pull forward some of your redevelopment opportunities and get to them faster than you otherwise would have with the additional capital allowing you to drive rental rate higher in the interim?
Thomas Grimes: Yes. I mean Rob there is always the opportunity to do more, but there is not an opportunity to do it better. We really want to be very disciplined in our approach of allocating capital in that area, and what we want -- this is an area where it’s very easy to look out with rose colored glasses and what we’re trying to do is turn a unit and redevelop it and make sure that a another unit is matched next to it. So that we know that the market is telling us that we’re getting that return that we’re telling you all that we have the return. So we’ll remain pretty methodical on that and we’re comfortable with our current pace and feel good about that.
Robert Stevenson: Okay and then Tom, realizing that it’s only 3.5% of your portfolio, can you sort of talk about what you’re seeing in Houston and is it certain submarkets there that are really getting hit hardest or is it just general malaise across the entire market?
Eric Bolton: No. I mean I will tell you. Houston during the quarter at 1.4% and we are a little more out of the inner loop if you will. I think the suburbs are holding up reasonably well. We have one community in the energy corridor and it’s a hair lower. But as a group we’re holding on to 96% occupancy. Turnover there is down 4.4%, delinquency trends are better and exposure is at 9%, which is little higher than the company average, but it’s hanging in there. Well, hanging in there is a wrong word, but it’s pretty consistent across the Board.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then Al, what was the cap rate on the acquisition in the first quarter?
Albert Campbell: It was about -- I’ll give you through the NOI yield was just over 6%, 6.1% and the cap rate, which is an economic was about 5.75%, 5.80%.
Robert Stevenson: All right, thanks guys.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.
John Kim: Thanks. In your large markets, the expense growth was actually higher sequentially than it was year-over-year, I imagine a lot of that was due to taxes. But did this come in ahead of your expectations and is there a concern that expense growth might come in at the high-end of your guidance range?
Albert Campbell: John, I’ll give you some of this, and Tom might have some on this as well. But no, I mean the tax – there tends to be a lot of volatility sequentially on expenses, particularly from Q4, Q1 and you put your finger on taxes, is a big issue. Lot of times you have favorable appeals or final results coming in at the end of the prior year. And then in the next year, you’re starting with taxes, which are a quarter of your operating expenses or more and you’re starting on a full run rate for the year. So that created a lot of volatility that is one significant point that that’s probably the trend across. Maybe, Tom you may add?
Thomas Grimes: No and also, I mean John, that’s the point. I think we’re quite confident in our ability to manage expenses and guidelines for the rest of the year on those items.
John Kim: Okay. And then, I think Tom you mentioned that move-outs were low this period. What do you attribute this to and is this sustainable?
Thomas Grimes: It is not just sustainable. It’s been going on for probably four straight years that we’ve seen declining turnover numbers. The driver again this year was the reduction in home buying, where folks continue to appreciate the flexibility of leasing a home, job transfer is the other reason for moving, and it stayed fairly steady. But it’s really home buying that’s pushing the change.
Eric Bolton: Typically John I’d tell you that, what I think probably causes turnover to materially start to move up, frankly, as we start to see the economy start to heat up. Because as Tom alluded to the two biggest factors that create turnover, are people leaving us to buy a house or they’re -- which is actually the number two reason. The number one reason, people leave us is because of a change in their employment and a job transfer and things of that nature. And what we typically see is, when the economy starts to really get even more robust, turnover can pick-up a little bit. But of course with that improving economic environment, it also continues to create more demand for our product. And so we tend to think that as we see maybe a little pressure on turnover expenses that we likely will capture it in more robust rent growth, if we do in fact see material pick-up and turnover begin to occur.
John Kim: So would you characterize the employment growth as moderate and not very strong right now in your market?
Eric Bolton: Yes, I would say it’s better than – a little better than moderate, but we’ve seen it stronger, that’s for sure. I think it’s in pretty good position right now and of course we’re seeing people stay in our apartments longer than they ever have and lease terms have lengthened out, a good bit. So we – it’s hard to see anything right now that’s going to materially change the turnover pattern absent a major change in sort of economic conditions.
John Kim: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Rich Anderson: Thanks. Good morning, great quarter. So even though you’re not saying it, anyone who is kind of listening to this call is probably expecting a same-store guidance increase next quarter, and I could appreciate you holding off and doing that this early in the year. But what would have – what would it take for you to have to reiterate your 4% or 5% same-store NOI growth? And I’ll just tell you, we put in 4% average same-store NOI growth for the remaining three quarters of the year to get you just below 5% for the full-year. You said you’re confidence – confident in expense control. So it’s hard to imagine it won’t go up, but I’m just curious what has to happen for it to stay the same?
Albert Campbell: Well, I think you put your finger on it Rich, and your math is, I would agree with that in terms of expectations for the remainder of the year. And I think what we’re betting on or expecting is to continue stay very cool in occupancy 96.2% through the year and then have pricing growth of 4% to 4.5% that would be little above the midpoint on that that continues to go out well. And if those things occur, I think we’re confident that that the math that you indicated and the position range is correct. So we would have -- it would have to be a fall off in occupancy and rents as we push through the year. Obviously expenses, it could be as well, but I think we’re more confident in the historical and current control events.
Eric Bolton: I think the two biggest line items are, the year-over-year change in occupancy and the year-over-year change in real estate taxes, and I think both of those line items get a lot more clarity over the next three months and I think that that’s really what it comes down to. The rent trends are there…
Albert Campbell: Yes.
Eric Bolton: And as long as we don’t see any volatility beyond what we anticipate in terms of performance on occupancy we’ll be good. And of course we don’t really get good clarity on real estate taxes until really late in summer.
Albert Campbell: Yes.
Rich Anderson: So you’re saying the occupancy and taxes become more – there is more clarity because they become more difficult comps?
Eric Bolton: No, just because we get more information. We have obviously more of our leases expiring in the busy summer months than we typically do in the winter months. And so reprising and releasing those units with that greater level of lease expiration activity, that’s a point of volatility, if you will. And then as I mentioned, we won’t see clarity on real estate taxes until late Q2 or early Q3.
Rich Anderson: Okay. And then can you comment on some of your Florida markets, in particular Orlando was really strong. And the reason why I’m asking about that specific market is, because others have been pointing to Florida as an area of strength, but I’m not so sure how long that will stay intact. And so I’m wondering if those are areas where you might consider pruning as long as it’s really hot and just a comment under long-term prognosis of your plan in Florida, in some of your key Florida markets?
Thomas Grimes: I will take the performance side of things. To us, Florida is moving along nicely and we expect that to continue. There is not a sign, early sign that a slowdown is coming in Orlando, Tampa or Jacksonville or South Florida for that matter. So we feel like those frankly were a little behind the Texas markets and Atlanta coming on board strongly. So we feel like they’ve got ways to run on that one.
Rich Anderson: Okay, great. Thank you.
Thomas Grimes: Thanks Rick.
Operator: And our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Drew Babin: Good morning.
Eric Bolton: Good morning Drew.
Drew Babin: A quick question on your ROI CapEx projects related to Colonial. Now that some of those properties are now in their second year post renovation, is there any clarity on what year two cash flow yields may look like on those properties? Is it likely to look a lot like year one or is there some kind of diminishing benefit to the renovations?
Albert Campbell: I’ll just give an overall stroke on that Drew and not on a property – project-by-project basis. But one thing you’ll notice in our guidance this year is that our cash flow growth is partly built on the fact that our recurring CapEx needs go down a little bit this year. And that’s planned and expected, and it’s a good part of our growth story. And so as we bought Colonial and we worked through some of those issues and had a little higher recurring CapEx for 2014, a little bit in 2015. And so 2016 is a better place to be to, kind of, touch on some of your comments, I don’t have a property by property or project by project, I think, we look at it as overall portfolio at this point. But it certainly reflects the points that you’re making.
Drew Babin: Okay, thank you. And then secondly on the Fredericksburg acquisition, I think you mentioned that it was $61 million. I mean, looking in supplemental to the year-to-date NOI of $300,000, I’m just curious, is there a renovation that was just completed? You said it was acquired and stabilized, so I’m just hoping to kind of square away where the cap rates come from?
Albert Campbell: That’s just one month, that thing was bought, but really had one month of operation, call it March. And so $300,000 really just represented that one month, Drew, so you wouldn’t read too much into that. That was really there to provide you the ability to pull that out for NAB building purposes, if you wanted to. And so, you can – you would have to get a full-year run rate that’s accurate, which we can provide for you offline, if we need to.
Drew Babin: Right, okay. I just thought that was a quarterly number which would…
Albert Campbell: Yes, you could take that really times 12 probably and get close.
Drew Babin: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ivy Zelman: Thanks for taking my question, guys, I appreciate it. If you are thinking about maybe the next few years and strategically some of the biggest opportunities that you are excited about and then maybe where you would be the most challenged and most concerned, I know you don’t have a crystal ball on the economy, but as you think about it just from a competitive perspective, or where you feel that there is the greatest challenges versus the greatest opportunity, just to see how you guys are thinking about? Thanks.
Eric Bolton: Well, Ivy, this is Eric. I would tell you that, I’m more excited about sort of the next four or five years and I can ever remember. We think we have the – both the platform and the balance sheet in such a strong position that as the opportunity unfolds over the next four or five years, I think that the opportunity for us to capture new growth – new value, if you will, is going to get better. I think that the thing that I think you have to think about is that, at some point over the next four or five years interest rates will probably start to move up a little bit. I think, we all hope, of course, the economy continues to move along, but it is cyclical. And while we’ve had some great performance dynamics over the last four or five years, it probably does moderate at some point over the next four or five years. And as a consequence of rising rates and as a consequence of perhaps reaching more normalized sort of trends from an operating perspective, I think our competitive advantages in the markets where we focus are capital growth. And I think our ability to create value versus what these markets are what – versus what people typically associate with these markets grows. And at the end of the day, what we are attempting to do is find a way to take shareholder capital and create a competitive advantage for, both in terms of how we are able to deploy capital and then how we are able to operate those investments once we make them. And I think both of those things get better for us over the next four or five years.
Ivy Zelman: That is extremely helpful. And I think the value add and what you are doing to drive the cash flow is very impressive. So congratulations, guys. Thank you.
Eric Bolton: Thank you.
Albert Campbell: Thanks, Ivy.
Operator: And our next question comes from Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Neil Malkin: Good morning, gentlemen. Nice quarter.
Eric Bolton: Hi, Neil.
Neil Malkin: First question, we’ve been hearing some rhetoric that now that the supply is probably peaking particularly in urban markets, now that comparatively land and pricing are more advantageous in the suburban areas. Are you seeing any early indications that supply maybe getting a little bit more elevated in some of your suburban markets that it performed well?
Eric Bolton: No, really not, Neil. I mean, I think that the pressures on construction costs, the pressures on land costs, those pressures continue to exist in the suburban locations as much as they do in the urban locations. And I would tell you, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, I mean, we see permitting next – so far this year is down significantly from what it’s been for the last two years, 40% to 50% down. And so – and when you look at sort of the expectation of deliveries and contrast that against expected job growth, next year looks stronger than this year. So, we haven’t seen any evidence suggesting that supply issues that have – the supply that has been creating more issues in some of these more core markets in urban – heavy urban oriented locations is now going to migrate to the suburbs, we certainly see no evidence of that at this point.
Neil Malkin: Okay. Great, thanks. And then, on the – just considering supply is elevated, are you seeing more opportunities to acquire developments that are at the end of completion, or in lease-up currently, or is pricing just a little bit too aggressive for you?
Eric Bolton: Well, that’s – I mean, that’s – I do think that that’s where the biggest window of opportunity will continue to grow is those projects – new projects that are in the midst of lease-up. That is the point of sort of maximum pressure from a development perspective is, when you get to that point where most of all the units have been delivered, you are no longer in a position to be capitalizing a lot of the cost, you’re still in the lease-up mode, but yet you haven’t reached stabilization or break-even, if you will. Usually you are late in the term of the construction financing. And if you are not getting the rents and/or so lease-up is not growing as fast as you thought it would, that’s where the most pressure is created. And frankly, that’s where we think the better buying opportunities will continue to emerge. Now, we’ve seen some of those, but we’ve also seen some very aggressive investors willing to come in and make some what we feel to be some very, very aggressive assumptions and buy on that basis, which we are not going to do. But I do think that as we get later in the cycle and later this year into next year and a lot of the supply continues to come online, I think, there could be some better buying opportunities.
Neil Malkin: Okay, great. And then last for me, can you talk about what new leasing renewal rates came in the first quarter and then how you are kind of seeing them trend into second quarter?
Albert Campbell: Yes, sure. On a lease-over-lease basis, blended was 3.8% [ph] for the first quarter and April, it pulled up to 4.8%.
Neil Malkin: And that’s blended in April?
Albert Campbell: Yes, that’s blended.
Neil Malkin: All right. Thank you, guys. Nice quarter again.
Eric Bolton: Yes.
Albert Campbell: You’re welcome.
Operator: And our next question comes from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Conor Wagner: Good morning.
Eric Bolton: Good morning, Conor.
Conor Wagner: In the acquisition market, are you seeing aggressive bidding across quality type and across markets? Are there any either quality types, or markets that are lagging behind?
Eric Bolton: To be honest with you, I mean, we are not looking at what I would consider to be a lot of B assets or even lower C assets, so I can’t really opine on that. But from a – we continue to see the higher quality assets’ pricing being pretty aggressive. And that’s the same, whether it is a large market or whether it’s more a secondary market, we’ve seen some very aggressive pricing in places like Charleston, Greenville even Kansas City, we’ve seen comparable in many cases to what we see take place in a Dallas or Atlanta, even still Houston. I mean, we’ve seen some assets based on our underwriting trade at sub 5 cap rates in Houston. So I think it’s again for the higher quality assets, which is what we tend to focus on from an acquisitions perspective.
Conor Wagner: But then on the disposition market, are you seeing the aggressive bid for their lower quality assets that you are looking to sell?
Eric Bolton: Well, we are about to get into the market on that front. But I mean all the indications are that we will see pretty good pricing relative to – similar to what we got last year would be our expectation, as we start to look at that side.
Conor Wagner: Thank you. And then on the redevelopment opportunities, are those focused in 2016 and any particular markets or is that spread evenly across the portfolio?
Thomas Grimes: No, it tends to focus and I’m going off the cuff here, but it is – it’s Charlotte, Raleigh, Charleston, Savannah, Orlando those are the drivers.
Conor Wagner: Great, thank you, very much.
Thomas Grimes: Opportunity, there is some level, pretty much across the portfolio.
Conor Wagner: Awesome, thank you.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Conor.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tom Lesnick, with Capital One. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Tom Lesnick: Great. Good morning, everyone. I guess first you guys have been increasing your asset allocation to Fredericksburg over the last several quarters. Obviously some of your peers have exposure to DC, but being that’s more in sell than Fredericksburg, what are you seeing in kind of the suburban Northern Virginia market, and what’s your outlook on that area for the next couple of years?
Thomas Grimes: It’s in full recovery mode, Tom. It is a kind of a pleasure to walk recently both the two assets that were developed and have the Phase II are right on 95% corridor, and doing quite well. The Cobblestone Square project is unique. It is literally built right in the – Fredericksburg, it’s one of those great satellite cities and its sort of core is historic district that’s very vibrant. We are right in the middle of that and very, very high demand from DC jobs. They’re walking distance to rail line and we’re seeing a positive rent growth, good occupancy, well exposure and demand on those three assets. So I feel good about the future of Fredericksburg.
Tom Lesnick: That’s very helpful. And then I guess, following-up on some comments earlier about the transaction market generally. As you guys just kind of seen a narrowing between large and secondary markets in terms of operating fundamentals, I know obviously some of your secondary markets don’t have as many trades, but across the entire spectrum, are you guys seeing a narrowing of cap rates between the large and secondary markets as well?
Eric Bolton: It’s been pretty consistent for the last year. So Tom, I would put the spread with the difference of roughly around 50 basis points and it’s been that way. I mean, if you go back a couple of years ago, it was probably closer to 75 basis points or maybe a little bit more than that, but what we saw over – starting a little over a year ago, was just as the cap rates and the opportunities in the larger markets became so expensive, we saw capital getting more aggressive in the secondary market. So that spread in today is 50 basis points or less and depending on the quality of the asset and the location, I mean they can be almost right on top of each other frankly in some of these secondary markets.
Tom Lesnick: Got it. Would you expect that spread to continue to narrow or kind of stay the same?
Eric Bolton: There is nothing that we’re seeing right now suggesting that it’s going to gap out and spread. I mean, we continue to see a lot of investor interest in both large and secondary markets. I think that, if you began to see a meaningful increase in interest rates, you could begin to see it spread a little bit, but the fundamentals being as strong as they are, investor interest in this space being as strong as it is, there’s certainly nothing to suggest near-term that we’re going to see any real change in cap rates from what we see.
Tom Lesnick: I appreciate it. Nice quarter guys.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Tom, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Buck Horne: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Most of my questions are answered, I just got one more. With the $90 million of kind of call it free cash flow, you guys are expecting to generate on annual basis. As you sit here today, could you rank for us – how you think about the options or how to use the incremental free cash flow you’re spinning off, I mean, whether that’s dividend increase or debt reduction or acquisition, how do you think about potential uses of that free cash?
Eric Bolton: Well, our most accretive use of capital right now is frankly our redevelopment program and we’re going to – as Tom alluded to earlier, we’re going to push that agenda as appropriately as we can. But if we push it too hard, we start to compromise the return. So – but absent that, I mean Buck I mean, frankly we’re comfortable with having the impact of the free cash flow for the moment at least showing up and just building balance sheet strength. And as Al alluded to, based on everything that we’ve got right now in our projections, we’ll see debt-to-gross assets decline another 150 basis points this year. That’s on top of comparable level of decline that we got last year. So I think this is a point where that discipline is important. And it always is important, but particularly right now. And if we wind up just not being able to put as much money out from an external growth perspective, and if you will, building capacity for the future opportunities I mean, that’s okay at some level. I mean, we’re at a point right now where – we feel like our sort of annual long-term earnings growth rate for the – from a cash flow perspective is approaching around 6% or so. We raised the dividend about 6% last quarter or last – for this year if you will and I’ve always believed that, you want to sort of get the platform into position where you can compound cash flow and compound dividend growth sort of a comparable rates. So for the moment, we’re just perfectly content to stay very active in the transaction market, stay disciplined and if the net result is, we’re just building balance sheet strength capacity for the future as a fall out or a residual result, that’s okay, we’re good with that.
Buck Horne: Okay, thanks, very helpful. And just back to the cap rate question, I think you spent some time talking about the spreads between large and secondary. But just can you quantify for us, just generally what absolute level you’re seeing in – for Class A assets in some of your markets?
Eric Bolton: Well, I can tell you in Class A assets in some of the larger markets are going to be 5%. We’ve seen some go well below 5%, 4.5%. I would tell you that in the secondary market, a high-quality assets going to probably be 5% to maybe 5.25%. But a lot of them I mean, we’re seeing a lot of stuff right around 5% in both large and secondary markets.
Buck Horne: Perfect, thanks very much.
Eric Bolton: You, bet. Thanks Buck.
Operator: We’ll go next to Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Drew Babin: Hi, just a very quick follow-up and somewhat following on Buck’s question. In an environment where there seems to be a bid for every type of asset, obviously property tax assessments have been catching up rapidly in CBD areas, do you see any risk of more kind of secondary markets, and maybe haven’t seen the assessment to creep up as much yet, maybe at least directionally catching up to some degree?
Thomas Grimes: Don’t really see any pressure of that right now Drew. As we talked about Florida, Texas and Florida, that they’re most aggressive, so no direct pressure on that. I mean other areas in our portfolio, pretty modest to normalized growth expectations. And obviously, we’ll get more information on that in the second quarter of this year.
Drew Babin: Okay, thank you.
Eric Bolton: Okay.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the program back to our speakers for closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: Thank you for joining us. And that’s all we have today and we will see everyone at NAREIT. Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude today’s program. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you and have a great day.

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-02-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating in the MAA Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin.
Timothy P. Argo: Thank you, Pricilla. Good morning, this is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. When we reach the question-and-answer portion of the call, I would ask everyone to please limit their questions to no more than two in order to give everyone ample opportunity to participate. Should you have additional questions, please re-renter the queue or you are certainly welcome to follow-up with us after we conclude the call. Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
H. Eric Bolton: Thanks Tim. MAA wrapped up calendar year 2015 with another quarter of strong performance. Importantly, we expect favorable leasing conditions across our region and the trend supporting record high occupancy and solid momentum in rent growth to continue in 2016. As outlined in our earnings release, our forecast for MAA for the coming year is defined by continued record occupancy results consistent with what was captured in 2015 and rent growth that is also consistent with the strong momentum from last year and that remained well above long-term averages. Operating expenses are expected to remain well in check with real estate taxes being the only item driving any pressure and reflecting the continued strong valuation in leasing fundamentals that are supporting the apartment market. During the fourth quarter, we captured positive pricing momentum across the portfolio on both the year-over-year and sequential quarterly basis. Tom will provide you with more details surrounding leasing conditions across our markets. But overall, we believe the supply and demand dynamics across our high growth Sunbelt region coupled with a portfolio that is uniquely diversified across both large and secondary markets and that offers a price point appealing to the largest segment of the rental market will drive solid results in 2016. As noted in yesterday's earnings release, we were successful in securing a couple of acquisitions in the fourth quarter, both of which have an efficient and accretive Phase II benefit to them, which enable the deals to work within our disciplined underwriting model. We expect the transaction market in 2016 will be similar to 2015 with robust transaction activity fueled by a high level of new development and lease up projects being brought to market with the continued high level of investor and buyer interest surrounding current valuations. We remain disciplined in our approach and have forecasted 2016 a comparable volume of acquisitions and new developments funding as compared to 2015 that we plan to match fund with the disposition activity and internally generated free cash flow. With the start of expansion and our newly acquired Denton property in Kansas City, we now have a $117 million of new development underway with each of the five projects representing highly accretive Phase II expansions of existing successful properties. During 2016, we also anticipate another active year of redevelopment through our very accretive kitchen and bathroom modeling program. Al will recap for you the changes in our balance sheet and transactions completed in fourth quarter, which further expands our growth capacity. As noted in our earnings release through a combination of the capital recycling completed last year and the free cash flow now being generated, the balance sheet was further deleveraged in 2015 with debt to market cap at 32.2% by year-end. We anticipate continued strengthening of the balance sheet in 2016. In summary, we believe MAA’s balance sheet is well positioned for future opportunities as they emerge. Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to say to all our MAA associates how much I appreciate all of your hard work and tremendous results in 2015. Thanks to your efforts. MAA produced top tier total investment returns for our shareholders in calendar year 2015 and we are well positioned to continue our legacy of outperformance over the full cycle as we head into 2016. And with that I'm going to hand it over to Tom. Tom.
Thomas L. Grimes: Thank you, Eric and good morning everyone. Our fourth quarter NOI performance is 7.3% was driven by revenue growth of 5.4% over the prior year. We have good momentum in rents and saw effective rents increase 4.4% on a year-over-year basis and 70 basis points sequentially strong average physical occupancy contributed 70 basis points over the prior year. Overall, expenses remain in line, up just 2.4%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry leading initiatives such as our vendor owned inventories shops stocking program, which will be completed this year have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check. January demand trends continue the positive momentum. Average physical occupancy of 96.1 ran 94 basis points ahead of last year. A 60-day exposure which is current vacancy plus all notices for 60-day period is just 7%. This is a 120 basis points stronger than the same time last year. January blended rents on a year-over-year basis were up 5%. Occupancy exposure at the critical beginning of the year are better than we have seen in recent years. On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results, they were led by our Orlando, Fort Worth, Atlanta and Phoenix. The secondary markets achieved 4.4% revenue growth. And these markets were benefiting from improved job growth as well as a sophisticated operating platform that has competitive advantages across our footprint in markets. Revenue growth in Charleston, Greenville, Savannah and Jacksonville all stood out. As mentioned above, our momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy, rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our market worry to-date is Houston which represents just 3.5% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor Houston closely and protect occupancy in this market. Turnover for the quarter was again down by 7.5%, and down 180 basis points on a rolling 12-month basis to 52.5%. Move outs to home buying was down a 100 basis points and remain below historic norms. Move outs to home rentals was down 6% and represents just 7% of our total move outs. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupancy again paid off. The improvements in average days vacant between occupancy for the quarter of 2.5 days helped drive down the fourth quarter average physical occupancy or drive the record average physical occupancy to 96.1%. During 2015, we've completed 5,781 interior unit upgrades, 3,200 of those were on legacy CLP communities. We expect to redevelop 5,000 units next year and expect the mix to continue to favor the legacy CLP portfolio. As a reminder, on average, we spent $4,500 per unit and receive $95 increase over our comparable non-renovated unit, generating a year one cash return of well over 20%. Our active lease-up communities are performing well, and we completed construction of 220 Riverside in Jacksonville in the fourth quarter. As you will notice in our release we moved the stabilization of this community up to Q1 of 2016 rather than Q2, because of better than planned lease-up supported by rents above pro forma. Colonial Grand at Bellevue II and Retreat at West Creek one both stabilized on schedule for the fourth quarter. Station Square at Cosner's Corner II and Cityscape at Market Center II are currently 67.5% and 82.1% at lease, and expected to stabilize in the fourth quarter and third quarters of this year respectively. We ended the 2015 in strong fashion and are well positioned for 2016. Al.
Albert M. Campbell: Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the Company's fourth quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally on initial guidance for 2016. The record occupancy levels, continued pricing momentum and solid expense control during the fourth quarter produced record levels of core FFO per share for both the quarter and the full-year 2015. Core FFO, which excludes certain non-cash and non-routine items was $1.45 per share representing a 10% increase over the prior year. Recurring capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.6 million or $0.11 per share, which produced Core AFFO of $1.34 per share providing strong coverage of our $0.82 per share quarterly dividend. Core FFO for the full-year was $5.51 per share also representing a 10% increase over the prior year. And our Core AFFO for the year was $4.80 per share representing a 12% increase over the prior year. The outperformance for the quarter was primarily produced by same-store NOI growth driven by continued record high average occupancy levels during the quarter 70 basis points above the prior year. And our operating expenses also remained well under control during the quarter increasing only 2.4% over the prior year with favorable real estate tax appeals riding some benefit in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, we acquired two new communities for a total investment of $79 million including the land [purchase] (Ph) of two Phase II expansions which were both started during the quarter. These purchases bring our full-year acquisition investment to $327 million for seven new communities containing 1,782 units. We also funded an additional $13.6 million of development costs for the five communities under construction during the quarter, all Phase II expansions leaving $74 million of the $117 million total projected cost to be funded as of year-end. We expect NOI yields in the 7% to 7.5% range for these communities once they are completed and stabilized. We also invested $8.3 million in our redevelopment program during the fourth quarter, bringing our full-year investment in the program about $31 million. We continue to capture rent increases of 10% above the non-renovated units from this program. During the fourth quarter, we completed several important financing goals for the year. We recast our unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing our borrowing capacity to $750 million from $500 million, extending the maturity to 4.5 years and improving the terms to reflect our stronger credit profile. We also refinanced $150 million term loan improving the rate about 25 basis points, extending the maturity and modifying the terms to be consistent with our new credit facility. Of course, we also executed a very successful bond issuance during the fourth quarter, issuing 400 million of 10 year notes at coupon rate of 4% priced at 98.99%, which complete our refinancing plans of 2015 debt maturity. We are very pleased with the investor support and execution of this issuance which we think and we believe provides further confirmation of this strength of our balance sheet. At year-end, our leverage defined as net debt to gross assets was 190 basis points below the prior year at 40.6%. Our current EBITDA continues to grow and reflect the quality of our earnings profile, covering our fixed charges about 4.5 times. At year-end 96% of debt was fixed or hedged against interest rates at an average effective rate of 3.8% with well out of maturities averaging five years and we also have over $700 million of total cash and credit available at year-end. Finally, we did provide and issue earning guidance for 2016 with the release. Core FFO is projected to be $5.68 to $5.88 per share or $5.78 at the mid-point based on average shares in units outstanding of about $79.6 million. Core AFFO is projected to $4.98 to $5.18 per share or $5.08 at the mid-point representing about a 6% growth of the prior year. The primary driver of 2016 performance is expected to be same-store NOI growth which is forecasted to be 4% to 5% base on a three and three quarters to four and a quarter percent growth in revenues. And two and three quarter to three and three quarter percent growth in operating expenses. Our revenue projection include expectations of continued record high occupancy levels averaging 96.1% through 2016 combined with continued rental pricing above long-term trends similar to 2015 levels ranging 4% to 4.5%. We expect operating expenses to remain well under control with real estate taxes continuing to present the [indiscernible] pressure as the strong operating performance pushes valuations higher. We expect acquisition volume to similar 2015 with $300 million to $400 million repurchases included in our projections; we also expect to fund an additional $50 million to $60 million of construction cost to the completion of the five communities under development. We plan to essentially match fund these investments with $200 million to $300 million of multifamily dispositions starting with $60 million of commercial assets in land dispositions and with $90 million to $95 million of internally generated free cash flow. And giving the timing required to recycle assets along with the initial loss of NOI deals, our forecast for the full-year includes $0.04 to $0.06 per share of dilution related to these 2016 dispositions points. Our current plans do not include the need for new equity during 2016 and we expect to end the year with our leverage at another slight year reduction from the prior year. That’s all that we have in the way of prepared comments, so Pricilla, we’ll now turn the call back over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator instruction] We will take our first question from David Toti with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open.
David Toti: Eric, quick question for you. Unlike many of you peers, the company appears to the projecting pretty decent acquisition volume in the year ahead. Can you give us a little more though as to where you see attractive opportunities in market? Is it because you are largely in markets with the recent competing, are you seeing yields become more attractive, what's the motivation for that picture volume?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, first of all, it's pretty consistent with what we did this year and we think the conditions in the market place in 2016 are going to be somewhat similar to what they were in 2015, if not more robust. As we get later in this cycle we just see more development projects in lease-up communities being brought to market. And our deal flow is running higher this time this year than it was at the same point last year. So we think the transaction market is going to be very active over the course of the year. And so we put a number out there $300 million to $400 million which is consistent with - we did a little over $300 million this year and we will see what happens. I’m optimistic that we will see something that become increasingly compelling and we may find some situations where we have these Phase II opportunities associated with them like we did in December. And I think that we will see how things play out over the course of the year. We have assumed in our guidance that we will do $200 million to $300 million of dispositions, we are going to wait on that. That will be more backend loaded over the course of year depending on what opportunities emerge on the acquisition front. So David it's not a specific detailed answer to you, but it's really more just to reflection of we think conditions are going to be consistent if not a little bit more robust from an activity perspective and that May yield some opportunities for us.
David Toti: Okay no that’s very helpful Eric, thank you. And my second question is just a quick one. I seem to recall the unit CapEx the money you are spending on sort of upgrading units to be producing yield that were around 12%, am I remembering wrong, it seem to be a little bit lower today.
Albert M. Campbell: I think what you probably return to is the internal rate of return data which is in the 11% to 12% range, but the rent growth compared to a non-renovate unit has consistently been 10% to 10.5% I think for a while. IR is higher than that.
David Toti: Okay, thanks for the detail today.
Operator: Thank you. And will move next to Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. I'm wondering if you could talk about how you build up the guidance. The stock has slowing off this morning and we saw a similar reaction last year at this time. The initial 2015 guidance - a sense than 2015 guidance clearly prove to be conservative and the stock has been a top performer. So do the guidance process this year change at all relative to how you said it in the past and how do you think about the opportunity and what you would need to see in order to exceed initial guidance similar to what you saw last year.
Albert M. Campbell: Thanks Nick. This is Al. I'll tell you a bit how it was prepared this year. No real changes there, I'll tell you, what we are expecting for 2016 first and foremost is not any deceleration in momentum in our business, and what we’re projecting is for occupancy level of 96.1% which is above the way record high for the company that we had in 2015 to carry through 2016. And I'm talking about average 365 days for the year which is pretty strong access full. And so on top of that I mean so you are flat with 2015 hold that level, on top of that we expect pricing levels to be consistent with 2015. Again, well above long-term averages and norms, we expect pricing to go up 4% to 4.5% and so that really is tradition that revenue growth and then we have the expense control we talked about the drop at the bottom line of NOI. The comparison to 2015, I think the challenge there is that we had about 150 basis points of things in our 2015 revenue that were unusual. I hesitate to call them one-time, but similar to that one-time items such as we built our occupancy 75 basis points during the year getting to that 96.1% was on average 75% basis points in revenue above the prior year. And then related to that we while we were building occupancy, we also had higher fee performance related to building their occupancy fee as either add fees, processing fees, pet fees all of those things. And also as we've talked about some during the year we've had a little better performance in 2015 in catching some of the final remaining portions of the synergies from our merger. We really had a strong performance in 2015 and the fees, to give you context they grew 15% in 2015 over 2014. We certainly expect to hold a majority of those fees and carry that into 2016, but that growth rate - it would be more of a normalized growth rate going forward. So hope that gives the sum.
H. Eric Bolton: Hey Nick. The takeaway from that is that when you look at 2015 the surprise factor was occupancy and we had anticipated that coming out of 2014 that we would hold the 2014 occupancy which was pretty strong and we didn’t really contemplate seeing occupancy lift as much as it did over the course of 2015. And we and frankly I think many in this sector were surprised at how strong the markets were a last year and I think everybody for the most part was raising guidance over the course of the year. As we got into 2016 guidance were coming off a year where average daily physical occupancy was higher than we've seen in our 22-year history. We ended the fourth quarter with the highest average daily physical occupancy we've ever had. So to go into 2016 within anticipation that we are going to beat that again and get above average daily physical occupancy of 96%, we just were a little hesitate to take that back and we think we are going to hold it. We think that the conditions are great in our markets and great in our region and we think we are going to hold that record occupancy and we think we are going to get very solid rent growth of 4% to 4.5% as well. Again in line with what we saw this past year, but just the incremental lift in occupancy is not expected to repeat itself again in 2016 and that's the big difference between 2016 and 2015.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks that makes sense and then just going back to David's question. What's the impact of the redevelopment spend on 2016 same-store revenue growth and what was the impact on 2015 same-store revenue growth?
H. Eric Bolton: Consistently about 20 basis points to 25 basis points impact pretty consistently.
Nicholas Joseph: Okay, thanks. And then just finally. Can you talk about your performance expectations of the large versus the secondary markets in 2016?
Thomas L. Grimes: I think what we would expect to see is the job growth in the large markets continue to lead the way, absent some sort of macroeconomic change on the demand side, we are expecting those to lead and expecting the Atlanta, Orlando, Phoenix probably to perform top set of that group. In the secondary markets where we get a little less supply, we’re seeing job growth build there and would expect to see places like Charleston, Greenville, and Jacksonville do well. But we would expect that large markets would continue to outperform secondary markets at this point.
H. Eric Bolton: Where the secondary markets really make a huge positive impact to our performance. Nick if you want to start to looking at a real sort of sea change and sort of the leasing environment where either we see a supply get way out of hand and relative to the demand and we get into recessionary environment or we see job growth really start to pull back. That's where the secondary markets really start to hold up a whole while lot better than what you typically see in the larger markets, but at this point in cycle with fundamentals still being strong as Tom was outlining. We think that there still will be a reason for the large markets to continue to outperformance this point the secondary markets.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Gaurav Mehta from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Gaurav Mehta: Hi good morning. I just wanted to back to your comments on acquisitions and disposition, can you speak about cap rate spread that’s expecting between what you are selling and what you are buying?
Albert M. Campbell: Well, if you look at it on a cash flow cap rate basis, certainly just looking what we sold this past year, 21 properties that we sold, the cash flow cap rate was around $5.8, I mean we are buying at around $5.5. So from the cash flow perspective it's pretty close, when you look at sort of NOI yield, initial NOI yield particularly if you assume as we do that some of the acquisitions that we make are still in lease-up and not yet fully stabilized. We gassed out more so, it can be 150 basis points or so. And therefore that’s why from an earnings perspective we've assumed $0.04 to $0.06 of earnings dilution in our guidance predicated on that gap in NOI yield, both as a function of the higher yielding assets that we are selling coupled with the non-stabilized nature of what we assume we’ll be buying.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay and my second question is you mentioned Houston as one of the market that you are monitoring, are there any other market that you are concerned about in 2016 outside of Houston?
Albert M. Campbell: Houston is the one with that demand dynamic that’s traded down. We would like to see a little more job growth come out of Little Rock and Norfolk but we are relatively slightly exposed to those markets, but Houston is the main worry there.
H. Eric Bolton: But no other ones that we are particularly concerned about, I mean when you look at the job growth and the supply dynamics and the ratio between those two they are all well above what would be defined as healthy absorption.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will move next to Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.
Robert Stevenson: Thanks Al. Can you talk about any in terms of the fees what was the gross level of fees in 2015 versus 2014 and what's in the 2006 guidance in terms of the magnitude, in terms of the overall little over billion dollars of revenue that you guys had this year?
Albert M. Campbell: To answer that is it's certainly not in scope as large as the rents and other. It's probably about $50 million and again the majority of growth this year came from of add frees, these processing fees, pet fees and those are the main drivers of growth.
Thomas L. Grimes: [Multiple speaker]. This things associated with increasing occupancies.
Albert M. Campbell: Right, but the large part of that $50 million is you also have water reimbursement, cable reimbursement other thing and the growth came in some of fee related to growth and occupancy this year.
Robert Stevenson: It was like $42 million in 2014 and up $50 million in 2015 and I mean just modest sort of growth in 2016 is how you thinking about it this year?
Albert M. Campbell: Exactly, right exactly right.
Robert Stevenson: Okay and then when you look at the core FFO guidance, when you are sitting here today what is the difference between core and NAREIT from the things that you know today?
Albert M. Campbell: The biggest thing is fair market value of debt adjustment. And the others are acquisition cost and then gains, loss or distinguishment of debt and some small things. But the big number what's driving at difference is really fair market value of debt. And I will tell you Rob, we chose to when we did the merger a couple years ago, we had that significant number for that. We chose to pulled back out of AFFO, because it's non-cash and we are getting an credit and interest. And we just feel like it was better to show it without that because it's not cash and so some other people do it defiantly, we know it's a little bit confusing, but that’s the main difference and we will continue to do that until that burns. It will burn off in another couple of years and tat significant difference should decline.
Robert Stevenson: Okay and then lastly what is the 100 basis points of turnover cost, turnover goes up 100 or 200 basis points this year. How do you think about that impacting the expense side equation?
Albert M. Campbell: Usually about $0.01 to $0.015 per percent on that Rob, I mean it's meaningful to our business in terms of the actual impact of AFFO given the size and scale of the company, its smaller than you would think.
Thomas L. Grimes: So 1% quite stood a penny and a half roughly of AFFO.
Robert Stevenson: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our question from Dan Oppenheim from Zelman & Associate. Your line is open.
Daniel Oppenheim: I was wondering if you can talk a little more in terms of large and secondary market, I think comments about large - performing here in 2016 kindly I think we will look some of the trends recently in terms of that I think that will continue. But you mentioned Houston in terms of challenges but the number of other larger markets where there is more supply coming and wondering how you think about that in terms of not so much as the absolute level but the level of deceleration that could come through in large markets versus in the secondary markets?
H. Eric Bolton: Dan, since what we are seeing as in large the 2015 looks an awful lot - 2016 looks an awful lot like 2015. It should fill down the way we keep - try to keep in mind the balance between demand and supply, the jobs to completion ratio and they are at about seven for both years in a row and job growth 2015 for that combination of markets is 27 and it's about the same for 2016. I think related to our portfolio specifically, this has been worn out in the media I think a little bit but it is true the demand in some of these large markets is coming into the urban areas where we have a little less - the supply is coming in where there are a little less exposure important clarification there. thank you. Where we've got a little more and the inner loop satellite cities and suburban like exposure.
Daniel Oppenheim: Got it. And then in terms of you talked about the blended rent growth of 5% in January, curious in terms of where the or you see in terms of the renewals that you are sending out that it went out for February and March versus the new leases?
Albert M. Campbell: Yes sure, we are getting about 6% on the renewals through March.
Daniel Oppenheim: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll move next to Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Your line is now open.
Thomas Lesnick: First question. You have been obviously made improvement in people expertise in the secondary markets over the last year. But looking at average effective rent per unit obviously large, so [indiscernible] secondary by a pretty wide margin. I'm just wondering is there some limiting factor in the secondary markets like personal income growth that's keeping that number down or is that a strategic decision on your part to keep secondary market a little bit lower to push occupancy this year and is that something we could expect to see you guys push on the rent side now that occupancy is at 96%?
H. Eric Bolton: Sure. Tom and affordability in secondary's and non-issue, it's actually we have better rent to income ratios in secondary been in large in both - we’re talking a 100 basis points difference went roughly $17.5, $16.5 so not materially different, but it's a non issue there and I think now it’s a real balance on rent and occupancy. And one links to the other as demand in secondary looks very good at this point, occupancy in January average physical is actually higher now in secondary than large and we are in very good shape on our exposure, so we are optimistic about rents in secondary at this point.
Thomas L. Grimes: What I would also tell you Tom is that to some degree the spread and average rent between our large and secondary segment of our portfolios of function are the fact that we have I think a higher percentage of older properties. Some of the legacy assets that we've owned for a long time are in some of the secondary markets. Now that's changing and that's evolving as we continue to build out our presence in markets like Kansas City, San Antonio and Fredericksburg. Some of these newer markets that we've been getting into with newer assets. But when you look at the age of the assets across the portfolio, we have percentage wise a higher concentration of older legacy assets to some of the secondary markets and I think that probably accounts for some of that pricing spread that you are mentioning.
Thomas Lesnick: Got it. And then looking at same-store operating expenses the dispersion of year-over-year comps in the secondary markets is pretty wide. This quarter I was just wondering, if there is anything in particular that was kind of driving the dispersion there across all of this secondary markets?
H. Eric Bolton: Texas is one factor in it and then Charleston obviously stands out, we had a weather event in Charleston where you probably read about it tons of rain there and we didn’t have any material damage, actually no units down or anything like that. But we did have a fair amount of landscape work that had to occur in that market during the fourth quarter just drying things out replacing some damages.
H. Eric Bolton: I think in aggregate, it was probably real estate taxes drove.
Albert M. Campbell: That’s a lot of the credits came in the Texas markets which are all in our - expect the San Antonio large segment.
Thomas Lesnick: And then one final question. Now with occupancy over 96%. Looking at where we stood relative to last year, how is your average day return time changed over the last year or so?
H. Eric Bolton: Average days return is with that is down 2.5 days, we would expect to drop another two next year. I think the thing that probably modes the best for revenues is that exposure at the end of January is down a 120 basis points and that's sort of the leading edge of our pricing power.
Thomas Lesnick: Great. Thanks guys, I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Will move next to Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.
Drew Babin: Good morning, guys. First question, one Phase III you really outperformed the expectations in 2015 was property tax expense growth and the initial guidance for the year is - seems that also this year 4.5% to 5%, you hit that the low end of that ad I know this was in the third quarter, you had some successful appeals both in terms of [indiscernible]. What you are assuming for 2016 with your forecast in terms of whether you can qualify kind of win percentage any assessments and could that - what’s the potential for that number to possibly come in at the lower end of the range?
Albert M. Campbell: I’ll try to give you some color on that Drew, I think what happens in the begging of the year in year, you just don’t have a lot of information to go on, you talk to assessors, get a feel for what is happening in each jurisdiction and you start your estimates. As you move into second quarter, you have a little more information, third a lot and fourth you finalize I think that’s this year. And so what happened last year as we start out the pressure was coming from Texas, Florida a little bit in Georgia as we have some revaluations occurring there. But we start out the year with expectation in 2015 really high numbers come out of Texas. Particularly in third quarter we started to get some information believing that was going to moderate low bit in the fourth quarter, we got that finalized notice and so that’s why it came down in 2015. Looking into 2016, we are still getting very high numbers out of Texas and then we got some revaluation in Georgia and some in Florida. I would tell where we sit today, we expect to think about especially what they do, they are doing evaluation of assessments of 2016 looking backward to 2015. Record year for the company in many areas and so we expect those initial violations come out high and we expect to jump on early, hopefully have some success. We have some success in fighting what we think will come out built in our numbers, but hopefully we will meet that and even be able to have more success. But I’ll tell right now given the performance we had in 2015 the valuations are base off of income, it's hard to see those taxes begin the moderate significantly until the cycle changes. And so that’s what we are projecting to 2016.
Drew Babin: Okay and one more, despite the fact that that costs had likely bottomed both on secured and unsecured side, private equity remains pretty aggressive and within cap rates lower. As we look at the accretion between their cost of capital and what they are paying for assets. Are you hearing anything from private players that you talk to about LTVs debt rates that they are able to get to kind of feel this? just curious if you have any color there or anything that’s maybe a read through that you are looking at acquisition to obviously with lower leverage levels?
Albert M. Campbell: We continue to see private capital securing loan to values in 70% to 75% range pretty easily and the agencies remain very active and coming out of the national multifamily housing councils annual meeting back in January that mean all the feedback and all the information that we got is that probably capital. Both domestic and foreign indicates a huge appetite for multifamily real estate. It appears that the financing windows are wide open very much from a loan to value perspective very much consistent will what we saw in 2015. I think that despite the slight bump that the Feds made in interest rates earlier. The expectation is that rates are going to continue to remain pretty low this year. So from our perspective it's really hard to see how the valuation market is going to change much, I think it's going to another active year, another fueled by a lot of investor interest. I think the only thing that potentially is going to evolve is I just think it maybe more deal flow, I think there may be more transactions in the market than we have seen in 2015. But I think it will still be a very robust environment.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital. Your line is open.
Wes Golladay: You gave the color on the renewal leases for January, what you seeing on the new lease?
Albert M. Campbell: New leases in January on a year-over-year basis were [49] (Ph).
Wes Golladay: Okay and then you guys mentioned you record occupancy, do you plan to be more aggressive on the renewal leasing, I guess at least in the near term? And can you verify, you guys are backing in essentially flat rate growth or the similar rate growth versus last year?
H. Eric Bolton: Yes, our rate growth we expect to be very much in line with 2015 and that’s sort of that’s backed in.
Thomas L. Grimes: And then our pricing approach is more aggressive at this time this year than it was last year both because of the factor of lower exposure and system automatically relates that. But we are also managing the system at appropriate level, at a market level, at a core plan level depending on the time of the year and the cycle and we are more aggressive on our settings this year than we were at this time last year.
Wes Golladay: Okay so if we were to pick a point where you guys are probably surprise with the upset, would that be there you think you will come from?
Thomas L. Grimes: Probably but most likely.
Wes Golladay: Okay and then you mentioned more deal flow for the acquisitions now would this be more of the urban core properties you are you looking for? And are you seeing any developers get in trouble yet, are they just seeing capital markets in the stock market and might bring to the table?
Albert M. Campbell: Well, we are not particularly targeting more sort of urban core, what I would tell you is that’s where so much of the supply is being delivered that I think if that’s where the opportunities will emerge as some of these lease-ups run into trouble or they are not leasing either at the velocity or the rents that they had pro forma. So I just think that it’s a stock that’s continues to play out that’s more than likely where the opportunities will emerge. We are not seeing what I would consider to be real operating distress or lease-up distress frankly where we see our opportunities are where we see private capital come in tie up a deal on very, very aggressive terms and then running to some kind of a problem in getting the financing or they don’t get loan proceeds equivalent to what they thought they were going to get and they you go back to the developer to try to re-trade the deal and developer sort of blows up and then they come back to us. And so every deal we bought last year was on a rebound and I think that from an operating perspective we are not seeing any real weakness yet but I just think as the deal flow picks up we think that may very well yields to increase opportunity.
Wes Golladay: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Will take our next question from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Tayo Okusanya: I may have miss this earlier but could you talk a little bit about the timing in 2016 of the acquisitions versus the dispositions?
Albert M. Campbell: We have the acquisitions - we’re projecting pretty evenly spread throughout the year Tayo beginning somewhere in March maybe a $40 million to $50 million a month through call it Octobers and then the dispositions a little bit more towards the mid to back part of the year really looking to match fund those as much as we can as Eric mentioned in the start of the call and so you can kind of start at midpoint of the year and layer those in.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay, that helps. And then same-store NOI growth in the fourth quarter versus 3Q there is a material slowdown in secondary markets again markets like Little Rock, Arkansas that you mentioned and transaction in Mississippi and some of these other smaller markets Huntsville, Alabama, could you kind of talk specifically about what's happening in of the secondary markets that there was the slowdown?
Albert M. Campbell: And Tayo I mean it's a good observation that a transition from third quarter to fourth quarter a little bit lower on revenue and there is a seasonal factor to these markets and I don’t think it is odd to see them drop down. So either way going from third quarter to fourth quarter, there is lower traffic, there is lower demand and that pattern has repeated itself over the years with us and as usual we see good pick back up with the beginning in the year in those markets the secondary markets average physical occupancy for January is 96.6 so we've seen pop up there so I would expect that what you are observing is not change from the market dynamics, but seasonality as we move from third quarter to fourth quarter and mostly it will come back.
Tayo Okusanya: I don’t think they have dropped so much more versus the primary markets. Which is kind of what I was trying to get out.
Albert M. Campbell: Sure. And I think that's a difference in households moving to those markets, the secondary markets are in the fourth quarter they are just a little bit slower and you have lot more going on and they are large markets.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay. And then just last one from me. Just Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina were still good job growth particularly increasing the concern about supply. Could you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing then what's your outlook is for 2016?
Albert M. Campbell: Charlotte in particular is an urban suburban story a little bit and looking at the amount of product it's coming in South Church area is noticeable, there is a lot happening there, so a lot less happening in suburbs and that is where the majority of our exposure is. So we like the job growth and on the product that we have in Charlotte it is there is not a lot of comps going in next forward to it. Similar story in Raleigh, over the last couple of years we saw fair amount of the supply coming in and the prior Brier Creek submarket where we exposed it's one of those appealing submarkets but that has burned off and it's shifted more to Downtown as well where we have one asset.
Tayo Okusanya: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our final question today from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.
Jordan Sadler: Hi guys good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just kind of big picture I know you mentioned move outs for home purchases decline in the fourth quarter, but we have seen that sort of nationwide tick up a bit. Is there any concern that moves out around purchases could start to increase particularly in your more suburban locations.
Albert M. Campbell: Honestly there is no sign of that and that is something that's trended down pretty much every quarter this year and there doesn’t seem to be an interest both in and sort of psychology and lifestyle reasons that people are interested in moving at this point, we’re just simply not seeing that.
Jordan Sadler: What sort of the average age, I guess when you look across the portfolio of your renters?
Albert M. Campbell: We’re right at 38.
Tayo Okusanya: That's helpful. And then just lastly I was just curious when you think about the dispositions, how are you kind of coming through the portfolio and ranking I guess potential candidates for sale and how does that balance out between your large and secondary markets?
H. Eric Bolton: We take a look every year at every individual investment we have and we look at sort of the acted CapEx cash flow being generated off the investment and what it likely is going to trend out at over the next few years. And make a decision on which ones do we think are going to yield us the weakest or declining if you will cash flow and target those as ones that we need to recycle cap out of into something more compelling. I think that we do this several year and we sold over 13,000 apartments in the last five years and so we take a very proactive approach to keeping certain level of recycling taking place every year. As we look at 2016 should the investment opportunity show up and then presents an opportunity to recycle money out of some investments, I would expect 2016 to be sort of evenly we split between both large and secondary markets, we have a good mix in both.
Tayo Okusanya: Great. Thanks for the detail.
Operator: And it looks like we do have a follow-up, we will go back to Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Your line is open.
Tom Lesnick: Just one quick question. Looking at the acquisition for the quarter up to $79 million, how much is allocated to the non NOI producing Denton Phase II piece?
Albert M. Campbell: Sorry, how much is going non same stores there were no Denton…
Tom Lesnick: No the Denton Phase II development sight, how much of that $79 million…
Albert M. Campbell: Okay that was smaller, let’s say the number allocated to that was about $10 million its smaller, 55 units in smaller so about $10 million of that.
Tom Lesnick: Okay and are you guys able to provide cap rate anything on the acquisition that are actually produce in NOI at this point?
Albert M. Campbell: I think what I would say is once they are stabilized we would say five and a quarter likely, but obviously those aren’t stabilized but that’s the projection once they are stabilized.
Tom Lesnick: Okay, appreciate it thanks.
Operator: And we have no further questions. I’ll like to turn the call back to Tim Argo for any closing remarks today.
Timothy P. Argo: No further comments. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-10-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating in the MAA Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, we would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Wolfgang. Miss Wolfgang, you may begin.
Leslie Wolfgang: Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Corporate Secretary for MAA. Tim Argo, our VP of Finance who normally introduces our quarterly earnings call cannot be with us this morning as he and his wife are awaiting the birth of their first child. We're excited to welcome the newest addition to the MAA family and we send them all our best. I do have with me Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our '34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. When we reach the question-and-answer portion of the call, I would ask for everyone to please limit their questions to no more than two in order to give everyone ample opportunity to participate. Should you have additional questions, please re-renter the queue or you're certainly welcome to follow-up with us after we conclude the call. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Leslie. Third quarter performance was strong and record high performance in both core, FFO and AFFO per share. The results were driven by record high effective occupancy and solid rent growth producing an 8.1% increase in same store NOI on top of last year's very solid NOI growth of 6.8%. After a busy couple of years of merger and integration activities, the MAA team has our operating and reporting platform in a strong position. I want to express my thanks and my appreciation for their hard work and tremendous results. Leasing conditions across our Sunbelt markets continued to support high occupancy and solid rent growth. We believe our strategy in diversifying capital across this high growth region with a production and a price point focused on serving a broad segment of the rental market enables MAA to capture the strong demand of the region, while mitigating to some degree new supply pressures. We continue to see positive leasing momentum across the portfolio, job growth in most of our markets, particularly in the large market segment of the portfolio, coupled with management levels of new supply particularly in our secondary markets should combine to produce another year of positive leasing and pricing trends in 2016. As outlined in our recently published report by the Urban Land Institute on the Gen Y generation and their housing preferences, positive demographic trends should continue to generate growing demand for apartment housing, particularly in our Southeaster and Sunbelt markets. As outlined in the ULI study, a clear majority or 62% of this renter demographic identify themselves as residing in the south and west. Interestingly, the millennial group also described themselves as being essentially equally weighted in their focus on living in the city versus living in the suburbs, and importantly, only 13% of this millennial generation, according to the ULI study identify themselves as living in or near downtown areas. In our South-eastern markets, it's important to remember that a lot of the employment centers and more appealing entertainment venues that create proximity demand for apartment housing are often located in more suburban or satellite municipalities and not in the downtown CBD or heavy urban submarkets, and further with the median rent for the Gen Y group at $925 per month per the ULI study, we believe our product holds appeal in terms of price point and as a result is well positioned to attract this larger renter demographic. Overall, we continue to believe MAA's focused portfolio strategy reconciles very well with this growing renter profile and supports our goal to deliver superior full cycle performance. The meaningful reposition that we've accomplished with the portfolio over the past five years is making an increasing impact as we've continued to recycle capital from some of our older investments and captured attractive internal rates of return upon sale, we've been able to repopulate the portfolio with newer properties that have enabled us to capture a steady improvement in NOI margins, particularly on an after CapEx basis. Over the past five years, MAA's same store NOI margin on an after CapEx basis has improved 590 basis points. We expect to capture continued improvement in margins as our lease-up pipeline, new development pipeline and redevelopment pipeline continue to drive higher margin performance into the same store portfolio. On the transaction front, robust deal flow and strong investor appetite continues to generate a lot of activity, along with aggressive pricing. We have a number of opportunities we are reviewing and continue to remain patient and disciplined with our underwriting. As you'll note in our update guidance, we have pulled back a little on the volume of acquisitions that we expect to complete this year, but I continue to believe that more attractive buying opportunities will emerge as we work through the cycle. As Al will detail in his comments, through a combination of asset sales, internally generated free cash flow, reworking our credit facility and further deleveraging the balance sheet, we have added more strength to the balance sheet and meaningfully expanded the Company's external growth capacity. We remain poised to execute on attractive opportunities as they emerge. That's all I have and I'm going to turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas Grimes: Thank you, Eric and good morning, everyone. Revenues for the quarter grew 6.1% over the prior year and 2.3% sequentially. Our record results were driven by a year-over-year increase in revenue per occupied unit of 5.1% to $1,123 and a 90 basis point increase in average physical occupancy. October trends continue to be steady. Our 60 day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60 day period is just 7.1%, down 70 basis points from the same time last year. October blended rents on a year-over-year basis are up 4.8%. Overall, expenses remain in line, up just 3%. The only item that ran ahead of expectations was our personnel cost, as the strong revenue results are driving higher than expected performance based compensation. Personnel costs less incentives were up just 2.2%. On the market front, the vibrant job growth in the large markets is driving strong revenue results. 11 of our 13 markets exceeded 5% revenue growth. They were led by Atlanta, Orlando, Phoenix and Fort Worth. The secondary markets which have lower supply pressure achieved 5.2% revenue growth. In these markets, we're benefiting from improved job growth as well as a sophisticated operating platform that has competitive advantages across our footprint and markets. Revenue growth in Greenville, Charleston, Savannah and Jacksonville stood out. Turnover for the quarter was again down, decreasing by 1.7% over the prior year, and down 100 basis points on a rolling 12 month basis to 53.3%. Move outs to home buying were just 19.1% of total move outs and well below historic norms. Move outs to home rentals were down 6% and represent less than 8% of our total move outs. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupancy again paid off. The improvement in average days vacant helped drive the record average physical occupancy for the quarter to 96.6%. Year-to-date, we've completed 4,200 interior unit upgrades, 2,300 of which were on legacy CLP communities. We're on pace to redevelop 5,000 units this year and expect the mix to favor the legacy CLP portfolio. As a reminder, on average, we spent $4,500 per unit and receive $100 rent increase over our comparable non-renovated unit, which generates a year one return well in excess of 20%. Our four active lease-up communities are performing well, 220 Riverside is now 70% occupied and 84% leased. It's on schedule to stabilize in the second quarter of 2016. Colonial Grand at Bellevue II -- Phase II, and the Retreat at West Creek, are 92.3% and 94% occupied and will both stabilize in the fourth quarter. Finally our newest acquisition in lease-up, Skysong in Scottsdale is 89% occupied and on schedule to stabilize in the first quarter of next year. On the customer service front, our recommend score on ApartmentRatings.com, which is currently the dominant rating site for multifamily reviews improved for the sixth straight quarter. With Eric's comments about millennials in mind, we invite you to take a look at our redesigned website. This platform was built to continue our appeal to millennials in the way they prefer to search. Our URL structures and content management system were tweaked to strengthen our search engine strategy. Simply put, this means our website shows up higher on their search list without paying for higher placement. Once the website was improved our page views increased by five times which gives us more leads at a lower cost per lead. In addition I think you'll find it visually bold and easy to navigate. Al?
Albert Campbell: Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the Company's third quarter earnings performance and balance sheet activity and then on the revised guidance for the full year. FSO for the third quarter was $1.44 per share. Core FFO, which excludes certain non-cash and non-routine items was $1.38 per share. Recurring capital expenditures for the quarter were $15.8 million or $0.20 per share which produced Core AFFO of $1.18 per share providing strong coverage of our $0.77 per share quarterly dividend. For the full year, core AFFO grew 11.3% over the prior year. The outperformance for the quarter was primarily produced by same-store NOI growth driven by record high average occupancy levels of 90 basis points above prior year and continued strong fee collections. Favorable real estate tax appeals and reduced insurance reserves [indiscernible] claims experience also contributed to the strong earnings performance. During the third quarter, we acquired two new communities for a total investment of $86.6 million. These purchases bring our full year investment and acquisitions to $244.4 million for five new communities containing 1,409 units. We also funded an additional $10.5 million on development costs on our four communities under construction during the quarter leaving only $54 million of the $120 million total expected cost to be funded. We expect NOI yields in the 7% to 7.5% range on these communities once completed and stabilized. We also invested $8.2 million in our interior renovation program during the quarter, bringing our full year investment in the program to just over $19 million for 4,209 units renovated. As Tom mentioned, we continue to capture strong rent increases above non-renovated units, which are projected to produce unleveraged returns of 14%. During the quarter, we sold three communities for gross proceeds of $121 million and recorded book gains of $54.7 million. These three sales bring year to date dispositions to 21 properties averaging 26 years of age for $354.3 million gross proceeds producing $109 million in recorded gains. The average cap rate for these dispositions was 5.8% based on last 12 months NOI, a 4% management fee and actual CapEx, which produced an average 14.1% return on our invested equity of the full life of these investments. Our balance sheet ended the quarter in a very strong position, with leverage levels continuing to climb and coverage ratios growing further. At quarter end, our leverage defined as total net debt to gross assets was 39.9%, 140 basis points below the prior year. While our debt to recurring EBITDA was only 5.76 times, a record low for the Company. Our current EBITDA continues to grow and reflect the quality of our earnings profile, covering our fixed charges over 4.2 times. Following the end of the quarter, we recast our unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing our borrowing capacity to $750 million from $500 million, extending the maturity to 4.5 years and improving the terms to reflect our stronger credit profile. This new credit facility supported by [indiscernible] provides significant liquidity and growth capacity for the Company. In conjunction with the new credit facility, we amended our $150 million term loan also improving terms and extending the maturity date. For the current year, we expect to produce about $80 million to $85 million of internal free cash flow, which is essentially core FFO less all CapEx and common dividend payments. This is expect to grow just over $100 million for 2016, and given this free cash flow, production and the completed dispositions, our 2015 plans do not include new equity. We currently have over $420 million of total cash and credit available under our credit line, and we expect to end the year with our leverage about 100 basis points below the prior year numbers. Finally, due to the strong operating performance during the third quarter, we are raising our guidance for core FFO and AFFO for the full year. We're now projecting core FFO for the year to be $5.39 to $5.49 per share or $5.44 at the midpoint representing a 9% growth over the prior year. Core AFFO is now projected to be $4.71 to $4.81 per share or $4.76 at the midpoint, representing an 11.2% growth from the prior year. Same store NOI growth is now expected to be 6% to 7%, based on revenue growth of 5% to 6% and expense growth of 3.5% to 4.5%. Our expected acquisition volume for the year is now $300 million to $400 million. That's all I have. So, now, I'll turn the call over to Eric for closing comments.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Al. MAA's strong performance this year reflects both the favorable leasing conditions across our regional footprint as well as the benefits from our merger with Colonial Properties that closed two years ago this month. The value proposition that we identified at the time we announced the merger including both stated expense synergies as well as incremental revenue opportunities have been fully realized, and are on track to be exceeded. We believe, we have the portfolio, the operating platform and the balance sheet, all well-positioned for what we expect to be both continued favorable leasing conditions and increasing our opportunities to capture new value growth as we had into 2016. That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Kevin, we'll turn it back to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. For the fourth quarter implied same-store revenue growth guidance of 4.6% at the midpoint, can you walk through the underlying assumptions for occupancy, rent growth and the fee income?
Albert Campbell: Absolutely Nick. This is Al, and I think, as we look at the fourth quarter, the story really has continued, pricing trends that we've seen this year. We're going to have a little tougher comps on occupancy and fees and revenues and that will fall to the bottom line about the 4.5 to 4.6 kind of implied midpoint, pricing in the 4 to 4.5 range. We do expect to pick up a little bit of occupancy year-over-year now from the high levels we have now, but the comp will become tougher and then combine it with the fees that will fall down to the 4.5, 4.6 implied on revenue growth.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Then, can you remind me if the units in the redevelopment program are included in the same-store pool?
Albert Campbell: They are. Our policy is, unless we do a renovation and it substantially disturbs or causes a very lengthy disturbance to the performance we leave it in same store and for annual basis, I think, it would be probably a 40 basis point or 50 basis point impact on a full-year basis each year.
Nick Joseph: Thanks, just last question. I'd like to get your thoughts on the transaction market today, both for the large and secondary markets, if you're seeing more opportunities with stabilized assets or with the presale opportunities.
Eric Bolton: Nick, this is Eric. I would tell you, most of where we see opportunities on the presale -- are sale of pre-stabilized situations or in some cases new development that's trying to get started and looking for capital. We continue to not spend a lot of time chasing after fully stabilized situations. Those are much more easier financed and that's where we see pricing, really the toughest. From our perspective, we're not going to go out and compete in a market based on price. We're looking to capture some value for our ability to execute for the seller, whether it is urgency of close or the ability to handle some complexity or the ability to not have to worry about some the financing issues that often a lot of these buyers in these markets are depending on. So, most of what we're after at this point is pre-stabilized situations.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is now open.
Robert Stevenson: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Al, what's the current thinking in terms of property tax increases? I mean, are we past the big increases and they start normalizing over the next year or so and you talked about the incentive comp for employees, anything else expense wise on the horizon that's likely to have a major impact on the same store expenses going forward?
Albert Campbell: I think, those are the two main items Rob and just on taxes, as we've talked about for a while, the pressure that has been over the last few years really from Texas and Florida, as we began this year, Texas came out very aggressive with their assessments and so we dialed that into our number and really worked hard in the field, virtually every property in Texas, and had some favourability in the third quarter because we were successful on that and also as they came out with the actual rates, the millage rates, you have the evaluation and rates, the rates came in a little lower growth than we'd expected as well. So that's certainly benefited the third quarter. As we talked about in our insurance reserves, we're so self-insured for some of our reserves. I mean, our client experience has been a little better and we thought that benefitted us a little bit. So, those are two things in the third quarter. I don't expect any significant -- I think in the fourth quarter you won't have that credit from real estate taxes impacting the fourth quarter and it's a pretty big component of your expenses, but full year, we expect Texas to rise, 5%. The last year, it was 6%. Next year, who knows, but we would expect as we've been saying for a while, continued slight moderation over the next few years until it eventually gets down to the 3% long-term average that it's been over time, but that may take a couple of years.
Robert Stevenson: Okay, and then in terms of -- the same store revenue growth has essentially been sort of turbocharged relative to the peer group by the occupancy increases this year. I mean, it seems like you're going to be hard-pressed to even keep occupancy at sort of 96.6%, let alone increase it from here. How should we be thinking about same-store revenue growth over the next five, six quarters without the benefit of an occupancy tailwind?
Eric Bolton: Well, Rob, this is Eric. We're not prepared to give 2016 guidance at this point, but what I can tell you is that based on everything that we see, the leasing environment should remain as robust as what we've seen this year. We think that it's going to continue to support very solid occupancy performance. We think that the strong occupancy performance that we've captured this year, we likely will be able to continue to hold it. We don't see any material deterioration in occupancy by any means, and we think that we can do that, while also getting rent growth that's going to be pretty comparable to what we've been seeing this year. I think that some of the lift that we got this year from merger-related activities will begin to moderate a little bit. We'll hold those performance levels, but an incremental lift will become a little bit more difficult, because we're -- as you say, we're member essentially full. I mean, a lot of the performance lift that we got this year and frankly, some of the surprise in the third quarter was some of the great work that Tom and his team are doing on managing our days vacancy between turns and they've made some significant improvement in that over the course of this year, and again we think we'll carry that going into next year, but incremental improvement will be a little bit more difficult.
Robert Stevenson: Okay, thanks guys.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Rob.
Operator: Our next question comes from Conor Wagner with Green Street. Your line is now open.
Conor Wagner: Good morning. Al, you mentioned that the benefit from the redevelopment activity will be about 50 bps to same-store revenue growth this year. Do you have an estimate for what it was in '13 and '14?
Albert Campbell: Probably similar to that but we've been doing that program for several years Conor. I'd say pretty close, probably a little over, because we'd increased the program this year, but somewhere in that call it, 40 basis point to 50 basis point range [indiscernible].
Conor Wagner: That's helpful and then, on the reduction in frictional vacancy, is there -- is that portfolio wide or is there more of a benefit there with the Colonial Properties?
Eric Bolton: It is weighed a little bit heavily on the Colonial side, but we've picked up improvement everywhere, but weighed a little higher there as our approach to monitoring and managing the components of the average days vacant have come to play on that portfolio.
Conor Wagner: Then just a follow up on that. Is that more -- is it advertising? Is it how you get the unit done? Is the time just based on better leasing or is it better job that you guys are actually doing the work to turn the unit as far as cleaning or any necessary repairs?
Eric Bolton: It's really a combination of those things. We reduced the amount of time that it took to physically turn the unit. That doesn't do you any good if you didn't lease it faster, and we've really had to focus on pre-leasing the unit and locking in those days early. So, we were able to pre-lease a larger portion of our units and lock in a lower timeframe.
Conor Wagner: Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thank you, good morning. You guys have talked a lot about aggressive pricing on acquisitions, cap rates, I think you've mentioned it's been in the low 5% range. So, I was just curious about your thoughts on what type of growth you think that apartment investors are underwriting today.
Eric Bolton: I don't know what they're underwriting. I mean, I don't know because I don't know what their return expectations are. I mean, obviously to some degree they're taking advantage of the very low interest rate environment to -- there's a cost to capital benefit that they're dialling into their assumption. So, it's hard to know and of course it's going to vary quite a bit. I think by market and by my property. I think that you can see some of these the more stabilized value add opportunities where there's a repositioning play and I'm certain that people get pretty aggressive on their assumptions as to what they can do there. You take something that's brand-new whether it's really not a redevelopment or a repurposing of the interiors or anything of that nature and market expectations will vary based on the market and so, I don't know. It's hard to know what expectations are of any particular investor, I mean, from our perspective, you know, we we've been in these markets for a long time. We feel like we have a pretty good handle on what they can do over a long period of time and we apply that logic to any situation we look at, but, it's hard to know what they're thinking.
Austin Wurschmidt: That's fair, and then as you guys are trolling for new acquisitions given your comments on sort of suburban living in your markets, is there any submarkets or anywhere you are particularly focused today on the acquisitions side?
Eric Bolton: We like -- really, we like most all the markets that we're in right now and you whether it's in Dallas, whether it's in McKinney, Frisco, Las Colinas, Plano area but let me also add, I mean, we're also interested in continuing to explore opportunities as they emerge in some of the more traditional downtown or CBD areas as well. As you know, that's where a lot of supply is being delivered into the marketplace and we think that may be very well where some of the best buying opportunities emerge over the next year or so. Ultimately, what we're after is we're after a balance portfolio. We're deploying capital with a long-term horizon associated with it. We're looking to build a portfolio of assets that will deliver steady growing cash flow, and so having a blend of both the downtown, the inner loop, satellite city, traditional suburban we're interested in keeping a balance of all that.
Austin Wurschmidt: Thanks and then just last one for me is, how did the October rent growth stack up versus last year?
Thomas Grimes: It was about flat with last year at 4.8%, similar to Q3 and flat with October of last year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.
Richard Anderson: Thanks. Good morning and great quarter. If I could just clarify the redevelopment impact on same-store is a positive 50 basis points, not negative because of down time?
Thomas Grimes: Correct, and Rich, we only take about seven extra days to do a renovate versus a non-renovate. So that is not much of a drag.
Richard Anderson: Okay. So, now it doesn't qualify for one of my two questions. So Eric, did you have any look or any knowledge of the EQR asset sale and if so can you talk about that and or the benefits in general of just being bigger than you are already today?
Eric Bolton: Well no. We didn't know about it and I'm certain we'd not have been a viable candidate for that transaction. The benefits of being bigger, I mean, within our footprint, we see and know about every deal that comes to market. We certainly are seeing a lot of opportunity and we're getting approached more so than we ever have in the past about not only one-off opportunities but bigger opportunities as well, and I think that just being in the markets that we're in now and being bigger in those markets, I mean, there are certain efficiencies that we have as a consequence from an operating perspective of some of the things that Tom and his team have done, have clearly enabled us to make some headway in terms of our operating margins, coupled with the recycling that we've done. So, I think that there's clearly some benefit that we feel like we're creating for shareholder capital, for both the legacy CLP shareholders and MAA shareholders as a consequence of the scaling up that we've done.
Richard Anderson: Right, but I'm really talking about entity level type, getting way bigger type of as opposed to one off type stuff.
Thomas Grimes: I'm sorry. Are you asking, are we interested in getting way bigger?
Richard Anderson: Yeah.
Thomas Grimes: No. To answer your question, no, not really.
Richard Anderson: Okay, and then to the other side of that, can you comment at all your input on some of the private equity interest in multifamily? To what degree you sense some interest in your stock to any type of color that you can get from the private side would be interesting.
Thomas Grimes: You know, I mean, I think there's clearly a lot of evidence that private capital has a huge appetite for apartment real estate and as evidenced by some of the transactions that have been announced over the last few weeks, I mean, clearly there's a buy into the Southeast markets and there's a buy into not only some of the more urban oriented locations, but suburban assets as well. So, I would just say there's lot interest and we like what we're doing. We like the portfolio that we have. We feel like we're hitting on all cylinders right now, but I mean, clearly there's a lot of interest out there.
Richard Anderson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
John Kim: Good morning. I was interested in your remarks on your prepared comments on the reduced move outs to home rental and home buying. I know it's just one quarter, but why do you think this is occurring in your markets at this point in the cycle?
Eric Bolton: It's been pretty consistently that way this year, honestly. Home buying has bounced in the 18% to 19.5% as a reason for move outs and home renting really never caught hold and is moving back. I mean, it's a large drop percentage-wise but it's not very many units. So, to me, John, honestly, it's a little more of the same old same old.
John Kim: Okay, and then in this quarter, Houston held up relatively well, but with weaker sequential rental growth as your other markets. Have you noticed anything in the last quarter or so as far as increased turnover or slow releasing velocity [ph]?
Eric Bolton: Yes, I'll just give you a Houston update. At this point, it's just 3% of our portfolio and as you point out, it did well. Turnover is actually well down. Turnover for Houston was down 10% with almost -- with home buying at that market dropping significantly. We expect it to remain above 95%, but do expect new lease rents to soften a bit. So, new lease rents are about flat. Renewals through the end of the year are up 4%. That's different than it has been in the prior six months. Job growth there is lower than it's been, but positive for '16 and I think, at this point, absent some sort of recovery in oil and gas with the amount of new supply occurring that you would expect rents to be under pressure for a little while.
John Kim: On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being very concerned and 1 not concerned at all, where would you rate Houston?
Eric Bolton: 6, maybe. Something like that. I mean, I don't -- I think we're going to see it soften and on rents I think we'll hold on to occupancy. I can't predict the oil and gas futures market. I just don't have that club in my bag. So, that will depend, but in a long term, we love it and it will produce opportunity. If it drops off further than we expect, it'll produce a buying opportunity for us. We've got plenty of room in our portfolio to add in Houston, if the opportunity is there.
John Kim: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital. Your line is now open.
Wes Golladay: Good morning, everyone. Excellent quarter. Sticking with the topic of softening markets, are there any other markets where you're seeing the initial signs of softening?
Eric Bolton: No. Honestly, Houston is the one sort of worry bead for us at a material level.
Wes Golladay: Okay, and then, with the strong leasing environment, is it harder to negotiate with the developers or are they just still looking to move on to the next project? Can you give us a sense of deal volume and your close rate versus prior quarters?
Eric Bolton: It's been pretty consistent, Wes. I mean, the deal volume is pretty high. Close rates are pretty low. We're seeing a lot of opportunity. I think that, we're going to have to see -- developers are still holding pretty strong right now with their asset pricing. So I think that the fundamentals of being as strong as they are and continuing to be as strong as they are is -- we haven't seen any real movement in cap rates or any real sense that pricing is starting to soften in any way.
Wes Golladay: Okay, thanks for taking the question and keep up the good work.
Thomas Grimes: Thanks Wes.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Wes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Gaurav Mehta: Thank you. Good morning. Going back to the transaction market, can you comment on what you're seeing for the older assets that you have sold so far? Is there room to maybe sell more than what you've sold?
Eric Bolton: We feel like -- I mean, the appetite's very good out there for really any apartment real estate right now, whether it be brand-new or slightly older. Having said that, we took advantage of it and we sold 21 assets year and only picked up five thus far. So, huge net sell this year. We like where we have a portfolio at this point. We exited 11 markets -- 11 tertiary markets. We very much believe in the same strategy that we've had for some time. We like the markets that we're in. We like the split between large and secondary markets. So, we're not after any sort of -- we've done the transformation that we're after and when you look over the last five years, as I've mentioned, we've sold over 13,000 apartments. So, we've accomplished a lot of the repositioning that we are after. I mean, going forward, we will continue to obviously always look at opportunities to recycle capital where we can create better returns on that capital for the long-term, but we'll be in a position to be a little bit more patient with the process. So, we'll be looking to clearly match fund our acquisition needs with dispositions and so, it'll be a different approach. This year, we stepped up and went ahead and made the decision to pull capital out of a number of assets that we felt like -- in markets that we didn't -- were not really long-term hold for us, but -- so what we're left with today, we're pretty comfortable with.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay, and a follow up on large and secondary markets. If I look at the revenue variants between large and secondary, it seems like it has been converging for the last few quarters. Would you say is that really a function of you exiting the 11 lower growth secondary markets or is there something else going on in those markets?
Eric Bolton: Well, I think it generally is a function of, as we continue to move further into the economic recovery, the secondary markets are starting to pick up a little bit more traction on employment growth. These secondary markets continue to not see the supply pressure volume that you see in the larger markets and so as you may see, if you will, a little moderation take place in some of the larger markets as a consequence of supply continuing to come into those markets. The secondary markets being a little later to show economic recovery and employment recovery are starting to get a little bit more traction on the demand side of the equation and still are not seeing the level of supply pressure that you see in some larger markets. So, it's playing out as we expect. I think as you get further into the cycle, you continue to see that performance delta begin to close a little bit. I think you actually have to get into a much more of a recessionary-type environment for the secondary markets to actually outperform. We've see that in the past. We saw that back in 2008, '09 and part of '10. I don't think we're headed back to that kind of an environment, but you never know and that's why they're there.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Buck Horne: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess, Eric, if you could go back to some of the comments you made about the study that you were talking about earlier -- very interesting trends and I'm just wondering, if you've got any data in the Mid-America portfolio that maybe supports some of the stats you're talking about? I mean, have you seen any changes this year in the median age of new tenants? Are you seeing a skew towards younger renters coming in or likewise have you seen any changes in the median income of your new tenants? Are you getting that higher credit quality renter coming in?
Thomas Grimes: Yeah.
Eric Bolton: This is Tom by the way.
Thomas Grimes: Yeah, sorry. Dial it down a second. Tom speaking. I think the Gen Y study by ULI reflected reality, not really a change. So, our rent income ratio has bounced between 17% and 18%, and that's been very good. Average income of $66,000. 50% of our residents are Gen Y and another 15% in that -- or another 20% of that, 35 to 44 group. So, what we're seeing is across all facets of our portfolio, large and small, our reality ties pretty close to what that ULI study shows demographically.
Eric Bolton: But, I will say that we are seeing income levels continue to move up in our portfolio, both as a consequence of improving employment market and frankly, as we continue to improve the quality of the portfolio that we see that happening, but after four or five years of pretty steady rent growth, our rent to income ratios are holding very consistent in that 17% to 18% range. So, by definition of course, incomes are going up at a level sufficient to keep that ratio in line. So, the point obviously in putting some of this information out is just to bring home the fact that we see a lot of appeal amongst this millennial generation for a lot of these suburban locations in the South-eastern markets, and it doesn't all have to be downtown.
Buck Horne: Great. Very helpful, and switching to kind of the financing market. It sounds like the GSEs have tightened up their belt at least through year end on funding some new projects that are out there till they can reset their allocations. I'm wondering if you've seen any changes in pricing from LICOs or pension money that's out there and just how does that balance -- fit with your balance sheet capability and is it possible that you might see some deals come through before year end that you guys can act on, it might give you some upside to the acquisition budget?
Albert Campbell: Well, I'll certainly give you on what we're seeing in the agencies and life insurance companies, Buck and consistent with what you're saying, they've both -- I think have hit their cap a couple of months ago and what we're seeing is a lot of deals that come that are really -- when they get across their desk, they're pushing for January -- January, February. So we definitely -- and yet the life companies are there, but I think given the open window there I don't think they're being aggressive in price to pick up volume. I think they're kind of holding their pricing standards when they're there, is what we're hearing. So, we would certainly expect that there would be potential opportunities. As you say, we still have what, another $100 million this year left to dive into our guidance for our acquisitions. So, we're hopeful that as you move close to year end with that year end point drawing clear, there'll be some people who for a portfolio reason or for some reason want a deal done by year end and our strategy is to have very low-cost and very flexible capital and we certainly have that with our credit facility, $750 million. We have plenty of capital. So, we can certainly take advantage and our leverage is as low as it's ever been. So, if that opportunity comes we're certainly ready to take advantage of that and we think that's possible going forward. I think that agencies we have heard to date, they still will have some commitment to the environment next year and feel good that that will continue to produce support for liquidity next year.
Buck Horne: Very helpful guys. Thank you.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Buck.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Zelman. Your line is now open.
Dan Oppenheim: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more in terms of the acquisitions here in terms of just looking for more through the end of the year. Is that something where you've some identified at this point or is that where there's a hope that there'll be some where there'll be some sellers with an urgent timeline in the last two months of the year here?
Eric Bolton: We've got one opportunity currently under contract that we're working through due diligence on right now that would get probably close to half of that opportunity should it close, but we typically just over the years have always seen in the last couple of months of the year. People get a little bit more interested about getting something done and we track a lot of deals over the course of the year that we pass on or that we feel like pricing has gotten away from us and often times those deals fall out of contract and then they circle back around and that typically happens the last couple of months of the year. So, we're going to be patient as I mentioned earlier, but we think it's conceivable that we'll get another deal or two done by year end.
Dan Oppenheim: Okay. Then in terms of the disposition environment, I think you did a great job earlier this year in terms of selling based on just the appetite from buyers out there and I heard your comments in terms of being happy and comfortable with the current market position. So, I guess, there's a difference between the content with the supply demand dynamics in a market versus the efficiency site and with some of the secondary markets where it's still pretty small in terms of the overall value there, how do you think about that in terms of the efficiency if this environment continues would you look to sell out of some more of those markets?
Eric Bolton: We feel like we're able to handle the operations of those secondary markets on a fairly efficient basis, because of course, recognize that they're all in the Southeast and so we can get to them all fairly easily, fairly quickly. We have divisional offices in Atlanta and in Jacksonville, in Nashville, in Dallas and in Charlotte, and so you know, it's pretty easy for our folks to stay connected and we don't think that we'd really give up a whole lot in efficiency and we gain a whole lot in diversification, value and benefit.
Dan Oppenheim: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Your line is now open.
Tom Lesnick: Good morning. My first question just has to do with the potential for a rising rate environment. Obviously, yesterday people on the Street read through the Fed announcement and the probability of a rate hike jumped up by year end, but some of your private competitors in the Southeast likely need a greater amount of leverage in order to execute deals, and therefore the logic is that cap rates in your markets might be more sensitive to the rate increase. I guess, what's your view on that and since you're the largest fish in the sea, so to speak, does that actually give you an increased competitive advantage for acquisitions?
Eric Bolton: Well, we do think that in a rising rate environment where cap rates get to move up a little bit and financing cost move up a little bit, we do probably net-net get more of a competitive advantage in that environment. I do think that we have seen a lot of fairly large institutional capitalists, institutional investors in most of these markets that we're in, in the Southeast and so these are folks who have clear execution capabilities and strong balance sheets, but as you point out, they are using the financing environment to their advantage right now. I do think that if we do see over the next couple years, that dynamic change a little bit that net-net probably creates more external growth opportunity for us.
Tom Lesnick: Thanks, and then on I saw your acquisition guidance was revised slightly lower at midpoint. Are we to read through on that and assume that maybe that's you guys just being a little bit more conservative at this point in the cycle or how should we be looking at your investment in external versus internal value creation opportunities going forward?
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean, I think the read through on that is just more of a function of what the external market is experiencing as opposed to any change in our part. We've always had a fairly disciplined approach to how we deploy capital. We've got some very defined protocols that we've used for over 20 years and in some market environments, it creates a little bit more of a challenge to find ways to put money to work on a basis that will meet those hurdles because the market's gotten a little bit frothy, which is the situation we find ourselves in right now. So there's no change from our perspective internally on anything that we're doing. It's just market conditions have created that. So that's the point. I'm sorry. What was the second part of your question?
Tom Lesnick: Just, I mean trying to get in that view, would we expect to see you perhaps increase your redevelopment program going forward and look for internal value creation opportunities?
Eric Bolton: Well, we certainly are working that angle of capital deployment as aggressively as we can. I think, Tom and his team are looking at something around 5,000 units this year. We probably will have something comparable to that next year. What we find is that, if we begin to accelerate that or push that in a more aggressive fashion, we typically start to run into a little more vacancy loss and a little bit lower return on the capital when we start to press that agenda much more aggressively. So, we're going to push it as hard as we can, but we're not going to push it a point we start to compromise returns and we think roughly around 5,000 units a year is about what we can handle without -- and keeping the returns very, very attractive.
Thomas Grimes: And keeping the test correct. I mean, it is very important to us to renovate. It's easy to do a renovate and think that you got it. It's is harder to do a renovate and know that you got the return. So, when we are doing a renovation, we do the redeveloped unit and release it right next to a non-redeveloped unit, and we measure the distance between the two so that we know we're getting a fair return on our capital. If you go too hard, you lose the ability to be disciplined about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.
Drew Babin: More of a top down question, many of your markets have benefited a lot from just not a lot of new supply deliveries, in kind of the 2010 to 2012 timeframe and elevated supply growth that we've seen in the last few years to really just kind of fill that void. Assuming demand kind of consistent with 15 levels going forward in '16, '17, '18, how much runway do you believe there is before the inflection point where supply kind of just causes some marginal deceleration in fundamentals and kind of what markets do you expect that to happen in quicker?
Eric Bolton: Drew, I've long believed that where you begin to see the dynamics and the chemistry if you will in the leasing environment materially change and it's really driven on the demand side of the equation. I think that the supply levels that we're seeing today as you point out in many cases are just in some cases, in some markets catching up, like certainly -- we've got a completely different sort of dynamic now with the millennial generation and the whole psychology, and in various stages in society to continue to create sort of an elevated level of demand at least for some time that we haven't experienced in the past. So, it's really hard to see any sort of material weakening taking place over the next couple of years. As a result, on the assumption that the economic environment and the job growth environment continues at its current pace, I think where you see things really change materially is all of a sudden we have a shock to the economy. We have a shock to a particular market. Take Houston as an example, where all of a sudden the demand dynamics change and you never frankly in many cases, never see it coming, and it catches everybody off-guard a little bit and then you still of course have the supply pipeline that's still coming online and you've got to kind of work your way through that and that's where you see material change in the leasing environment, material change in your ability to push pricing. So absent a tech meltdown in Atlanta or a [indiscernible] oil breakdown in Houston or some other sort of market specific kind of event that I could point to broadly speaking as long as the economy stays healthy we'll be okay, but if we have some sort of a crisis elsewhere in the world or something happens that causes the U.S. economy to all of a sudden nosedive, I think that, that could really change the equation quite a bit, because we'll still have the supply coming online and we'll have to deal with that, but we don't see that happening. Meanwhile, what we attempt to do is continue to build strength in the portfolio, continue to cycle capital, recycle capital, get it exactly positioned as we want, stay balanced, stay diversified, build balance sheet strength, so that when those things do happen and you see a material change in the environment we're first of all, okay and second of all in position to take advantage of it.
Drew Babin: Thanks for the insight. In your markets -- and I'll use Dallas as an example, a good deal of supply coming online this year and it's looking like next year as well is kind of concentrated in CBD sort of the same high end high rise type of product. In deliveries for maybe the second half of '16 and '17, are you starting to see developers' kind of target the suburbs a little more at the margin than they have been in the last couple of years?
Eric Bolton: I don't think there's any real evidence on that. I think that, we find that construction costs continue to create some pressure and I think that uniform across whether you're talking about more urban locations or suburban locations. I think that -- we've not seen any evidence to suggest that all a sudden now, suburban locations are going to be more exposed to overdevelopment. I think that we continue to see a lot of interest in developers focusing on some these infill locations. You may see a little bit more effort taking place at some of these sort of what I call inner loop areas where they can go in and areas being re-gentrified in some fashion in they go in and do some teardowns. We see some of this happening in north of downtown, Atlanta area as an example area [indiscernible] so but I don't think there's any evidence at this point that we can see, suggesting that suburbs all of a sudden are going to be the big focus for developers going forward.
Drew Babin: Thank you. Great quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes, good morning. Great quarter. I just started to look out a little bit further, 6 to 12 months, could you just talk a little bit about operating expenses and kind of what you think that's going to be going specifically if you think you're going to have another year like this with taxes where things missed out off pretty high and then everything started to moderate later on.
Eric Bolton: Well, I think, overall, let me start with that Tayo, we don't expect expenses as we move in the future, even in 2016 to be higher than they are today. I think we do continue to expect some pressure on the relative basis from taxes maybe a little less than we felt this year, except we were five this year and maybe we see that comedown but, overall it's still a third of our expenses and be higher than the growth rate of other expenses. So, I think across the board we expect next year to be not sharing expenses and under control.
Omotayo Okusanya: That's helpful. Then just in regards to particular markets. You did make some comments about Houston earlier on. In Atlanta, your same store revenue also kind of dropped over 100 basis points quarter over quarter and just curious if there's anything specific going on in that market.
Thomas Grimes: No, Atlanta is our strongest market. So, pricing momentum, there is good, results are good. I think if you look at the year-over-year comparison, second quarter to year-over-year in third quarter and give us a little bit of an odd story because the cop was much tougher in third quarter than it was in second quarter, but pricing momentum very strong in Atlanta and we're excited to be there and excited that it's a large market for us.
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Haendel St. Juste: Can you guys provide a bit more color on the two assets acquired, the two leased up assets during third quarter? Perhaps some thoughts on stabilized yields and underwritten IRRs and then, what was the rationale for buying assets in Kansas City where you own just, I think two assets in Newport News or Virginia Beach, where you also own just a few assets. It seems a bit out of line with your goal of trying to rationalize some of your non-core market exposure. So is this you're signalling your intent to build some scale in these markets and now you consider this to be core markets for you or maybe more a reflection of the challenges of investing in some of your larger markets?
Eric Bolton: I think that both acquisitions are exactly in line with what our strategy is that we outlined. We've long said that Kansas City being a secondary market, we think fits very well within sort of the dynamic we're trying to create for the secondary market segment of the portfolio and so we've been active in that market looking for opportunities, being patient as we look for opportunities and the property that we acquired in Overland Park is, we acquired it at something around 5.2, 5.3 cap rate, in a stabilized yield around 5.7, 5.8. So we feel very good about that investment and it continues to add to what we expect to be a growing presence in Kansas City. The acquisition in Virginia Beach, we've got several properties in that area. Again, it's a different dynamics as far as that area is concerned. A lot more government based employment, but we've made an effort to expand our footprint in that area. Fredericksburg is an area we've focused on. Charlottesville, Newport News, Hampton. We've got a fair amount of presence in that area and we plan to continue to stay active in that market as well and likewise again, that was property that we had been tracking for a couple of years. We acquired it at more around a 5.5 cap, closer to 5, again 5.8, 5.9 in yield somewhere in that range and it's a brand-new asset. So, we think it'll be a good long-term investment for us.
Haendel St. Juste: I appreciate that and then one more, if I may, a quick one on capital location. So you allocated some of your disposition proceeds towards paying down debt this quarter as opposed to buying assets, and now you're about 5.75 at EBITDA down from about 6 last quarter. So maybe you can share with us an update on your leverage goals today and where you want your leverage to be over the course of the next year, two years in terms of debt to EBITDA, and then as part of these capital allocation and/or balance sheet management goals, how does stock buybacks play?
Albert Campbell: Haendel, this is Al. I'll answer the first part. I think in general, our leverage goals really haven't changed. We've long been in the 40% to 42% debt to gross assets as the right leverage level, given our strategy with the lower risk, minimal development high-quality cash flow diversified markets. That make sense for our Company. We're below in that right now, not so much focused on that as much as being patient on the acquisition side. We recycle capital. We haven't yet -- we're a net seller to the tune of about 110 million right now and so we're being patient with that, but we're comfortable with 40% to 42% range. I think over time, as we move forward you'll probably see us stay closer to the lower end of that range particularly as we continue to build and maintain balance sheet strength to have opportunity for the future when things change in a year or two. When, we don't know, but things certainly do at some point. We want balance sheet strength to take care of that. So, our strategy really hasn't changed and we feel like it's strong. We do think that the debt to EBITDA, we do expect it to stay below 6. I think it's an important mark. So, that was good to see.
Eric Bolton: And Haendel, on the share buyback, it's something we've done in the past. We obviously understand the approach. We understand the logic behind it. It's something we continue to monitor and keep an eye on. We, at this point, we feel like we can create better returns long-term with being patient with the capital that we have, deleveraging a little bit, building capacity for what we think will be better buying opportunities in the future and looking for the opportunities and scratching a corner for a few opportunities that we have gotten this year and those are going to be good returns on capital, we believe, but should the market turn particularly negative for some reason and we find ourselves trading at persistent meaningful discounted value, we certainly understand the logic behind using capital to reinvest in existing portfolio through share buyback and we'll continue to monitor it.
Haendel St. Juste: Remind me again, do you have a current authorization in place and if so what's the capacity?
Eric Bolton: There is one there. It's been some time ago. We visit with our Board on this periodically, but we do have a plan that's been there for some years. We'll probably be updating that at some point later this year.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to our speakers for any closing remarks.
Eric Bolton: No closing remarks. So thanks everybody for joining us and we'll see a lot of you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect. Thank you and have a great day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating in the MAA Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, we would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin.
Timothy Argo: Thank you, Erika. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 1934 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. When we reach the question-and-answer portion of the call, I would ask for everyone to please limit their questions to no more than two in order to give everyone ample opportunity to participate. Should you have additional questions, please re-renter the queue or you're certainly welcome to follow-up with us after we conclude the call. Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. MAA posted strong second quarter results with same store NOI increasing 7.5% over the prior year, generating core FFO per share of a $1.36 which is a record performance for the company. I’ll tribute the strong results to three factors. First, the demand for apartment housing is strong across our high growth region. The steady improvement and employment conditions coupled with the surge and new renter household formations are more than offsetting to higher levels of new supply. We feel that our approach is diversifying capital across a number of markets in the high growth Sunbelt region coupled with also diversifying the portfolio across suburban inner loop and a growing number of more urban locations provides a more balanced platform that is better positioned for deflecting new supply pressure. This is worth noting that the 5.3% revenue growth captured this quarter from our secondary market segment of the portfolio, is the strongest performance we’ve seen since of third quarter of 2011 and we’re encouraged with the trends that we’re seeing. Secondly, our strong Q2 performance reflects various opportunities and synergies harvested from our merger with Colonial Properties. The 60 basis point improvement in same store NOI margin reflects improvements in revenue management practices and unit turn efficiencies within the legacy Colonial portfolio as well as a number of opportunities driven by the largest scale of the company. As we’ve noted for the last couple of quarters, now that we’ve completed a full year harvesting merger related operating benefits and while there are still some additional opportunities left to squeeze, there will be some year-over-year moderation for merger lift taking place over the back half of this year. However, it’s important to note as outlined in our earnings guidance, we certainly expect to sustain the merger benefits that had been captured to date and retained a momentum in both improved occupancy levels and pricing trends that have been achieved. And thirdly, our strong Q2 results and positive momentum reflect the growing benefits of these significant capital recycling that we’ve accomplished over the past few years. It is worth noting that MAA’s same store NOI margin after routine capital spending has improved 570 basis points over the past five years. As we steadily recycle capital from some of our older investments and to newer and higher cash flow margin properties, which has also resulted in recycling capital into markets providing better long-term growth prospects and opportunity for enhanced operating efficiency. We’ve made a meaningful improvement in the cash flow growth prospects of our same store portfolio. So balance, it was a good quarter. But more importantly the trends that drove the great results are variables that we expect to hold on to and further improve. On the transaction front, our activities so far this year clearly reflects the environment that favors harvesting value from non-core investments while requiring a lot of patience and discipline on the capital redeployment side of the equation. The pricing achieved on our planned asset sales for the year exceeded our expectations and resulted in strong investment returns for shareholder capital. During the second quarter we initiated two new development projects in Orlando and in Charleston which are highly accretive expansions of existing communities. We closed our two new acquisitions located in Scottsdale and Richmond. The transaction market continues to be very active and we’re underwriting quite a few deals. However, our client properties on a basis that meet our investment hurdles remains a challenge. We continue to see some pretty aggressive pricing paid on both stabilized and pre-stabilized properties with new development opportunities also reclaim increasingly optimistic or aggressive assumptions. Accordingly, as noted in our updated guidance, we’ve lowered our anticipated acquisition fine for this year. I continue to believe that we’ll see some increasing opportunities for redeploying capital on an attractive basis as we’ve moved later into the cycle. Meanwhile, we will continue to stick to our disciplines and actively work to market looking for the unique opportunities that set our parameters. In summary, we like where the portfolios now positioned and believe that we are well balanced to take advantage of the favorable leasing conditions across our high growth region. The operating platform is strong, more efficient and are propping to asset management team is performing at a high level. Our redevelopment program continues to deliver strong value growth, and a pipeline with new development and leased up properties will generate attractive new growth in 2016. The balance sheets in a strong position and we’re excited about what I believe will be increasing opportunities to capture new growth as we work into 2016. That’s all I have in the way of comments, and I’ll turn the call over to Tom for update on operating as well.
Thomas Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. Our record results were driven by an increase in revenue per occupied unit of 5.3% up to a $1,100 and a 100 basis point increase in average physical occupancy. July trends continue to be steady. Our 60-day exposure which is current vacant, plus all notices for a 60-day period is just 7.1%, down a 130 basis points from the same time last year. July blended rents on a lease-over-lease basis from 5.6% or 20 basis points better than the same time last year. The great results for the quarter did pressure our personnel expenses is more of our property teams are on track to meet their performance based compensation targets. Personnel costs less [indiscernible] were up just 3.7%. Property taxes also pressured expenses up 7% as municipalities particularly in Texas were aggressive in their valuations. The benefits of our strong operating platform on the legacy Colonial communities continues to pay dividends. The more robust approach of our revenue management practices has allowed the Colonial communities to capture rent growth of more than a 180 basis points above their market peers. Our long-term focus on average [indiscernible] to this group plus the portfolio average down 20% for the quarter and to 22.8 days for the month of June. On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results. In this group 11 of our 13 markets had at least 6% revenue growth. Large market leaders included Atlanta, Orlando, Austin and Raleigh. The secondary markets which have lower supply pressure achieved 5.3% revenue growth. In these markets we also benefited from improved job growth, the Colonial operating improvements as well as the advantage of a robust re-operating platform in markets that don’t see many recap our platform. Notably secondary market performance included Charleston, Savannah, Granville and Jacksonville. Turnover for the same store portfolio was again down for the quarter by 2.4%, on a 12 month rolling basis, it’s a low 53.6%. Move outs to home buying were just a 19.5% well below the historic norms and move outs to home rentals were down 14.5% and represent less than 8% of total move outs. Year-to-date we’ve completed 2,400 redevelopment units, 1,400 on the legacy Colonial communities. We’re on pace to renovate 4,000 units again this year and expect the mix to continue to favor the Colonial portfolio. As a reminder, on average we spent approximately $4,300 per unit and receive a $95 rent increase over a comparable non-renovated unit which generates a year-one cash return of over 20%. As mentioned on our last call, we mentioned to you that we ranked as the number one REIT and online customer service reputation by J Turner Research. During the second quarter the same organization rated the top 50 operators and multi-family units in United States. We earned a number one rating in that group as well. The focus on the customers not a new idea at MAA, this is a result of our sophisticated customer service approach as well as our long-term cultural focus on creating a home for our residents rather than just a place to live. We feel the results speak volumes about our team’s ability to create value for our customers which is one of the key drivers of our ability to deliver steady long-term performance for our shareholders. Al?
Albert Campbell: Okay, thank you Tom, and good morning, everyone. Off about some additional commentary on the company’s second quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and on our rise got us for the full year. FFO for the second quarter was $112.4 million or $1.41 per share, and core FFO which excludes certain non-cash and non-routine items was $118 million or $1.36 per shares, that’s compared to $93.9 million or $1.18 per share for the prior year, which is $0.07 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance and represents a 15% growth over the prior year. Recurring capital expenditures for the quarter were $21.9 million or $0.28 per share, which produced core AFFO for the second quarter $86.1 million or $1.8 per share compared to quarterly dividend of $0.77 per share which is strong coverage. As Tom discussed, we were pleased with the strong operating performance for the quarter which produced the majority of the favorability to our forecast as pricing, occupancy levels and fee income are above our quarterly projects. During the second quarter we acquired two new communities for a combined purchase price of $111.3 million, bringing our total acquisition investment for the full year today to approximately $158 million for three new properties. During the second quarter we also sold 14 of our communities for growth proceeds of $180 million and recorded book gains of about $105 million. Immediately following the end of the quarter with closing [Audio Gap] traditional of our communities. For gross communities of $121 million and expect to record additional book gains approximately $54 million during the third quarter. These sales complete our full year disposition plans with 21 properties averaging 25 years of age being sold for $354.3 million, representing a 5.8% economic cap rate based on last 12 months NOI with a 4% management fee and actual CapEx. And notably this cap rate is only 30 basis points above the expected stabilize cap rate on the three new properties acquired thus far this year. We also continue to make progress on our development plans during the quarter. We completed the construction of an expansion of a community located in Nashville and as Eric mentioned, we began construction on two additional expansion opportunities in Charleston and in Orlando. The total construction costs for these four communities currently under development as expected to be about $119 million of which only $64 million remains to funded at quarter end. We have three communities totaling 799 units currently in lease-up with average occupancy of 76.6% at quarter end and we expect all three of these communities to be stabilized by the first quarter of 2016. At the end of the second quarter, our balance sheet remain in great shape. Our total debt to market cap was 37%, our fixed coverage ratio was over four times and our net debt to recur EBITDA declined to six times. Over 70% of our assets are encumber and over 92% of fixed or heads against rising interest rates. We have about 300 main of debt maturing later this year, primarily in the fourth quarter which we currently expect to refinance with unsecured senior nodes. And anticipation with this financing, we have pretty large interest rate on about a $100 million of these maturities using forward interest rate swaps. We expect proceeds from acquisition – asset sales, excuse me, with the additional $80 million to $85 million of internal free cash flow produced this year to fully fund our acquisition and development needs. Our current plan do not occurred [indiscernible] this year, at quarter end, we had over $360 million of total cash and credit available under our line of credit supporting our liquidity, and we expect in the year with our leveraged and it’s net debt to gross assets between 41% and 42%, below the 42.6% recorded at the end of 2014. And finally, due to strong operating performance and capture of the benefits from the Colonial merger of the first half of the year, we are raising our guidance for core FFO and AFFO for the full year. We’re now projecting core FFO for the full year to be $5.25 to $5.41 per share or $5.33 from midpoint, representing a 6.8% growth over the prior year. Core AFFO is now projected to be $4.60 to $4.76 per share or $4.68 at the midpoint representing a 9.3% growth from the prior year. And notably, the expected AFFO growth rate is 250 basis points higher than FFO growth rate and will begin to see the asset recycling and program impact of our capital spending for the year. Same store NOI is now projected to be a 4.5% to 5.5% for the year, based on revenue growth with 4.5% to 5.5% and expense growth of 4% to 5%. So that’s all we have in the way for prepared comments. So Eric, we’ll take the call back to you for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go first to side of Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.
Austin Wurschmidt: Hey good morning. Just touching on the guidance little bit, with the – you guys have walked in 5.7% growth year-to-date and where are you standing in terms of versus the full year the 4.5% to 5.5%, you’re tracking ahead of that and I know that comps get more difficult in the back half of the year but with occupancy in the high 96% range and the blended rate growth of 5.6%, I mean is there something that you’re seeing in July or further out that is concerning or that you think that there could be some significant deceleration in the second half of the year?
Albert Campbell: Austin, this is Al, I’ll take the first part of that per share, and the poor thing here is to know what are guidance is, we’re actually not projecting a deceleration in the back half of the year. And what you’ll see as you looked to the numbers are really, we’re projecting strong pricing performance, continued to stabile occupancy at last year’s level which was very high call it 95%, 96% range. And then really just hitting the impact of the tougher comps, from the first half and back half of last year, and so that’s really what’s underscoring the guidance. And then matter of fact, do the math you’ll look at pricing at 4% to 5% - 4.5% for the back half.
Austin Wurschmidt: What do you guys sending out in terms of renewal offers? And where is occupancy as of the end of July?
Thomas Grimes: So, it’s Tom, Austin. The average physical occupancy through July is 96.3% and for August we got 6% except and September 5.2%, October is a little too early to talk about at this point.
Albert Campbell: And I would just add just systematically here, the point is, is that the moment that we’re seeing we expect that to continue. We don’t anticipate any sort of deceleration taking place. The tougher comps is solely the issue here that would suggest or implied some weaker performance if you will over the back half of the year, on a year-over-year basis only. I mean the strong trends that we’re seeing we certainly expect those to continue and as Tom just pointed out, occupancy remains very strong, turnover remains very low and your rent growth is very much in line with what we’ve been seeing, is just that the back half of last year’s win, the lift really began to be harvested out of our merger and so the comps just get little tougher. And that’s all that took play here.
Thomas Grimes: And primarily in occupancy and fee marginal lifts.
Austin Wurschmidt: Okay. And then second question, just vis-a-via your comments about development underwriting becoming a bit more difficult. How comfortable are you guys with ground up development today and is it something that you’re considering beyond the two expansion opportunities that you announced this quarter?
Eric Bolton: We continued to talk to numbers of developers as I think, I mean we’re not really a development company ourselves. So our approach has always been to find arrangements, partnerships if you will where we could work with the developer to bring out a ground an opportunity that we’ve feel like would make sense for us. We’re looking at lot of deals right now but I would just tell you that with most of the deals that we’ve been seeing the lease-up assumptions that we feel comfortable that underwriting to given other supply that we see coming into the market is not creating the kind of returns on cap where that we feel good with right now. So, it’s tough to make those numbers to work as it is to make deals – make sense for us right now on the buy side. Typically where we’re finding our best opportunities as represented in the three deals that we’ve done thus far this year are situations where the properties are in some state of lease-up. And it maybe a local developer, regional developer that is anxious to put capital out and get going on another project or there is some sort of financing pressure that’s building. And that’s typically where we’re finding our best buying opportunities right now, best deployment opportunities as deals that are in lease-up. We’re talking and we’ll continue to look at development deals but we’re being pretty cautious about it right now.
Austin Wurschmidt: So in terms of you starting or commencing a ground up development that’s unlikely, you’re more focused on looking at potential acquisition opportunities that are in lease-up.
Eric Bolton: That’s we’re finding our best opportunity, I would tell you that we may find an opportunity for ground up development later this year. We’re looking at several – I’m not sure I would say it’s unlikely, but I would say it’s going to be – there is a challenge to it. The deals we’ve looked at thus far have not comment without force.
Austin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks for the time.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from the side of Gaurav Mehta from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Gaurav Mehta: Hi, good morning. Eric, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about strong operating trends further improved. Can you elaborate on that, is that – does that mean that you expect the quarter growth trajectory to continue for the next couple of years or just more color on that?
Eric Bolton: Well, I think that the further improvement comment was really applied to really all three aspects of sort of the factors that I felt like really propelled our performance this quarter. I mean we still see some more lift that we think will squeeze out of our merger with Colonial, particularly in the redevelopment or rehab effort on unit interior renovation, much of our focus now is on the Colonial portfolio, legacy Colonial portfolio for that effort. We continue to see some opportunity with renters insurance and some other things that fee programs that we’re rolling out. Certainly the market fundamentals broadly continue to suggest that we’re actually going to – if you look at sort of job growth to supply projections, most markets that we’re looking at look to be stronger next year as compared to this year. And we think that as we continue to harvest the opportunity or the redeployment of capital this year in some of these lease-up deals that we’re going to continue to see a boost in next year’s performance from those deals as well. So, there is a number of things that all suggest to us that further improvement is likely in the card for us.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay. And my second question is on commercial and land sales, it seems like you guys reduced the guidance for 2015. Can you comment on that?
Eric Bolton: Yeah, we had one retail asset that it was a legacy Colonial property that fell out of contract in the second quarter, and we’ve juts opted to sort of pull back on that deal at this point. And we’ve got some things that we’re working on at the property, so we think stabilize it, enhance value and we may look it bringing that back to market at some point in the future, but we just decided when the deal fell out to just pull back on it and that’s really all that’s happened. There is just one asset is what we’re talking about, so it’s a fairly insignificant part of the balance sheet overall.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay, thanks for taking my questions.
Eric Bolton: You bet.
Operator: We’ll go next to the side of Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please go ahead.
Robert Stevenson: Good morning, guys.
Eric Bolton: Hey Rob.
Robert Stevenson: Eric, I mean given the success in pricing on the year-to-date dispositions, what – and these – I had conversation with the board about it putting another $100 million, $200 million of the bottom to your assets out for sale and monetizing them today?
Eric Bolton: Yeah Rob, it is, I mean it’s something we talked about a lot. I would tell you, I mean we feel pretty good about where we have the portfolio at this point, I mean it’s important to recognize that over the last five years we’ve sold almost 50 properties of our 13,000 apartments. We have made a massive amount of sort of repositioning of the portfolio over the last five years and of course, this was a big year for us. And with the sales that had been consummated this year we really like where we’ve got the portfolio, so we don’t feel any pressure if you will to accelerate or do anything other than as we move forward now. And we’re perfectly content to – continue to own and operate the existing portfolio for some time. Having said that, we’re always going to be looking at opportunities to cycle capital and continue to improve the growth profile, the company or the portfolio. But we’re at a point now where I feel like that sort of matched funding the dispositions with redeployment opportunity is something we’re little bit more sensitive to right now. We don’t feel – we sort of discounted that worry a little bit over the past couple of years in an effort to just harvest the opportunity to cycle it out at pretty good pricing in this very low interest rate and low cap rate environment. And so we feel pretty good with what we’ve got right now, we’re going to be a little bit more focused on looking at match funding going funding, of course, it’s tough to put money out right now. So we’re going to, as opportunities and the market comes our way from an acquisition’s perspective that may create an opportunity to recycle little bit more later this year and to next year but we’re pretty set with where we are right now.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then question for Tom, I mean Houston, I mean people [Audio Gap] worried about falling energy prices and all of the supply that’s coming online in that market and been looking for the cracks and the fall. I mean is it – when I look at your results I know they’re pretty good, I don’t know with Houston, I mean is it high on the expense side but revenue seems to be doing decently. Is there anything that you’re seeing in that market that’s causing you any concern as you think about the back half of this year and into 2016?
Thomas Grimes: I mean, I agree with what you said there Rob, and sometimes the performance of a market on sort of rent growth especially at 06/06 is [indiscernible] looking because it’s reflective of the re-pricing that we’ve done over the past year or so. It is something that we’re monitoring, it’s 3% of our portfolio but turnover for the quarter there was down. What I would tell you is, we expect to maintain occupancy levels around 95% but expect rents to soften a bit. New rents are already flat there and renewal acceptances are coming back in the 3.5% range. So, given the slowdown in jobs and the steady supply there that’s how on our list of worrying markets.
Eric Bolton: I would tell you Rob, I mean I think to suggest that there is not, I mean there is going to be moderation in Houston there is just no question. I think we see it coming and we’re going to continue to watch it but as Tom mentioned, it’s only 3% of our NOI so it’s not a big worry beat for us per se but that’s the market that I think you’ve got to see softness, more softness over the next several quarters.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And specifically on the expense side there, would that just property taxes when you’re looking at the year-to-date numbers?
Albert Campbell: Right, that’s absolutely right. I mean all those taxes came out aggressive as we kind of alluded to in our press release. Houston unbelievably was one of the most aggressive and the poor thing there is, you fight of all these, Houston we’re not done fighting, it’s some of the other places we’ve completed, we’ve kind of gotten some of the winds and know we’re going to lose. Houston, we still have some to go, it is high right and hopefully we’ll work on that but that’s the point for expenses.
Robert Stevenson: All right, thanks guys.
Eric Bolton: Thank you, Rob.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from the side of Omotayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
George Notter: Yeah hey guys. This is actually George on for Omotayo. Just wondering if you can just comment on the acquisition environmental, so in terms of the buyers that are out there, is there any change in the financing environment for the buyers of some of the properties in the treasury markets?
Eric Bolton: No, I don’t think there is any real change other than potentially just capital willing to take a little lower rate of return. I mean the financing environment is very strong, these are institutional buyers that are involved in acquiring these assets that we’ve sold. Agency financing being used in all cases and then looking at deals that we’ve been chasing in the market place that have gone to someone else. Again, these are all institutional buyers, in many cases again using agency financing. So I would tell you there has been no real change per se other than just I feel like that there is probably a little bit more aggressive of underwriting taking place today versus a year ago. And I think at some level those probably are returns on capital that are trending lower and people are willing to accept that today versus where they were a year ago.
George Notter: Okay. And then just on development front in what you guys are sort of hearing in your markets, is there assume it can change in development costs and is it harder for people to get labor to do builds?
Eric Bolton: Well, from the developers that we talk to, yes. We hear that land cost and labor cost continue to be a challenge and I think that it is hopefully going to create some level of discipline in terms of the amount of supply that ultimately will be brought to market because the deals are just getting a little bit harder to pencil out. What we’re finding is that the yields and the margins in these deals are starting to go down a little bit, someone willing to be a lot more aggressive on the lease-up assumptions and the pricing assumptions because the cost have gone up. And so people would just getting increasingly aggressive on lease-up and pricing and with supply coming into number of these markets, depending on the submarket situation some of the underwriting that would be required to make the numbers work, or things that we just didn’t get comfortable with and backed away from most of the deals that we’ve been looking at.
Thomas Grimes: And to support Eric’s comments just a little, in 2015 in our markets we expect 94,700 units to be delivered. In 2016 we expect 95,500 units to be delivered, so where it’s flattening out with that.
George Notter: All right, thanks guys.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, George.
Operator: We’ll go next to the side of Greg [indiscernible] with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, how are you doing?
Eric Bolton: Hey, Greg.
Unidentified Analyst: So my first one is, how much of your acquisition volume in the range of the year do you think will be stabilized versus the recently delivered on a stabilized stuff you’re talking about, where you see the best opportunity? And then what are the return hurdles and underwriting assumptions you’ve used when you underrate the un-stabilized comp product?
Eric Bolton: Well, I would tell you overwhelmingly we would expect the acquisitions to be non-stabilized deals, that’s where to find the best opportunity. And I have no reason to believe at this point that, I mean we’re looking at several other deals right now that are all either non-stabilized or just approaching it stabilize. So it’s – I think that overwhelming is still going to be that. And the assumptions of course vary quite a bit by market, I mean what we underwrote in Scottsdale, Arizona is going to be a lot different than what we assume to Richmond, Virginia but it’s going to vary quite a bit. But in terms of return requirements, I mean we typically are looking for deals that are going to create stabilized yields, NOI yields approaching six, returns on capital, 10 are better is generally what we’re looking at. And it’s hard to find the deals out there that meet those criteria right now but, what where we’re finding it is again in these non-stabilized deals or in the case of as an example to the properties that we’ve acquired this year in every single case they were under contract previously and they came back to us. And so that’s my comment about requiring a lot of patience right now, that’s where it takes.
Albert Campbell: And just to add in the forecasting, we’ve – our acquisition assumptions for the rest year pretty low for the backend of the year. So if we’re not able to close those deals of share, really it won’t have a big impact in the forecast, maybe half a penny or so more 2016 will be the fall.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then I mean you guys have talked obviously in your prepared remarks about how strong the momentum is, fundamentals are great. So as the years progressed, have you guys become willing at all the lower the cap rate hurdles or the return profiles you’re looking for to get acquisitions done given that things are fundamentally so strong and looks like the cycle may or less or longer than people’s thought?
Eric Bolton: No, the answer is no.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Eric Bolton: Our cost to capital in our share price is a big part of that obviously, so no, we’re not lowering our return [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: All right, that’s good to hear. And then just one more follow-up, in the event that you can’t get all the acquisitions done you’re hoping to back half of the year would you considering doing a stock buyback instead?
Eric Bolton: It depends on where our share price is. I mean every time we get ready to deploy capital out we have to ask ourselves is this the best use for that money. And if instead of acquiring an existing lease-up or something could be built and looking at that as an investment alternative versus buying our own portfolio, what sort of return expectations do we have out of our existing portfolio. So it’s – we’ve done share buyback in the past, we know what we understand the concept, we have a program in place and something we look at all the time.
Unidentified Analyst: All right, great. Thanks guys.
Eric Bolton: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to the side of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Kim: Thank you. I was going to ask if you can venture an estimate that you could share with us on what you think the value of your portfolio is on a per unit basis. This is all mid context of your acquiring at a 180,000 per unit, developing at a 147,000 per unit, selling at 69,000 per unit but these are all relatively small compared to your overall portfolio?
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean we don’t publish an NAV. I would tell you that at $77, $78 a share I don’t know where we are today right now, but it’s $77, $78 a share that’s based on our math that’s an imply cap rate of around 5.8%, 5.9% economic cap rate. And considering that we just sold 21 properties 25 years of age in treasury markets at an economic cap rate of 5.8%, I mean clearly we think there is some upsides there. And so in terms of the per unit cost that works out to right now at about or around a 110,000, 115,000 units somewhere in that range in terms of the implied price per unit.
John Kim: And what you’re seeing in the market is I would mention higher than that?
Eric Bolton: Oh yeah, absolutely.
John Kim: Okay. Also wanted to ask for just some clarification on the increase in same store expenses for the year. I can understand same store revenue increasing because the rents are going up but the same store expenses seems like a pretty big increase, realizing a part of that is tax driven but what are the other components of that higher?
Albert Campbell: John, this is Al, I’ll give you color on that. Taxes are biggest piece of that for sure as the line of share, I mean you got remember it’s over third of our expenses. And so we’ve talked about that a little bit pressure from Texas and Florida, it was little more than we have thought going into the year, so we raise our guidance there for 100 basis points or real estate taxes. I think the other largest piece is really personnel and that’s really we had a very good performance in the first half of the year, and certainly [indiscernible] paying our folks for the very good performance. But those are two biggest things and without personnel I think – without the incentive cost to personnel…
Eric Bolton: 3.7.
Albert Campbell: 3.7, so it’s not a significant pressure for me other than the good news that we’ve had. So those are two primary items.
John Kim: What about repair and maintenance, are you expensing some more given the [indiscernible]?
Eric Bolton: I mean at our NIM we had 1% tick-up and moves-ins and that changed a little bit but our cost per move is still basically the same.
Albert Campbell: The other areas are pretty much a normalized growth rate.
Eric Bolton: 2% to 3% on everything else, it’s really real estate taxes, it’s the big issue and incentive compensation but we’re getting that more than paid back on the top line. So from a margin perspective where the pressure is, is taxes.
John Kim: Okay, thank you.
Albert Campbell: Okay, thanks John.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from the side of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Richard Anderson: Thanks, good morning. So, on the guidance, how much of the increase to 2015 was basically just a roll forward of the outperformance in the second quarter and how much if any, did you adjust third and fourth quarter because of the performance – the outperformance in the second quarter?
Albert Campbell: Well, Rich, this is Al, I’ll just give you the highlights of that. We obviously raised guidance $0.12, $0.07 comes from the second quarter so we added five to the back half of the year from our previous guidance, I think three in the third quarter, two in the fourth quarter. And so there we certainly, some of that was carry forward of that momentum, I mean it’s underwritten as we said, we’ve had strong pricing, that strong pricing will continue, will be 4% to 4.5% through the back half year and occupancy very stable, basically flat, the last year it was very high. If you remember, if you go back a year we really started capturing strong occupancy in the back half of last year, so our compassions on that will be a little more challenging, we’ll have that marginal lift but those are the drivers of that forecast in that increase.
Richard Anderson: Okay. So, I mean my logic is, if you beat by – increase by $0.12, $0.07 in the second quarter and you added $0.03 to the third quarter then you should be able to beat by $0.04 when reported three months from now, right?
Albert Campbell: Well I’ll tell you, let me [indiscernible] the overall arching point I think is really one of the take years, we’re certainly not saying the back half is going to decelerate it anyway. But one of the big thing to understand about the performance in the first half of this year, if we really got strong performance on a marginal lift from occupancy and fees from the Colonial portfolio really rung out the synergies there. So that was a part of the first half performance that really – we’ll hold that gain, we’ll hold that water level in the tank but we certainly will have a tougher year-over-year comp going forward to think about it in the projections.
Eric Bolton: Rich, I mean we feel good about the back half of the year forecast and the $0.05 that’s implied lift and the improvement in our original forecast. But we still got – the Q3 is a big quarter, I mean we still got a lot of leasing to do, there is still some more tax bills to come in and we don’t really have good clarity on yet. So, there is still some wildcards out there but we feel good about the forecast we got.
Richard Anderson: Okay. And my second question is, having sold $350 million of assets, is there any kind of sense of obligation I guess to almost have to redeploy that capital. You kind of put yourself in a position where you had to and in the midst of a very competitive market and new supply coming in. And I guess that my question is, has it crossed your mind at all to just lot – really significantly reduce your acquisition activity, and maybe even consider a special dividend if you had to.
Thomas Grimes: Well, I will say this Rich. The one thing we won’t do is just put money out because we need to put money out. And if every single deal that we take a look at, we’ve edit it pretty thoroughly, we discuss it pretty actively with our board of directors and we’re very disciplined on every dollar we put out. And it very well maybe that we won’t buy anything else this year, I don’t think that’s the case, and I’m optimistic given the volume of opportunities that we’re looking at that in fact we will do some more acquisitions but it’s hard, no question about it. Having said that, if we wind up at the end of the year not putting any more capital out and we just wind up strengthening the balance sheet and getting ready for what I believe is going to be some great buying opportunities later this year and into 2016. We’re perfectly content to have that happen. We think we’ll be able to avoid any kind of special dividend requirement this year but we’ve got enough sort of 1031 shield opportunities to cover that this year. But there is certainly no pressure that we are feeling at all to just put the money out because we sold all these assets, and we’ll see what the future holds.
Richard Anderson: So, why you think there’ll be better opportunities in 2016 to acquire versus now?
Thomas Grimes: Because there is got to be more product coming in, more new product coming into the market place, more lease-up stress is the consequence of that. We likely are going to be looking at higher interest rates, we’re going to be looking at developers and capital probably more interest than they’re not. I mean as you know, a lot of these development deals that take place in the Southeast, the ones that we bought this year are all kind of smaller regional, developers, players they don’t build these things with the intent of owning them for very long. And they’re all about getting in and getting out. And I think getting – as volume picks up, interest rates pick up I think the getting out becomes a little bit – people get a little bit more nervous about it. And so I just think that, we’ve been through this – I’ve been here for 21 years, we’ve been to periods of time where putting money out is hard. And we’ve always stuck to our discipline during those periods, we’ve never put it out and we’ve always then win and it’s always cycle through that we’ve been running to some great buying opportunities, and I feel that that’s exactly what’s going to happen here.
Richard Anderson: Got you. Thank you.
Albert Campbell: Thanks, Rich.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from the side of Dan Oppenheim from Zelman & Associates.
Dan Oppenheim: Thanks very much. Just staying on those acquisitions for a second, with both West Creek and Skysong buying those near 80% occupancy and there is still some lease-up to do but now tremendous amount given your comment in terms of potentially more supply coming from lease-up strips next year but also your generally bullish outlook in terms of the demand environment. Would you look to potentially get better stabilized yields and buying assets over the coming time if they were below 80%, maybe if you look at Skysong with the innovation center there, should see pretty strong demand there at Scottsdale, what would you think?
Eric Bolton: Yeah, I think that if you get into opportunities where the project is either just coming out of the ground and leasing has just started, usually our yield opportunities are better, are higher. And so I think that we very well may find situations later this year and next year where the yield opportunities actually going to be better than what we’ve done so far this year. It’s hard to say but I think that there is reason to believe that that’s likely to be the case.
Dan Oppenheim: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: And we’ll take our question from the side of [indiscernible] from Green Sheet. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning.
Eric Bolton: Good morning, [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: So you mentioned earlier Eric in your opening comments the desire to be a little bit more inner loop and more urban. Will that – is that something that you’re going to look for in your acquisitions or it’ll be more acquiring when it comes to market?
Eric Bolton: Well, to a large degree it’s more acquiring what comes to market, it just happens that that’s where a lot of the opportunity is, that’s where as you know, a lot of the development has been going on and I think that’s where some of the greatest stress is likely to be over the next couple of years. And just as a consequence of being opportunistic in our buying we think that we likely will see more opportunities in the inner loop or urban areas. And we’re – we would like to see some of that happen and get a little bit more balance in the portfolio. At the end of the day, what we’re really – as I said in my earlier comments, we’re really all about trying to have a very balance portfolio of investments in an effort to sort of whether all various points of the cycle. And I think that obviously we’ve had a heavier weight towards more suburban locations historically, but if you look at some of the deal – really over the last three or four years much increasingly much more of a product has been were urban oriented, inner loop oriented. And I think that that’s where we’re going to continue to see more opportunity.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you. And then given the success that you highlighted with the Colonial portfolio and getting the synergies and the revenue management, how do you think about future portfolio opportunities?
Eric Bolton: We would be interested in those opportunities if they make sense for us. I mean we talked to lot of folks and we do look at opportunities from time-to-time and historically lot of things we’ve looked at is not either been product quality or the market mix that would make sense for us but we certainly are – we’ve learned a lot through this process that we went through the last two and a half years or so and we feel very comfortable and confident executing on another portfolio transaction should the opportunity present itself.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.
Eric Bolton: You bet.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from the side of Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird.
Drew Babin: Good morning, guys. Great quarter.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Drew.
Albert Campbell: Good morning, Drew. Thanks.
Drew Babin: Question on dispositions, considering that you’re selling your non-core, more treasury assets [indiscernible] cap rated, it’s not inconceivable to me that the cap rates on – not your best assets but maybe a little up the quality spectrum could go perceivably in the low 5s or something like that. With selling slightly better assets the cap rates like that possibly the repurchase stock be anything that you would consider?
Eric Bolton: Well, again I think that we’re at a point right now where we are scratching and clawing and finding what we feel like are some pretty good investment opportunities in the deals, in the expansions and so forth that we’ve talked about that where we’ve put out money this year. And I think that the opportunities for, perhaps even better yields and returns are on the horizon. We’re very comfortable with the portfolio we have today, and so I mean we’re going to continue to look at it Drew, and think about what’s the right sort of plan to continue to improve the quality of the portfolio, but as I say we feel pretty good with what we’ve got right now. And so, commencing some effort right now to just continue to sell off a bunch of assets in an effort to buy back stock is not – it doesn’t seem justified right now, it doesn’t seem warranted. I think that conditions may change that would cause the math to differ from what it is and we may very well go in a different direction but right now, we’re just going to continue to be patient with putting capital out and see where we get to. And meanwhile continue to harvest the value out of the existing portfolio that we have, and continue to put forth what we believe is likely to be pretty good core effort for growth.
Drew Babin: Portfolio improvement, obviously some of your assets with – and it’s up for CapEx needs are around the door now. And as you go forward, I mean is there any way you can quantify your maintenance CapEx spend per unit and where that may go next year relative to this year on a percentage basis?
Albert Campbell: I think this year recurring capital is $600 to $650 per unit and I think that obviously reflects some of the assets we sell this year. Likely it’ll maintain around that $600 unit range as we continue to invest what we need in our portfolio. Overtime it is conceived that would come down as we continue to put new rack that…
Eric Bolton: That came down from last year’s same store group change.
Albert Campbell: Yes, that’s a good point, it did come down from last year. And so we would expect that general trends to continue probably slowly as we continue to recycle though, Drew.
Drew Babin: Great, thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from the side of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.
Buck Horne: Hey, thanks. I wanted to go back to the comment about the portfolio mix, the urban loop discussion versus suburban and I was wondering if you could just help us quantify where the portfolio stands today in terms of what you would consider, how much NOI is coming from urban core versus suburban and then ideally what would you like the longer term or ideal mix of that urban versus suburban to look like?
Eric Bolton: Well, today I mean I would put it at close to suburban locations I’ll put probably 60%, 65%, inner loop probably in the 20% range and more traditional urban as a balance. But there is not a specific goal per se, I mean for the – it really starts with where are the best opportunities to deploy cap and create it’s best return on capital and I just believe that some of the better buying opportunities are going to be in some of the more urban locations over the next couple of years, because that’s where all the supply is largely coming out online. I think it’s also important to recognize that in a lot of these Southeast markets in particular, some of the more attractive apartment submarkets are in these suburban locations and I can – I mean that’s where a lot of the employment base presides. You’ve tend to see a lot newer retail, newer entertainment, restaurant venues and high quality product some of the better school systems. And so I think that we like having a very healthy sort of suburban component to our portfolio given the region of the country we do business in, because that’s where people want to live and that’s where some of the best apartments, submarkets exists. So, I think that on overtime just as a consequence of looking for the better investment opportunities I wouldn’t be surprised to see our suburban mix going a little down to close to 50%, and the inner loop and the urban sort of split 25% of piece and that probably be a pretty good mix, and I think that that’s I would be surprised to see there is trend in that direction but I think it’s important to – there is not a specific target for the portfolio as a whole as much as it’s more of a market driven kind of an analysis.
Buck Horne: Okay, that’s helpful. And then secondly, just going to an affordability kind of question, no offense that Charleston [indiscernible] over the world but you don’t quite generate the same level of income as you would out in Southern California or the Bay Area. So, how do you think about the rent increases you guys are generating and how are you seeing the rent income ratio as trend and how much further do you think you can keep saying aggressive on price before you run into some affordability issues?
Eric Bolton: Yeah. I think affordability in the country is an issue and it certainly is to agree in our market but on a comparative basis, we have a long way to run. So probably in 2011 Buck, we peaked at our rent income ratio at about 18.5% and I think the national average is closer to 30%. It’s dropped since then and frankly there is not really much of a trend, it’s just sort of balance between 17% and 18%. Given the turnovers at in all time low move-outs to rent increases are low, and as a steady stream of people willing to move in, I just don’t worry about it much on this point, but at a social level it’s a point of concern, but as a – it’s an issue that our company is dealing with well at this point. Our markets are handling very well.
Buck Horne: Okay, thank you. Great quarter.
Eric Bolton: Sure. Thanks, Buck.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from the side of John Benda from National Securities. John, your line is open.
John Benda: Hey, good morning [indiscernible].
Eric Bolton: Hey John, good morning.
John Benda: So just a really quick question for you, can you guys talk about the current expansion opportunities in your distant portfolio, maybe for assets that were – that kind of came online in 7, 8, 9 and going to downturn and then the second phase it starts to roll out. Is that a big opportunity for you?
Eric Bolton: We have a few more – I put maybe a handful of additional opportunities but not much. We’ve capture most of that. We’re always, we’re looking at a couple of acquisitions right now that has some expansion components to it but most of that has been captured at this point.
John Benda: Okay, and then just secondly, who you’re seeing as the main sellers when you’re looking at [indiscernible]? There is a lot of banks – is the banks finally unloading ROE that they put back and kind of waited your turn around before they have to take the mark on there or?
Eric Bolton: No, it’s really small regional developers or smaller regional or local developers is typically who we’re dealing with. On the acquisition front really I can’t think of anything that we’ve acquired the last five years, it’s been bought out of a foreclosure or bankruptcy or anything of that nature. So it’s really just small developers, private equity that kind of thing.
John Benda: All right, thank you very much.
Eric Bolton: Yeah.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from the side of Carol Kemple from Hilliard W.L. Lyons. Please go ahead.
Carol Kemple: Good morning.
Eric Bolton: Hey Carol.
Albert Campbell: Hey Carol.
Carol Kemple: I noticed your property management expenses dropped year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Was there anything specific or should that be a good run rate going forward?
Thomas Grimes: I think the important thing to notice there, there is some noise year-over-year given the merger and all the things we had gone on from IT cost and inner changes and all those things I think Carol, if we’re to point to capture on that and if you look at property management expenses and the G&A, we think of that as overhead together, we combine those buckets together in our minds and our projects and think about it. Those two lines together, the year-to-date run rate you’re seeing is right on for the year. And so if you take that year-to-date run rate those two double it, you’ll come up right at the midpoint of our guidance for overhead which is our property management and G&A for the year. So we’re right on track, that’s fully inclusive of capturing all the $25 million in same synergies that we talked about over the last year or two. And so it’s on track and we feel good about that.
Carol Kemple: Okay, thanks.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Carol.
Operator: And at this time, we do have no further questions.
Eric Bolton : All right, well thank you very much for being on the call this morning. And I hope to talk to everyone soon, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in the MAA First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, we would like to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Leo. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the safe harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and appreciate, everyone joining us this morning. We had a strong start to the year with first quarter results ahead of our expectations. The outperformace was driven by solid operating results with same-store NOI growing 5.8% as compared to prior year. Tom will walk you through more specifics surrounding pricing and the factors driving revenue performance. But overall, we continue to enjoy a favorable leasing environment as job growth and strong demand across our markets are more than offsetting new supply deliveries. Continued progress and harvesting opportunities coming out of our merger with Colonial is also contributing to operating momentum. The lift in performance we captured in the back half of last year from a number of operating improvements and scale benefits are continuing to generate solid year-over-year results. All aspects of our operations are now fully consolidated on to one platform and we're looking forward to continuing to improve and fine tune several processes that we believe will generate further lift in operating margin. The balance sheet remains in a strong position and we expect to see coverage metrics continue to improve over the course of the year. In his comments, Al will recap more details but we are particularly pleased with the progress in growing the unencumbered asset base with the higher level of asset sales and growing free cash flow, our overall debt level as a percentage of gross assets is declining and is also further strengthening the balance sheet. As recapped in yesterday's earnings release, we had very busy quarter with transactions. Including a group of properties that were sold earlier this week, we've completed the sale of 18 properties since the first of the year. We have an additional three properties on the contract and are expecting to close on those sales later in the summer. As we have outlined in last quarters earnings release, we believe that market conditions and the transaction markets supported and expedited executing of our plans to exit this 21 properties in smaller secondary markets. We are very pleased with the execution and an average age to 25 years and located exclusively in smaller markets this group of 18 properties that has been sold has an average rent that is 21% below our same-store portfolio average. Based on trailing 12-month NOI, total capital spending averaging approximately 1200 per unit and a 4% management fee, we captured a 5.6% cap rate on the sale of these properties. Going forward, as we've been doing for the past few years we will continue to consider opportunities to recycle capital from properties in markets where we believe we can reinvest to capture more attractive long-term value but it's worth noting, that with the dispositions being completed this year. In addition to the significant volume of dispositions and capital recycling completed over the past few years, we've now sold over 11,000 units since 2010. As a result, you can expect us to execute our capital recycling on more of a match funding basis going forward and exiting an additional 11 markets this year we have now repositioned the portfolio for stronger and more efficient execution. I’d like to point out that as a result of this capital recycling along with a number of other improvements we’ve made to both the operating and financing platforms for both the legacy MAA and CLP portfolios, we've seen MAA same-store NOI margin over the last five years improve 430 basis points. When considering capital spending of both recurring and revenue enhancing items, the same-store NOI margin has improved 550 basis points since its calendar year 2010. On the acquisitions front, we continue to underwrite a number of new opportunities and deal flow remains high, but extremely competitive. As we move further into the new supply delivery cycle, I continue to believe that we’ll see more investment opportunities that meet our long established investment hurdles. As noted in yesterday's earnings release, during the quarter we started a Phase II expansion of our property in Fredericksburg Virginia and are currently planning to also start additional expansions of properties we own in Orlando and in Charleston. We also remain active with discussions with developers on several opportunities to acquire properties on a pre-developed or lease up status. In summary, we like the momentum we’re seeing and believe that the benefits being harvested from our merger coupled with the capital recycling we completed further supports a more efficient operation and higher internal growth profile. The balance sheet is well positioned and we remain poised, but disciplined to continue to capture growth opportunities that we feel are likely to increase as we move further into the cycle. That's all I have in prepared comments. And I'll now turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Grimes: Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. Our 5% revenue growth was driven by a strong average fiscal occupancy of 95.6%, up 60 basis points from the prior year coupled with average rent per unit growth of 3.9% and good fee performance. April trends continue to be encouraging. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacant plus all notices for a 60 day period is just 8.3%. This is down 130 basis points from the same time last year. Our blended year-over-year pricing for April was up 6%, which is 200 basis points higher than this time last year. While expenses were better than we expected, there are few timing notes on the expense lines. Our personnel and marketing expenses reflect timing and congruities related to the discontinuation of legacy CLP programs last year. This affects first quarter comparisons only. We expect both lines to be below 3% for the full year. The benefits of our strong operating platform on a legacy CLP communities continues to pay dividends. The more robust approach of our revenue management team has grown rents at CLP communities more than 150 basis points higher than their market peers. Our system customizations that allow for fees and collections to be automatically build on the CLP platform has improved delinquency and fee collections for the quarter. We’re excited about our new repair and maintenance inventory process. This new initiative - with this new initiative our vendor stocks and replenishes are onsite shops with their owned inventory. We then purchase the inventory when it’s used by our teams. This maximizes our scale discounts and the speed of service to the resident. It minimizes the amount of time our team spends on procurement and increases efficiency onsite. This process gives us the right part at the right cost at the right time. This is another example of how our scale and operating sophistication creates value for our residents and our shareholders. On the market front, vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results in places like Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, and Tampa. In the secondary markets, which have lower supply pressure we're benefiting from accelerating job growth and this group Charleston, Greenville, and Savannah stand out. Jacksonville's 4% revenue growth is also notable. Further illustrating the demand of that market is our newly developed 220 Riverside project. We delivered our first units last week in that 294 unit community, is already 58% pre-leased with rents above pro forma. We expect our four communities in Memphis to show year-over-year improvement as the last year plays out - as the year plays out and job growth builds. We’re in very good shape in Houston, but continue monitoring our portfolio closely and we will remain sensitive to any changes and demand. During the quarter, Houston generated 6.6% revenue on rent growth, turnover for the quarter was down 8%. For the month of April, Houston's average physical occupancy was 96.1% and year-over-year blended rents for April were up 7.7%. It was at this time last year that the heavy lifting of our system integration improvements began. The year later, we’re in a different place. Our platform is fully integrated, our people are having fun with the new systems, and the benefits of the merger been harvested. I'm excited about what our teams have accomplished thus far and looking forward to what's to come. Now turn the call over to Al.
Albert Campbell: Okay, thank you Tom, and good morning everyone. I’ll provide some additional commentary on the company's first quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then the expectations for the remainder of the year. FFO for the first quarter was $105.2 million or $1.34 per share. Core FFO, which excludes certain non-cash and non-routine items was $95.6 million or $1.32 per share, as compared to $89.5 million or $1.21 per share for the prior year. And this core FFO per share performance was $0.03 above the midpoint of our previous guidance and represents a 9.1% growth over the prior year. Core AFFO for the first quarter was $94.6 million or $1.19 per share producing a solid coverage over our $0.77 per share quarterly dividend. Strong results from our same-store portfolio as discussed by Tom produced the majority of the favorability to our forecast as both our revenues and expenses were slightly favorable to projections. Performance from our lease up properties also progressed as planned and our overhead and interest expenses were essentially inline with the expectations for the quarter. Our G&A expenses are little front loaded this year reflecting the timing of certain items, but we expect this to normalize over the course of the year and we remain very confident in our projection for combined G&A and property management expenses of $56.5 million to $58.5 million for the full year fully reflected by the synergies captured from the Colonial merger. During the first quarter we acquired one 298 units luxury properties for $46.5 million and we sold four older properties for combined [Audio Gap] as we sold an additional 14 communities for combined gross proceeds of $180 million, which we’ll use to pay down our line of credit during the second quarter. We also continue construction on the two properties under development at year end and we began construction on a Phase II expansion at an existing community located in Fredericksburg Virginia. We funded $5 million of construction cost during the first quarter and we expect to fund an additional $25.5 million to complete these three projects. Our current plans anticipate $50 million to $60 million of total construction spending for 2015 just based on additional expansion opportunities as well. We prepared for the planned assets sales as well as to continue improving our balance sheet. During the first quarter we paid off a $116 million of secured Fannie Mae debt, as well as an additional $15.2 million single mortgage. We incurred $3.4 million of debt extinguishment charges related to these payoffs, but the vast majority of this expense was non-cash write-offs or deferred financing cost. We also have about $315 million of debt maturities remaining for the year primarily occurring in the fourth quarter. And as mentioned before, we currently plan to utilize the public bond markets to refinance this later this year. The average interest rate for the majority of these maturities is well above 5%, which is projected produced on fairly significant interest rate savings giving current markets. At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet remains in great shape, our total debt to market capital is 36.1%. Our fixed charge coverage ratio was [Audio Gap], 70% of our assets were now encumbered, which is a record for the company and over 92% of our debt is fixed or hedged against rising interest rates. And given the level of asset sales and projected internal cash flow, our current plans for the year do not include new equity. At quarter end, we had over $335 million of total cash and credit available under Atlanta credit supporting our liquidity. We expect to end the year with our leverage on a net gross asset basis to be about 41% down from the 42%, - 42.6% at the end of 2014. Finally we are maintaining our current guidance for core FFO and AFFO for the full year. We were encouraged by the first core performance from our same-store portfolio as we continue to capture benefits from the Colonial merger. But as mentioned in our last call, we do expect tougher comparisons in the back half of this year as post-merger more normalized quarters began compared periods of synergy capture last year. We feel good about our current operating momentum but given that the bulk of our leasing activity and significant transaction activity, are ahead of us for this year, we will wait to visit guidance with our second quarter earnings report. As a reminder, our core FFO is projected to be 5.09 to 5.33 per share or 5.21 at the mid-point based on average shares and units outstanding we’re about 79.5 million. Core AFFO is projected to be 4.43 to 4.67 per share or 4.55 at the mid-point, which is a 6.3% increase over 2014. The major components of this guidance are outlined in our supplemental data packets that accompanied our press release and also I will point out that we had some additional details regarding our operating expenses to our supplemental disclosures this quarter which is on page S3. And so, we hope you find this helpful. That's all I have, and I'll now turn the call back over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Al. Before opening the lines for questions, I want to extent my thanks and appreciation for the hard work and excellent service our associates working on site and our properties provide for our residents. Our company culture is based on a strong service oriented mindset for both those who directly serve our residents and those of us who support them in our corporate and regional positions. As a result of this focus, MAA will be recognized later today as first among apartment management companies across the country as having the best online reputation based on an independent online power ranking survey conducted by J Turner Research. This recognition follows our designation earlier this year as having the best online reputation among the publicly traded apartment rates. This recognition speaks to both our team's dedication to serving our residents, as well as to the strength and sophistication of our operating platform. That's all we have in the way prepared comments. So Leo, I am going to turn it back to you for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Rob Stevenson of Janney.
Rob Stevenson: Good morning, guys. Al, what drove the tweaks in the third and fourth quarter guidance today versus what you knew first week of February or so?
Albert Campbell: Hi Rob. It's really timing of items. As we mentioned in the comments, we feel good about our full year guidance reaffirm that, we'll readdress that in the second quarter call. Surely timing of items and I will say primarily transaction activity the biggest unknown at this point really is more the transaction activity. We sold a lot of assets. Obviously, we have plan in our forecast to put that capital back to work throughout the year. So, that timing of that changed a little bit, causing the most of that.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And them Tom, can you talk about where new and renewals were, sort of, month-by-month on the trend there? And then, sort of, are there any markets where you are seeing very big gaps between those or where you are seeing the biggest gaps?
Tom Grimes: Rob it was pretty consistent across the board on a year over year basis. New leases were 56, renewals 57, blended 57. For April it's 63, 56 and 60 and then looking forward May 75 and we were – offers went out at 75, we got 68 in June 75, 61 at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gaurav Mehta of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Gaurav Mehta: Thanks, good morning. Just a couple of questions on your same-store numbers. If I look at your NOI it's 5.8% for 1Q and then you just gave the numbers for new and renewals, which seems encouraging and I know you mentioned that you are expecting tougher comps towards the second half of the year but going from 5.8% to 3% to 4% guidance it seems, like quite a bit of slow down. So outside of tough comps, is there anything else you are looking at?
Eric Bolton: Not really. I think that – it's again what we are facing is reality that a lot of the improvements that we begin to capture in our operating metrics out of the Colonial portfolio really began to show up in the back half of last year as well as some lift that we got from some scale benefits and we are working a lot of contracts. So, we will be comparing against those comps. All that improvement, all that lift of course, is permitted if you will, but just on a year-over-year basis the comps get little bit more challenging. And to be honest with you too, I think that we are carrying fairly strong occupancy at this point and we were carrying fairly strong occupancy in the back half of last year. And so, lift on a year-over-year basis and effective occupancy becomes pretty challenged. And there is some assumptions that if the economy continues to improve and we begin to see that employment markets continue to show recovery, I think it's also reasonable to assume, there may be a little pick up and turnover that begins to take place. So, those are all the various variables that I think one has to think through over the back half of this year. We don't certainly see anything materially weakening and you are right, all the trends that we are seeing right now are pretty encouraging but we still got long way to go and that's really gets us to where we feel pretty automate that we already hold tight at this point and then readdress it as we get to the end of the summer.
Gaurav Mehta: Okay. And my follow up question is on transactions where you sold assets for economic cap rate of 5.6%, as you look to deploy that capital towards acquisition, what kind of cap rates are you targeting?
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean most of what we are seeing today, we are seeing economic cap rates that would be 5 to 5.5, frankly pretty tight spread. Most of what we are targeting, of course, is newly built brand new so the CapEx requirements are fairly minor and are low. And so, based on our hurdles and the criteria that we use is we think about deploying capital, the spread would be fairly narrow to what we sold.
Gaurav Mehta: All right. Thank you. That's all I had.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital.
John Kim: Thank you. I guess my first question is on the economic cap rate of 5.6%. This is I think what was previously characterized as an AFFO yield, correct?
Al Campbell: We talked about that a lot on our previous call John, we talked about our FFO yield and then the cash flow cap rate. I think we did discuss the cash flow cap rate which is our new [indiscernible] for a moment. Trailing 12 months actual NOI, minus of 4% managed fee and then minus to actual CapEx on this portfolio which is Eric mentioned is common. So, it's about $1,200 a unit. And that's how that calculated. I think we did mention at our previous call, there was some discussion about it, NOI yield versus the cash flow, the cash flow obviously is what we feel is important, that's what you are selling to an investor and we thought that was a very good outcome.
John Kim: What was the NOI yield?
Al Campbell: The NOI yield was – NOI basically was close to 8%.
John Kim: Okay. And my final question is on the performance versus - of the core versus your secondary markets. As noticed, it widened out with this period, is this really showing that having scale in your markets drives the NOI growth? And can you remind us what the balance of core versus secondary markets is ideal for you and under which timeframe?
Eric Bolton: Let me take the later part of the question and maybe Tom can pick the first part. I would tell you that today we are sitting roughly around 60%, what we refer to as large markets, and 40% referred to as secondary markets. And that’s really kind of the portfolio strategy allocation that we are really after [Audio Gap] it's not the way we think about it. We are after certain portfolio mix. We feel like we have that now and then, of course, what's happening in the secondary markets, broadly speaking is, that we are seeing things starting to pick up and improve there. And Tom, you want to - 
Tom Grimes: At 3.7% year-over-year revenue growth along with 1% in sequential revenue growth which attracts the large market group pretty well, we are encouraged with the trends that we are seeing. And then furthermore based on the recent recap of job growth released by the VLS, just recently comparing Q1 of this year to Q1 of last year in the large markets, they moved up by 40 basis points and our secondary markets about 120 basis points So we’re sort of encouraged with the revenue on and the jobs picture looking forward in this group.
Eric Bolton: And the secondary markets generally continue to not see much in the way of supply pressure, not nearly as aggressive did you see in the larger market. So a combination, we always felt that as we get further into the economic recovery that these secondary markets would begin to show their improved strength and that’s we think that’s what we’re starting to see at this point.
John Kim: Thank you.
Eric Bolton: Thank you, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim of Zelman & Associates.
Dan Oppenheim: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about some of the comments in terms of the second half of the year in terms of just being having concerned whether turnover raises or just slowing based on the, I can see levels there but if you’re looking at the trends in terms of renewals for May and June, are you seeing anything different in terms of the behavior of tenants in terms of percentage renewing at this point and or is that anything leading to that for this, in terms of the second half of the year or is it more just overall caution?
Eric Bolton: We’re not seeing anything on from marketing leasing, the market fundamentals or leasing fundamentals that causes us concern, I mean occupancies are strong as Tom outlined, rent trends are strong, turnover remains low, so there is nothing from an operating perspective or market perspective that gives us pass at this point. I think what we’re just the point we’re trying to make here is that, we’ve got tougher comps coming out, we’ve got both in terms of the benefits we got last year from some of the benefits are coming out of the merger and we were fairly full occupancy towards the back half of last year and so I think the only thing that would cause and so going above and beyond those two sort of improvements last year is going to be challenging because we’re still carrying very strong occupancy and we’re looking at if you call frictional vacancy a little bit and thinking about things we can do to sort of improve and minimize further downtime between turns and things of that nature. So on the margin we still think there is some opportunities along those lines on occupancy as well as in the operating platform but fundamentally a lot of the benefits and that we got over the back half of last year presents some challenging comps this year. And the only other thing I would tell you, that causes us to think that, it’s time to sort of stick to what we think is going to happen at this point of our guidance is the fact that if the employment market continues to show recovery and we continue to see the job markets show recovery, I think that, it’s reasonable to expect that the turnover may pickup just a little bit, that’s typically what happens and that’s okay, I mean where the demand side of the equation is very strong and our move outs to rent increase continues to not be worry some trend. And so little pick up in turnover is not something that worries us, now that the fact is it make cause vacancy to move up slight amount is a consequence of that but we’re preparing for that and we think we’ve got a good chance to minimize that but that’s, just the context of what we’re sort of working with here that causes us to think that we need to get through kind of the summer leasing season and take a look at where we are and at that point, consider whether or not we’ll be making revisions to our current guidance.
Dan Oppenheim: Got it, okay and then I guess secondly then in terms of the acquisitions and had that one in Kansas City in the first quarter, clearly you’re well on your way to selling the multi family community to 233 million sold out of this week, as you think about buying the communities. Are you more cautious in the ability to buy based on having discipline in terms of looking for the right yields in those given the competition in the markets right now.
Eric Bolton: Well, certainly the market is very competitive, but I continue to believe that as we get later in the cycle and more the new products comes online, we typically see that point developers and equity partners become a little bit more likely that want to monetize your profit soon or rather than later. It’s lease up and depending on the locations can become little bit more challenging and you throw on top of that, the prospect of rising interest rates or highest cost of capital and I think the motivation to monetize profits from some of these developers grows even more and so I don’t believe we’re likely looking at conditions weakening to a point where the environment becomes the buyers markets by any means but the ability to source better buying opportunities, I think thus improve slightly and with our execution capabilities as a buyer, we think that that nets out to more opportunity as we get later into the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley.
Haendel St. Juste: Hi, good morning guys. So would you talk a bit more about the price the demand for the assets you’re selling, do the pricing exceed your expectations, what would the type of the buyer that showed up, the definite demand whether any re-trading and was there a portfolio premium or perhaps discount in the negotiation for the price?
Eric Bolton: Well, I think that, I mean this is a group that we’ve known for a while, we sold some properties to them last year, they have proven themselves as being a very credible buyers able to execute very well. And so we – and so we’re going to look at our disposition plans for the year, we had conversations with them as well as few other groups and felt like that we would probably achieve better execution and better net returns for our shareholders at approaching this on a sort of a bulk basis transaction portfolio if you will. And so that’s the way we went at it and this buyer that is a private equity vary credible representing institutional capital that we talked to and they were interested in everything we had to sell for the year and so we began conversations with them and, no there was no retreading, we gave them an exclusive opportunity and frankly the numbers came in better than we expected and so we were pretty pleased overall with how it turned out.
Al Campbell: I add that because I think that Fannie and Freddie have widened up their spreads by I think 40 basis points over, since the start of the year, I’m just curious that might have be playing any part in your conversations with potentially interested parties for your assets.
Eric Bolton: Okay. Think about, when they increase their spreads the treasure rate also came down and the other side of that to help that as well, I think Haendel but in various comments that, we didn’t feel that in this transaction. 
Al Campbell: No, not at all and I know that, the buyer for these assets is using Freddie financing and so, they were pretty pleased with, I know they moved early this year to lock in their rates and we do feel that, there was reason to move sooner rather than later on these disposition plans for all those reasons and so we glad we got it done.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay, and then for the three end of contract wondering if you can talk a bit about how much, talk about absolute dollars perhaps cap rates are they pretty similar to what you sold already and may be markets if you wish?
Eric Bolton: Well, the assets that we have are in two other smaller markets, we’ve got another and another asset in Memphis, we’ll be exiting two more smaller markets as a consequence of these last three sales, prefer not to get into pricing at this point. But it’s going to be very much along with what we’ve been doing.
Al Campbell: And the volume will pretty much complete our guidance expectations for the years, that gives you the remaining dollars.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom Lesnick of Capital One.
Tom Lesnick: Hi, thanks for taking my questions, I heard you mentioned that strengthening job market in some of your secondary markets but I’m just curious is there any evidence and otherwise of an uptick in wage growth in any of the secondary markets, are you seeing less sensitivity from the rent increases?
Eric Bolton: We have not seen much sensitivity to rent increases from resonance that move outs for rent increases remain roughly flat and then our rent to income ratio has held steady at about 16.5% as we’ve gotten through. So something is the correlation between the increases in rents is being supported by increases in wages looking at that ratio.
Tom Lesnick: Okay, nice and then just a bigger picture question, Eric, I know you guys are just getting through the integration but just given recent deal activity and consolidation in the apartment sector that there is still several pure plays of these department entities both public and private still out there, are you guys amicable to further deal activity, what’s your mindset as you come through the entire problem stays turns out right now.
Eric Bolton: Well, I’m not going to speculate on M&A activity overall but I do believe that our focus is just continuing to strengthen our earnings platform through executing on the strategy that we’ve laid our and we’re excited about the trends that we’re seeing and what’s being accomplished. Having said that I mean yeah I mean we’re always we talk to folks all the time and we’re always interested in exploring a new investment opportunities. And so we remain in the market. And we’re obviously learned a lot through the process with Colonial, we feel very good about the platform that we have in place and we’re glad to see the dust settle little bit and we’re perfectly content to continue refining what we’ve got and improving what we’ve got. But we’re also interested, always open to other ideas and opportunities. So we’ll see what the future holds.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities.
Rich Anderson: Thanks good morning.
Eric Bolton: Hi Rich.
Al Campbell: Good morning, Rich.
Rich Anderson: So the last three remaining are apparently much larger assets if it’s three assets under million or so. Is there anything about the size and assuming I have that right, is there anything about the size of the assets that’s making at slower processes as it to that same private equity buyer?
Al Campbell: It’s with the same buyer, and no I mean there is nothing in particular about the size that’s making an challenge, we just staged these things to accommodate their needs and they’re all under contract and we’re pretty confident it will happen but yeah you’re right I mean the one of them in particular is large community over 1000 units. So but no complications per se that I can point to you.
Rich Anderson: Okay and then some people are asking whether or not you should be raising your guidance and you’re talking about the tough back half comps, but maybe if I think about little bit differently do you think you executed even faster than you thought you might have going in and hence earlier than expected dispositions maybe weighs on your FFO growth more than you thought. Is that a rationale line of thinking?
Al Campbell: Well I think there’s some truth to that I think that’s part of it, but I think it’s really the uncertainty surrounding acquisitions more than anything that causes us to be reluctant to jump on any kind of increase at this point. I mean we felt like that that the value opportunity, the value creation opportunity associated with expediting as quickly as we could on the dispositions made sense. And even if the risk of pressuring earnings a little more than we expected this year we think it was the right thing to do long-term from a value perspective. And the acquisitions as I said earlier I mean we’re talking to lot of people about lot of different ideas right now and a lot of different opportunities. It’s competitive and the thing that’s easy to do right now is lose your discipline and we’re not going to do that. And so we’re going to remain patient, I’m encouraged with the deal flow, I’m encouraged with the activity that we see taking place in our transactions team. And we’re having lot of conversations and there’s lot of reason to be optimistic. But I can’t be certain and so we just think at this point be a little bit cautious on our ability to put the money to work and hopefully we’ll have something good to say later this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky of RBC.
Michael Salinsky: Good morning guys.
Eric Bolton: Good morning.
Michael Salinsky: Eric where you see the better opportunities currently either primary or secondary and as you’re underwriting growth rates on transactions to-date. How does the growth rate being underwritten for a primary market, compared with secondary market just at this point of cycle?
Eric Bolton: Well I’ll tell you the buying opportunities are pretty competitive across the Board, I mean we’ve been looking at transactions down the South Florida, Atlanta, Phoenix, based on what we believe is very reasonable, not conservative by any means underwriting deals trading at sub-5 cap rates. We’ve just lost on a couple of deals in secondary markets like Kansas City and San Antonio foreign capital buyers sub-5 cap rates and so it’s pretty aggressive across the Board and I think that it’s for us what we’re finding more opportunity with right now is talking with developers on deals that are either getting ready to get started or they’re in lease up. And I think that there is some evidence building that folks were getting a little bit more anxious to go ahead as I said in my comments to monetize their profits that they’ve got and we’re looking of course to bring brand new product into the portfolio on something less than a full retail price. And that’s where we find those opportunities generally is at this point of cycles with developers who are in the early stages of development and/or lease up and we’re comfortable taking on the lease up risk.  And that gets us to that question you’re asking about sort of rent growth. And of course it varies in underwriting, it varies a lot by market obviously, but I would tell you that we’re probably a little bit more cautious in our rent growth forecast in today than where we were say a year ago or two years ago I just feel like we’re little further into the cycle. I think that supply continues to not be a worry some trend at this point relative to the demand side of the equation. But I would not be as aggressive today in underwriting as I was a year or two ago.
Michael Salinsky: That’s helpful. And just thinking little along the same lines there as you mentioned development potential, see potential buying out and take on lease up risk. What’s the right spread today I think you mentioned a 5 to 5.5 cap rate. What’s the right spread on property where you will take lease up responsibility versus a ground up to justify the other risk particularly at this point of cycle?
Eric Bolton: Yes it could be 100 to 150 basis points is generally what we’re looking at and I guess again it varies somewhat by specific opportunity and other metrics, but we’re looking for 100 to 150 basis point spread generally.
Michael Salinsky: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes good morning two quick ones from me. The first one I may have missed this but could you give us a sense of just your general outlook for Texas at this point just kind of given all the oil and gas concerns?
Al Campbell: Sure Tayo, the Texas in general I just batted around by market is Houston is performing admirably for us at this point, the feedback we get from our folks on the ground is makes us one to monitor closely the oil and gas jobs were having affect in greater Houston, we’re not seeing that affected our properties at the moment. But we remain attuned to them, Austin continues to move on along and do very well we’re excited about it honestly and it seems to be managing a new supply well, which tends to be focused more on the Downtown, central Austin area. And then Dallas and Fort Worth, Fort Worth honestly little more encouraged than Dallas, but both are good. Dallas just has heavy supply in Uptown moving up to a Plano, which affects just probably three of our properties in the Medical District and little new construction around Las Colinas. But we’re still optimistic about say Texas in general, the oil and gas concerns in Houston are benefits to those other markets who are paying less at the pump.
Omotayo Okusanya: And that’s helpful. And then just in regards to asset sales going forward and I know you’re planning to do stuff in a more match funded basis going forward. But could you just talk to us especially in the secondary markets about just how deep the buyer pool is there. I mean you’re doing a lot with this one private equity shop, but kind of who else is missing around and what are they kind of and in general don’t know just how strong is the market in those secondary markets where you’re looking to sell?
Eric Bolton: Yes I would tell you it’s very strong, I was alluding to some of the pricing that we’re seeing recently on some transactions in Kansas City and in San Antonio, but we get calls all the time from folks who are looking deploy capital in secondary markets and multi-family real estate and these are smaller buyers to institutional buyers along lines of who are selling till today. So it’s quite strong, I mean and we’re of course - Fannie and Freddie and the agency financing is wide open for secondary markets as well. And so I think that as a consequence of exiting these 11 markets this year that I would characterize smaller, more tertiary in nature than most of the residual secondary markets that we have left over, I would think that the buyer approval for any future sales that we may have would be a strong or stronger than what we’re seeing right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird.
Drew Babin: Good morning guys. Question, on second half of the year just given what you're saying with the expense growth comps, as well as possibly flat to slightly down occupancy, the revenue growth, and the NOI growth is going to have mostly come from rent growth. Can you kind of quantify how ROI renovations you’ve done since Colonial acquisition may kind of help boost revenues? And then also whether many turnover they are expecting in the second half of the year, whether you look at that as an opportunity to maybe get into the units and tune things up to get better rents?
Eric Bolton: Drew we did about 2000 units on the Colonial side last year and we will do about similar for a total of 4000. So on a year-over-year basis, we’re going to be doing about the same, so the comparative bump is not materially there. If we do units sooner, which were running a little bit ahead, we will do that but all in all it’s about 20 basis points of revenue bump that will come from the redevelopment program. Now we're also mid-way, really early in the roll-out, very early in the roll out of our washer and dryer program and it works very similar to our redevelopment program being essentially adding washer dryers to the mix, to the unit and charging additional fee. We test that, we run that, just like we do the innovated program, that could generate about an extra half million dollars in the back half of the year.
Drew Babin: Okay. I appreciate the detail. And then on - lastly just on Raleigh and then kind of Florida in general markets where the rent growth has been kind of below average for different portfolio, just maybe talk about Raleigh and how a supply maybe not - supply growth may or may not be trailing off there. And can you just about Florida, there is always some supply in Florida, it is not always the highest quality supply but what do you think is underpinning some of the marginal weakness in multiple Florida markets?
Eric Bolton: I'll start with Raleigh and what I would tell you Drew is obviously we – that's been a high sales growth market - a high delivery market for a while, it's been specifically high in that Brier Creek area which we have high exposure to. We are pretty encouraged that that is stabilizing and we like our rent trends so far in Raleigh and we like where we’re going. Just to give you an idea, average occupancy in Raleigh right now is 95.6, exposures is just 8.1. That is down 260 basis points from the prior year. And April blended rents were 3.8. So honestly we feel like our portfolio on Raleigh is rebounding now. I'm pleased to continue. On the Florida side, honestly we’re pretty excited with what Jacksonville, and Orlando and Tampa are doing right now and feel pretty good about them going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Segall of Green Street.
David Segall: Hello. I was just curious on the developments. Do you have any sense of why was the stabilization date delayed by a quarter for both Riverside and Bellevue. And also why the budget increased slightly since last quarter?
Eric Bolton: I will address - in Bellevue we had some weather delays over the winter that pushed us back a little bit but everything is on track at this point and so just some weather delays. In Jacksonville, we just ran - the developer ran into some construction delays that were just fairly minor in nature but in an effort to just be sure that we had the property at a point where we were comfortable allowing people to move in, we just pushed delivery back to just a tad. And as Tom mentioned, our preleasing is going extremely well there and so we are delivering units there starting I guess next week, and move-ins are starting next week but the properties are already 58% preleased. So with returns and expectations on both of those deals are very much intact.
Tom Grimes: The increase in the cost, I’ll just give you little color on that is really primarily capitalized taxes and the interest because of the slight delays Eric mentioned and obviously on IRR basis that's the same cash as we had expected, it is no difference, it doesn’t impact the returns.
David Segall: Great. And do you have a sense of the expected yield on the Fredericksburg expansion?
Tom Grimes: Probably about 6 to 6.5 on that expansion which is kind of a wholesale price as we talked about, as Eric talked about of course we look to capture not a full development yield but pretty close.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi it's, [indiscernible] with Jordan. Just wanted to touch on CapEx for a moment, you guys mentioned on the dispositions, CapEx is running in about 1200 per unit. In the first quarter it looks like CapEx was little over $10 million, I'm not sure what that was on a per unit basis but just curious what you’re expecting on the residual portfolio from a CapEx perspective?
Tom Grimes: For the full year, we expect just over 900 to 915 a unit for the same-store portfolio. The first quarter CapEx was a little below the run rate for the year but on the $52 million recurrings that we expect for the full year, so you can do the math on that.
Eric Bolton: 915 inclusive of - people have different definitions of what CapEx is but that includes both what we refer to or often people call both recurring and revenue enhancing. So that’s an all in number if you will and 900 to 915 for the remainder of the portfolio.
Tom Grimes: For recurring, we expect about $52 million for the full year, so you can back into what is remaining for the last three quarters.
Jordan Sadler: It's Jordan here with [indiscernible]. I had a question regarding the gains reported during the quarter, a big number $134 million on the steps that teed up and I suspect there is going to be something incremental one, what's the total number expected for the year and then what are the plans for those gains as you see it now, are we going to 10.31 and then I’ll go from there?
Tom Grimes: Those are book gains, not tax gains, I will start with there, but we do expect significant tax gains that are sort in line with those numbers. We do expect to have more gains as we sell that remaining tranche in the second quarter or early in the third quarter when it occurs. And obviously we don’t expect a special dividend or anything like that related to it because we do plan to use both [indiscernible] and other tax planning techniques or strategies to cover that. So we are not concerned about any dividend issues or things along that line?
Jordan Sadler: And so as it relates to - so what do you think the total gains will look like either book or taxable however you want to present this, I suspect that taxable would be higher than book, but that's just a guess.
Tom Grimes: Tax gains will probably somewhere in the 225 to 250 range. And as we mentioned we have strategies that we expect [indiscernible] and other strategies to have all that cover but that's what we expect.
Operator: Our next question comes from Buck Horne of Raymond James.
Buck Horne: Good morning. Thanks for the time here. Going back to the supply picture question. Just, I mean it's pretty strong acceleration in some markets that have been notable for the amount of new deliveries that have been coming to them whether it's Austin, Charlotte, Houston those types of markets. You've spoken to this a little bit, but I guess what I'm trying understand is to what extent do you think the portfolio is kind of insulated from that supply pressure given you made the bulk of deliveries going to urban core product and I guess the real question is, are you seeing any signs that the developers are extending out into the suburbs and to your areas? Do you think that, that might add to supply pressure going forward for your portfolio?
Tom Grimes: Buck, of course it varies a lot by market but broadly speaking I think you’re right and where most of the supply pressures are happening in some of those markets that you mentioned are in more or sort of urban core area and candidly that’s what we’re seeing the buying opportunities that we’re talking to folks about and those markets are in those urban core areas and I think that’s where you’re going to see most of the - to the extent that the supply creates pressures on rent growth and any of these sub markets that's where it is going to be. And so that’s where we are hunting for opportunities right now. But I think that a lot of our existing product in some of these larger markets are in some of the more suburban locations as Thomas, Michigan, Austin, in Houston, in Dallas, and in Fort Worth and Charlotte I mean the trends are pretty good, we’re talking about Raleigh there earlier Brier Creek is a high end sub market area carry their holding up. They've got a little bit of supply last year and we’re little weak last year but the trends are pretty encouraging this year. And so I do think that as we get into this later part of the cycle where supply continues to come in, and I mean right now the demand is strong and we’re not concerned with any of the trends that we’re seeing and of course you’re never concerned until you are concerned. And I don’t think that it’s going to be the supply side of the equation. It’s going to really disrupt the train if you will, I think one day something will happen on the demand side and things will start to slow and that’s where you will run into some more those of moderation in terms of our ability to push rents. I don’t see that happening anytime soon but that is typically the way it happens and that’s why we feel like it’s important to keep a presence in some of these smaller secondary markets that we’re in because they tend to not see the supply pressure and they don’t tend to get as out of balance if you will at any point and we think that it’s an important part of protecting sort of the full cycle profile that we’re after. So, at this point I mean we’re still not seeing anything on the supply side, it causes us any real worry and wherever there maybe, little pockets here there generally where we are not but I think that's also going to create some buying opportunities for us.
Buck Horne: Very helpful. And just real quick, and any signs in the turnover ratios for move-outs due to buying or renting single family homes, anything noticeable there and the turnover is slow, but any color you can provide on that is helpful.
Tom Grimes: Buck it went from - buying house went from 18.7 to 18.8 of move-out, I mean it’s just flat and it’s not moving and it’s staying low honestly, same on move-outs to renting.
Eric Bolton: Yes, move-outs to renting is constitutes about little over 7% of our move-out right now and for 20 years this has been in the 5% to 7% range. So it is - we just continue to not worry about single family housing either for sale or for rent product is being a pressure point for us. To the extent that the single family housing market starts to show some meaningful recovery, I think that happens only because the employment markets are getting continued stronger and I think that works in our favor as well.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A session. I would like to return the call to Eric Bolton, for any concluding remarks.
Eric Bolton: No further comments from us. If you have got follow up questions please call us and we will see everyone at NAREIT. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating in the MAA Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Steve. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the safe harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34-Act filings with SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. [Operator Instructions] Thanks. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
H. Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter performance was strong, as favorable leasing conditions supported solid rent growth and continued strong occupancy, which along with good expense control, generated net operating income that was ahead of our expectations. As outlined in our initial guidance for calendar year 2014, momentum and operating performance increased during the year. Continued healthy leasing conditions, coupled with the growing benefits harvested out of our merger, supported the strong results that we expected over the back half of the year. Our merger integration activities are complete, and our focus is now fully attuned to further refining and enhancing our platform. The company is in a solid position as we look forward to 2015. As we ramp up 2014 with record earnings, I want to say to our entire team at MAA, thank you for your hard work and great efforts over the past 18 months to make our merger successful. Your efforts have our platform in a strong position and we have a great opportunity ahead of us to generate increasing value for our residents and shareholders. Solid revenue performance during the fourth quarter was driven by continued strong occupancy as average daily occupancy for the same-store portfolio was 95.5% or 40 basis points ahead of the prior year. Resident turnover remains low with the number of move-outs during the quarter, as compared to prior year, down slightly. Move-outs to buy a house were down 4.5% during the quarter. Taking a brief look at specific market performance for the quarter, Atlanta was our strongest market generating 7.6% revenue growth, with Houston, Dallas, Phoenix and Austin also generating good results. Within our Secondary Market segment of the portfolio, Greenville, South Carolina, generated strong growth in revenues at 7.3% over the prior year, with Savannah and Charleston also continuing to post solid performance. Looking at 2015, continued strength in employment trends across the Sunbelt suggest that despite projected higher levels of new supply coming online across a number of markets, rent growth prospects should continue to be above long-term trends. As outlined in our 2015 earnings guidance, we are forecasting revenue growth in the 3% to 4% range. We expect to be able to hold occupancy and capture the bulk of this performance from growing rents. Looking at the ratio of forecasted job growth to new apartment completions coming online in 2015, we expect to see our strongest performances out of Atlanta, Fort Worth and Phoenix. With steady improvement in new job growth forecast across a number of our Secondary Markets and continued modest levels of new supply, the ratio of job growth to new supply suggest that we should see also improving results from this segment of the portfolio in 2015. We expect to see good performances this year from Charleston, Fredericksburg, Greenville, and Savannah. As noted earlier, we have completed our most significant merger-related activities with all properties now on the same property management, revenue management, payables, accounting and management reporting platforms. The combination of adopting best on-site operating procedures and full integration of MAA's asset-management programs, coupled with benefits from a larger scale and synergy, resulted in an 80-basis-point improvement in operating margin from the Legacy-Colonial portfolio over the course of 2014. In addition, we captured a 30-basis-point improvement in the operating margin in the Legacy MAA portfolio during the year. At the time of our merger, we expected to generate combined NOI operating synergies of $0.05 to $0.11 per share, and now expect to fully capture the top end of this range. In addition with the organization now fully integrated, we expect to fully capture the anticipated G&A and overhead expense synergies of $25 million, or $0.32 per share, which is fully reflected in our guidance assumptions for 2015. Our redevelopment program continues to generate strong rent increases and long-term value. During 2014, we completed renovations of just over 4,500 units, which was a meaningful increase from the almost 2,600 units in calendar year 2013. We expect another big year of redevelopment in 2015, and are targeting in excess of 4,000 units with the much heavier emphasis on the Legacy-Colonial properties. In total, we believe we have 15,000 to 20,000 units of redevelopment opportunity within our same-store portfolio, and expect this program to be a multiyear contribution to earnings performance and value growth. As outlined in our guidance for 2015, we expect another active year of property dispositions and are targeting to sell $350 million to $425 million of properties, an increase from the $250 million of sales completed in 2014. Our capital recycling activity this year as compared to prior year will have a much heavier emphasis on multi-family assets and specifically legacy MAA properties located primarily in tertiary and select secondary markets. We expect to complete this disposition activity in the first half of the year, as we move to take advantage of current market conditions. Our transaction group is also busy with the increasing level of acquisition opportunities coming to market. As noted in the earnings release, we closed on 3 acquisitions in the fourth quarter, which were located in Atlanta, San Antonio, and Houston. We closed another acquisition in Kansas City in January. As one of the largest platforms focused exclusively on the Southeast and Southwest, a strong balance sheet with ample capacity, experience to efficiently execute for sellers and developers, and a focus on maintaining an active capital recycling program, we continue to be presented with a growing number of attractive new investments. We're estimating $400 million to $500 million of acquisitions in 2015, slightly ahead of the $400 million closed in 2014. We expect the opportunities to increase over the course of the year from both new, newly stabilized properties as well as properties that are still in their initial lease-up. We also continue to look at opportunities to prepurchase to-be-built properties and Phase II expansion of existing properties, but expect that at this point in the cycle, this will be a more selective component of our capital deployment activity, as we begin this year with $73 million of new development underway versus just over $200 million at this time last year. So overall, we expect a busy 2015 with continued stable leasing conditions and active capital recycling effort and a focus on further enhancing operating margins as we fine-tune and improve on a number of merger-related projects that were completed during 2014. We continue to feel good about our strategy and are excited about activities underway to further strengthen the platform. We look forward to another good year in 2015. That's all I have in the way of comments. I'll now turn the call over to Al.
Albert M. Campbell: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's fourth quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally, on our initial earnings guidance for 2015. We had strong earnings performance in the fourth quarter, which produced record levels of FFO per share for both the quarter and the full year of 2014. FFO for the quarter was $107.4 million, or $1.35 per share, and core FFO, which excludes certain unusual or nonrecurring items was $104.7 million or $1.32 per share, which was $0.06 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. Solid operating performance during the quarter from both our same-store and non same-store portfolios produced about $0.03 per share of this favorability, with another $0.03 per share coming from favorable G&A and interest costs during the quarter. The majority of the G&A savings during the quarter came from reduced insurance costs as lower current claims and revised projections for health insurance, workers' compensation and general liability insurance impacted both the current costs and year-end accruals. Since we've now owned the Colonial portfolio for 15 months, we transferred the Colonial communities to our actual same-store portfolio during the fourth quarter. However, full year comparisons for 2014 continue to be presented on a pro forma combined basis in our release, as we did not own the Colonial portfolio for the first 3 quarters of 2013. For the fourth quarter, the same-store portfolio produced 5.6% NOI growth over the prior year, based on a 4.2% growth in revenues and a 2.1% growth in operating expenses. As Eric mentioned, solid pricing performance and strong occupancy continued through the fourth quarter, producing 3.6% growth in effective rent, with an additional 40 basis points of growth coming from higher-than-average occupancy -- higher average occupancy during the quarter. On a pro forma combined basis, same-store NOI growth for the full year was 4.2%, based on a 3.4% growth in revenues and 2.1% growth in operating expenses. And the majority of increase in operating expenses for both the fourth quarter and the full year was related to real estate taxes, which increased 5.8% for the full year of 2014. During the fourth quarter, we invested a total of $191.8 million in 3 new communities acquired, located at Atlanta, San Antonio and Houston. We also funded an additional $11.7 million of construction cost from development communities, with an estimated $12.3 million remaining funding to complete the 2 communities under construction at year end. During the fourth quarter, we sold Colonial Promenade Huntsville, a 23,000-square-foot retail center as well as Town Park Moreya, a 25-acre plot of undeveloped land, both acquired in the Colonial merger. Combined proceeds of $12.3 million were received from these sales, and recorded net gains of $200,000 on asset sales during the fourth quarter. The only significant financing transactions during the fourth quarter were the assumption of a $40 million loan related to the Atlanta acquisition, and an amendment to a $150 million term loan, which effectively added an additional 3 years to the loan and reduced the borrowing spread by 25 basis points, taking full advantage of our strong credit rating. At the end of the fourth quarter, our balance sheet remains in great shape. Total company leverage based on market cap was 37.3%. Our fixed charge coverage ratio was about 4x, and total debt to recurring EBITDA was 6.4x. Over 96% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rate, and 67% of our assets were unencumbered at year-end. Also we had over $460 million of total cash and credit available under our unsecured line of credit at year-end. Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2015 with the release. Core FFO was projected to be $5.09 to $5.33 per share or $5.21 at the midpoint, based on average shares and units outstanding of about 79.5 million shares. Core FFO per share is expected to be between $1.23 and $1.35 per share for the first 3 quarters of '15, and $1.28 to $1.40 per share for the fourth quarter. The primary driver of 2015 performance is expected to be same-store NOI growth, which is projected to be 3% to 4% based on a 3% to 4% growth in both revenues and operating expenses. We expect operating expenses to continue to have some pressure from real estate taxes, which are projected to grow between 4.5% to 5.5% for 2015. We plan a significant amount of transaction activity in 2015, as we recycle older assets and continue to dispose of commercial and land assets acquired from Colonial. We plan to sell 300 to 350 of multi-family communities in 2015 and an additional $50 million to $75 million of commercial and land assets. We expect to reinvest these proceeds and/or excess cash generated from operations into $400 million to $500 million of new multi-family assets. We also expect to begin a limited number of development projects during the year, consisting of Phase II expansion opportunities at 2 of our existing properties. And we also anticipate that we'll identify one additional opportunity on a prepurchase basis of a new development project during the year. Given the interest-rate environment and high demand for apartment assets in the current market, we believe the majority of the property sales will occur early in the year, and we're projecting about $250 million sales in the first quarter and the remainder $150 million or so in the second quarter. We project about $90 million of new acquisitions in the first quarter, really representing one deal that's already closed in January, and one additional deal currently well into the contract process. Other than these, we expect the remainder of the acquisitions to occur over the back half of the year as transaction volume continues to grow and opportunities expand, which is reflected in our 2015 guidance. We expect dilution during 2015 from both the initial loss of NOI yield or spread from selling older assets and buying new, as well as from the timing of the reinvestment, and as outlined in our earnings release, our current projections for 2015 includes dilution-related recycling plans as well as the new development projects mentioned earlier. Keep in mind that on an after-CapEx basis or cash flow basis, the dilution from this recycling is much smaller, as the initial spread between the older, higher capital needs assets we are selling is much closer to the yield on newer assets being purchased -- only about 25 basis to 50 basis points spread. Other key assumptions in 2015 include plans to refinance about $400 million of debt maturities in the fourth quarter and combined G&A and property management expenses for 2015 of $56.5 million to $58.5 million, reflecting the full synergy capture forecasted from the merger. Our current plans do not include the need for any new equity during 2015, and we expect to end the year with leverage defined as net debt to gross assets of 40% to 42% or 1% to 2% below our current leverage level, which is a very strong position given our lower risk or limited development strategy. That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments, Steve, and so now we'll turn the call back over to you for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: So can you break down the disposition-related dilution, the $0.19? You said, it's kind of a combination of timing and cap rate. When you look at the multi-family amount that you're selling, the $300 million to $350 million, how does those cap rates compare to new? Is that the 100 basis points or are you taking into account the commercial as well that you can see that spread?
H. Eric Bolton: I think, that spread is everything included, but primarily multi-family is driving that, Rich. And these assets, they're pretty close. So let me break that down for you. $0.19 that we outlined in the press release is made up of $0.16 from this recycling effort and $0.03 from development. So just putting development, and development's just carrying that capital during the year on the new projects that we talked about without having the earnings yet. The $0.16 is really $0.10 per share from the NOI spread loss, both the multi-family and the development that we will have. We're selling assets that are older, higher CapEx needs that have about a 8% NOI yield. We're buying assets that have a 5% to 5.5% NOI yield, so that's a 200 to 250 basis points spread. But let me point out, that's on an NOI business. When you look after CapEx, as we talked about, these are -- these older properties are 1,000 to 1,300 unit on CapEx, and so that makes that spread, call 25 to 50 basis points, much tighter. But we're showing the impact on FFO in this, so $0.10 from that and then $0.06 really from just timing of these transactions -- selling the assets, we talked about having activity early in the year and really reinvesting over the back half of the year, so hopefully that gives you your...
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Okay. So but you're selling multi-family assets at an 8 cap -- NOI cap?
H. Eric Bolton: NOI yields, an NOI yield, that's before any CapEx. So that's...
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: I got you. I got you. I understand, but it's still a pretty big number. Okay. And what about the commercial stuff. You think, looking at -- those are -- it seems like $50 million to $75 million is just basically all of it?
Albert M. Campbell: We had a little bit of all of it, it's all the operating assets. We have one joint venture. We still have -- it's very, very minor left, $250,000 or so. But, yes, essentially all the operating commercial assets will be sold here in the first quarter.
H. Eric Bolton: We just have land left.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, when you look further out, not that I'm asking for 2016 guidance, but when you look further out, I mean, do you think that this is the last kind of year of this significant recycling downside to your numbers, are you kind of cleaning house of at this point? Or do you think, you will be a net seller for many years to come as long as cap rates stay where they are at.
Albert M. Campbell: No. I'll tell you, Rich, I mean, we see a window of opportunity right now to harvest capital out of a lot of older assets that we've owned for a long time that we feel offers a great value opportunity. So we're going to -- we're jumping on that opportunity. And we're going to move on it pretty aggressively early in the year. I think that, ultimately we're not interested in trying to overhaul the portfolio. There is not some sort of major transformation going on here. We still feel very much committed to our bifurcation between large and secondary markets. It's really just harvesting out of some smaller assets and the window of opportunity right now is very strong. So we're looking effectively to match-fund acquisitions with this effort. And we'll see how the market conditions continue to hold up. But if the market conditions continue to support an opportunity to pull capital out of assets that we feel like the after CapEx performance is going to -- over the next 10 years, not be as robust as alternatives we can find in some newer assets then we will continue at a pretty good clip, but it all -- it's a tough time to be a buyer as you know. And of course, relate -- this late in the cycle, frankly, piling a bunch of money into development is not something that's real high interest to us as well. So we'll just see how the reinvestment opportunities pan out. We're optimistic that we'll get it done. And -- but to suggest that we've got some sort of major overhaul, a major recycling that we're going to be doing for quite some time, I think is an overstatement.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: So would you -- how much of the $300 million to $350 million is legacy MAA assets?
Albert M. Campbell: About 99%.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Is that right, okay. Interesting. You mentioned -- you just used the term late in the cycle, what do you mean by that?
Albert M. Campbell: Well, I think that we're at a point where a lot of supply is coming into the market and developers are pretty active. And I mean -- at this point, I mean the demand side of the equation supports it, but as we know, I mean this business, I still fundamentally believe has a cyclicality to it that we have to be mindful of, and we've been in a very healthy period for some time. And so I would argue that, that we're on the peak or the back end of the cycle to some degree. And I think that it's hard to see anything that's going to completely weaken anything materially in the near term, but I do believe that given the level of new supply coming into the market, that us ramping up a big development operation is certainly not the thing to do. And I'd rather just be an opportunistic buyer of this product coming into the market.
Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, just lastly, what do you do -- you said above trend rent growth, what do you define as trend?
Albert M. Campbell: Rich, we'll answer this, and then we're going to jump to another question. But I would tell you that trend for us is going to be at right around 3%, and -- so I think we'll be a little bit better than that.
Operator: Our next question is from Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I guess, Eric, I just wanted to go back to that comment you just made about where you think we are in the cycle. I wanted to probe to see if you feel that way about the secondary markets. They haven't participated in job growth, they didn't grow as much as the bigger markets did last year, and there was a really nice pickup here in the fourth quarter? So would you clarify those comments just to say -- do you feel differently about the secondary markets in those terms?
H. Eric Bolton: That's a good point, Karin. I do feel differently about it for a lot of reasons you just mentioned. I do think that these secondary markets have clearly not seen the level of robust job growth, and they're clearly not seeing the level of new supply. And this is why we have them in the portfolio, because we do believe that as conditions eventually moderate in some fashion that these markets tend to not move off this sort of steady-state level as much as you sometimes see in the larger markets. And just to clarify sort of the comment, I don't anticipate, by any means, that we're going to see any material deterioration or any sort of material weakening beginning to take place in the apartment real estate fundamentals. I mean, we've got too many favorable sort of macro variables, demographics and all the things that everybody knows about -- attitude towards home ownership and all those other factors that are really going to, I think, propel a very strong demand side performance for some time. But I do believe that just as a consequence of the sector continuing to attract a lot of interest and capital, supply is going to continue to pick up, and the job growth improvement trends will begin to moderate at some level. I mean, we're not going to go to 3% unemployment, and so there will be some level of moderation that will eventually take place. So I think that over the next couple of years, it's hard to see anything absent of recession or absent some sort of cataclysmic event elsewhere that really causes the economy to retract in a meaningful way. It's hard to see anything causing a significant weakening in apartment fundamentals over the next 2 or more years.
Albert M. Campbell: And then, Karin, on the secondary markets, jobs to completions improves to about 13, and we see job growth really is the key factor in these markets driving it. It will move from 14 and 16 [ph] to 2015 at 25. And we've certainly been happy with the performance of Charleston, Greenville and Savannah. It's just a matter of getting a few others some job growth and getting them off the mark.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Thanks for the color.That's helpful. My second question is just on revenue growth for 2015. Can you talk about what revenue growth you've already earned into the rent roll? And what type of ability you've seen to push rents here early in the year in 2015, just what the post quarter trends have been? And have you seen any impact in your tenancy with the decline in gas prices?
Albert M. Campbell: Karin, this is Al. I'll cover the first part and let Tom cover the second portion of that. But if you look at our overall portfolio and our forecast, we think we have about 2% sort of baked in or earned in based on the contracts we have in place and the current pricing of the marketplace. So we feel good about our projections for the year, and that's pretty strong. And then on top of that, we expect to get -- to get to our mid-point of our guidance, we'd need similar pricing over the remainder of the year and capturing that back half. And I'll let Tom...
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes. And Karin, blended rates for January on a year-over-year basis were 4.4%. That's up 63 basis points from January of last year and exposure's about 50 basis points lower. We're seeing higher traffic as well, so very encouraging trends as we move into January.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And -- or do you think gas prices have -- had any impact yet?
Thomas L. Grimes: Karin, I think that everybody is enjoying having a little bit more money in their pocket as a result of that. And we believe that, that will benefit for us down the road. Our rent to income ratio is very low at 16%; this just helps this. Does it make a difference today in our sort of lower demand part of the cycle? I don't think so. But it will have a compounding effect as we get into the year.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just one last quick one. Can you just tell us what the accretion was from the development that you completed in 2014 and 2015?
Albert M. Campbell: When we -- you mean in terms of how much is contributing to the forecast or the guidance in '15 overall?
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Correct, yes.
Albert M. Campbell: Yes. I'll just break that down real quick. I guess the main components driving our earnings, are same-store portfolio, which is adding about $0.23 per share from the midpoint of our growth. Then there's about $0.15 to $0.18 per share that's going to be added from our non same-store portfolio, which includes recently acquired deals, this development, which is a big part of it is the development coming to fruition, Karin, you're talking about, and those things all coming together about $0.15 to $0.18. And then obviously, you got this $0.16 per share from recycling offsetting that to get you down to our change for the year.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. So large chunk of that, $0.15 to $0.18 is development. Okay.
Albert M. Campbell: Yes, obviously we have 5 deals undergoing at the end of last year, or 4 -- excuse me, and a large part of that is productive this year.
Operator: And our next question is from Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So quick question on your same-store revenue guidance. I just want to make sure I understand this correctly. The current same-store revenue out that you have does not contemplate the dispositions in it, is that right?
Albert M. Campbell: The dispositions -- our portfolio has been pulled out of our same-store, Haendel, because we -- when we target them, we pull them out so that we can have a consistent same-store portfolio throughout the year. So yes, it does not include that.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got you. Okay. And then, curious on -- you haven't given, I don't think, new versus renewal trend specifically for 4Q and January? And what you're asking for in February, March?
Albert M. Campbell: Yes. Sure. On a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter, new leases were up 4%, which is about 40 basis points higher than prior year. Renewals were up 5% for a blended of 4.7%. Going -- looking forward on renewals, January, we asked for about 8%, we got 7.3%; for February, we asked for about 8% again and got 7.1%. And then, in March, it was 6.5%.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got you. And a couple of quick follow-ups. I guess, your thoughts on Houston from an investment perspective. I heard the other day from a peer of yours, looking opportunistically for development opportunities there. Just curious on your thoughts there in terms of acquisitions, potential dispositions given what could present some -- the dislocation -- expected dislocation that could present some opportunities in Houston over the course of this year and early next year?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, Haendel, this is Eric. We like Houston long term. We think there are going to be some good opportunities emerge over the course of this next year. And we're going to continue to be active in the market looking for opportunities. I absolutely agree with the point.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And what was the move-out of the home buying during the quarter?
H. Eric Bolton: It was down from 21 to 20, Haendel, I believe. Yes, 21 to 20, down 4.5%.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. I'm just curious, Eric. As you sort of look ahead, we've heard from some of the builders here that they're feeling a bit more bold up [ph] it sounds -- starts estimates are up 20 percentage year-over-year, credit is slightly improving. It's certainly painting the picture for a slightly more competitive headwinds from the for sale markets and given your footprint and a lot of where the builders are expected to build, just curious on what your thoughts are for that competitive dynamic as we roll through this year into next year?
H. Eric Bolton: I'm sorry what -- and that was the competitive dynamic associated with apartments or...
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: The fit for sale single-family?
H. Eric Bolton: Single-family, I'm sorry. Okay. Haendel, we continue to not to be worried about mounting pressure from single-family. I think that -- yes, that, I mean, you know all the dynamics surrounding people's attitude and people putting those decisions off later and all the sort of issues that go with that. I mean, we continue to believe that, ultimately a strong single-family housing market ultimately is a good thing for the economy and ultimately is a good thing for the apartment business. I think the job creations that come out of that, particularly in this region of the country, tend to drive positive things for the economy, the trickledown effect of a healthy housing environment has -- continues to -- we think ultimately create positive implications for demand for apartment housing. And to give you just a perspective on that, I mean, if you go back to sort of the 2006, 2007 time frame, where arguably the single-family housing market was at a fairly robust level, we were generating some of the strongest rent growth we've ever generated in our 21-year history with rents on average year-over-year going up 5%-or-so. So we think that a vibrant housing market is a good thing.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I appreciate that. I was just sort of looking back through my notes here. It looks like the move out of for home buying you said this quarter were -- you said were down to about 20%, is that -- if I heard it correctly?
Albert M. Campbell: That's right.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: It looks like over the course of last year that was more in the low-to-mid teens?
H. Eric Bolton: I mean, last year it was 20%. It was -- 1,842 moved out for home buying versus 1,759. Now, Haendel, it will change by quarter. So, it's a little higher actually in the fourth quarter I think than it was in the second, as people who are trying to get into houses right at the end of the year due to their closings. But the trend for the year and the trend for the quarter is down.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I'll stick to the 2 questions here. Just first question in terms of your assumptions for 2015 for revenues, what is the breakout between primary and secondary markets, so if you look at the 3% to 4%, what would you expect for the primary versus secondary? And also in terms of rank, what would you assume in those?
H. Eric Bolton: I think, probably on a rounded basis from the primary, probably 4%, and the secondary, closer to 3%. And so, that gives you the 100 or maybe a little over, spread between -- through the year, so that's the assumptions in general that we put in, Mike.
Albert M. Campbell: And the bulk of -- and the revenue growth will largely come strictly from rent growth.
H. Eric Bolton: Yes, pricing is...
Albert M. Campbell: We plan to hold occupancy fairly consistent.
H. Eric Bolton: Actually, I give a little -- we plan to give a little bit occupancy back about -- only about 10 basis points, because we do expect turnover to increase just a little bit with the job market, Mike, but in general, it's pricing this year.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. Second question. Eric, it was a bit of a surprise to see the big pickup there in the acquisition forecast, just given the aggressive pricing we're seeing both -- even in the Sunbelt [indiscernible] right now. Can you just give us a little color where you're sourcing that? Have acquisition cap rates or IRR targets changed at all? Or is your growth forecast increased enough to offset that?
H. Eric Bolton: No. I mean, cap rates haven't really moved, Mike. It just continues to be a consequence of -- frankly, we're seeing more activity just as more of this new construction comes on line, developers are increasingly -- we're finding anxious to pull their money out of the deals that they've either just started or just started leasing. And they want to pull the money out and get -- and start another project as soon as they possibly can. So I think just as a consequence of not wanting to miss out on this window of opportunity for the next 2 to 3 years of what is expected to be very good leasing fundamentals and a good time to -- as a developer arguably to try to bring something online. We're just seeing a lot more transaction volume; it's starting to really pick up. It hasn't really manifested itself in any way that we've seen in increasing cap rates. There is still a lot of cap out there. But just as a consequence of the volume and then as I said just given our focus on these markets now for as long as we've been in, and I mean, we're seeing a lot of deals that are on an off market basis, deals that had fallen out of contract. I mean, a number of these deals that we just closed on, had all been on a contract previously. And we had been tracking the process and they came back around; for whatever reason the deals fell out. So it's really just a volume-related sort of thing that we see creating -- growing opportunity and that's what's really driving it.
Operator: And our next question is from Buck Horne from Raymond James.
Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to go back to the question about Texas, maybe just a little bit more broadly in your thoughts about future investment allocations to the entire state, just given the overall energy outlook with Mid-America's exposure being a little bit elevated. How do you think about not only just Houston, but Fort Worth, Dallas, Austin? Have you seen any signs yet of rising turnover or bad debt in any of those Texas markets' job turmoil?
H. Eric Bolton: Buck, I would say just quickly, no, we haven't seen anything in our numbers from a bad debt or rent trends or anything that would suggest any weakness at this point. But broadly speaking, I mean, we continue to feel very good about the Texas markets overall. Houston being only 3% of our NOI, we feel like that we've got room to expand our presence in Houston frankly and not really create too much of a concentration risk broadly speaking for the portfolio overall, and to give you a perspective on this, just -- where we're surrounding oil pricing and any particular weakness coming out of Houston, if we saw, as an example, instead of 3% NOI growth out of Houston, if we saw 0% NOI growth out of Houston in our portfolio, the impact for us over the course of a year will be less than a $0.01 a share for FFO. So it's just not a worry for us generally on this question surrounding Houston and oil pricing and so on and so forth. But having said that, I mean, we continue to believe the Texas economy, just the pro-business environment there, great quality of life, great standard of living, low cost of living, lack of state income tax and the way that, that economy continues to track businesses out of the Northeast, off the West Coast is going to continue to cause Dallas and Austin, San Antonio and Houston continue to be a very prosperous place to do business. And now having said that, I mean, our current investment allocation from a portfolio perspective to both Dallas and Fort Worth and Austin are -- is fairly full. You're not going to see us grow our presence much in those 3 markets from where we are today, and we will be doing some recycling I'm sure over the next several years. But in terms of growing our presence given our current size, we'll likely -- unlikely to grow a lot more there. Houston's a market where we feel like we do have some growth capacity and same with San Antonio.
Albert M. Campbell: And Buck, just some local coverage in Houston. Of our properties there, we only have one in the energy corridor. It has about 25% exposure of employment to oil and gas. On the economy front, job transfers are up, which we view as a healthy reason, up 9. They've lost 1 job in the last 60 days and delinquencies improved by 10 basis points. So -- and frankly pretty healthy fundamentals, if you didn't read the press and you just looked at the numbers, we -- Houston looks pretty good.
Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: That's a very helpful answer, very thorough. A quick follow-up, though. Given your earlier comments about you are seeing developers get a little bit more aggressive, supply is certainly ramping particularly in some of the primary markets, I'm kind of thinking of places like Austin and Charlotte as well, would you look to potentially downsize or reallocate capital away from markets that you think may have excess supply pressure over the next couple of years? Would you reduce your exposure to some of these primary markets in advance of some of that supply delivery?
H. Eric Bolton: Yes. I would tell you, Buck, that we'd be unlikely to move a bunch of capital out of a given market, because what we worry regarding a 2-year window, where supply may be a little bit excessive. I mean, when we buy these assets and deploy this capital, I mean, it's sort of a full cycle mindset that we go in with. And so, I think that what we typically do when you see markets get a little bit sort of out of balance, it's a time to think hard about any sort of fine-tuning that you want to do from a recycling effort as a result of rotating out of some older assets and the newer assets or things of that nature. But sort of wholesale changes to market mix and market allocation as a consequence of periodic supply issues is not something that we think we should be doing.
Operator: Our next question is from Dave Bragg from Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Eric, can you please elaborate on your statement that you'd look for opportunities in Houston. How are you adjusting your underwriting? And what change in values or cap rates do you have to see to account for lower growth prospects in that market?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, Well, I think, obviously we would be pretty cautious right now in terms of rent growth outlook for the next couple of years or so. I mean, the deal that we closed on in November, this was located in Northwest Houston. It's exactly adjacent to the new Hewlett-Packard Campus that employs 10,000 people. It's half -- less than half a mile from Houston's Northwest Medical Center and Saint Luke's Hospital. And so we feel good, but given Houston and the concerns that we all know about, I mean, I think we assume 2.5% rent growth the first year and pretty modest for some time. I think that when -- I think we have to see how this plays out, Dave, to understand the likely -- how bad it gets or how we can may -- it may become. I believe that it's probably likely that this doesn't persist much more than a couple of years, and I don't think we can get back to $100 oil, but I don't think we stay at $40 either. So -- and of course, the Houston economy has continued to diversify itself a little bit over the last 10 years or so, and we think that between the healthcare industry and logistics and shipping and the port activity, that Houston has got a vibrant-enough economic base, absent oil and gas, that it's not going to just be anywhere close to sort of the same level of pressures that you see in a market like Washington, that is so influenced by federal employment levels and federal government trends, I think Houston has got a little bit more of a diversification to it. And so I think that this is possibly a good time to buy. But at this point, I can tell you that some of the things we've been looking at, we haven't seen any worry come into the pricing yet, and we may not be able to buy down there, given the continued healthy appetite that capital has for multi-family in general including in Houston, so it's just a -- it will continue to be a wait and see. And obviously, if we close any deals this year, we'll be glad to talk to you about it.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Second question relates to the possibility of being an opportunistic buyer. You've spoken about that in the past, given that potential for overbuilding in some of your markets. Should we see a material change in asset values, both in the private market and the public market, could you talk about how well positioned you believe the balance sheet is or will be to allow you to take advantage of those opportunities?
Albert M. Campbell: Yes. I mean, Dave. This is Al. We certainly feel that our balance sheet is in very good shape to take advantage of opportunities. And I'd point back to a recent time in history in 2009, '10 when it happened, we certainly didn't have nearly as strong a position or balance sheet and took great opportunity of it then. We think we're much better prepared today. And if those opportunities come forth, I mean, we have plenty of capacity, great relationships across the debt spectrum and we've worked hard on our equity programs, have ATM in place, have issued equity under overnights' prepurchase deals, all kinds of tools or methods in place. So we feel very good about our ability to raise capital to do that, and we'll certainly opportunistically be in a position...
H. Eric Bolton: And Dave, I will add. I mean, we're generating more free cash flow, if you will, than we ever have as a company, and we're selling more assets than we've ever sold as a company. So I mean, if we do a $400 million to $500 million acquisition volume year -- this year, which is the most we've ever bought in a given year, and we're doing it without issuing a $1 of equity, I think it gives you some sense of our capacity to handle opportunity.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And last question relates to the potential opportunity on the revenue side from lower gas prices. What are the strategic conversations like internally? Is this something that you just watch happen and you feel as though you'll reap the benefits or do you think that you can adjust yield star and push more aggressively on renewals than you would add $100 oil and capture a benefit proactively quicker?
H. Eric Bolton: And we are -- David, what we're doing is watching demand over the sensors and then maximizing that. So we feel comfortable that if there is the ability to push rents, our system and our approach to the system, it's not just the system, but it's the way you monitor it, would allow us to maximize that as it happened, if that make sense. In other words, we don't dial it in for macro changes in the marketplace, but we are accurate enough to exploit those when they occur.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: And your portfolio is one of the most suburban portfolios of the apartment REITs, and with gas prices already down significantly, are you pushing harder on renewals today than you would have at $100 oil?
H. Eric Bolton: Dave, renewals went out at 8%, that is aggressive and that was -- that we feel like is what the market will bear. We are not adjusting ours for $100. We are adjusting it for how many people are moving out, how many people are looking. And we would expect resident quality to improve, we would expect delinquency to improve. But our residents aren't really folks that are right living on the edge, it's a matter of seeing the opportunity and exploiting the opportunity.
Albert M. Campbell: And the 2 metrics that we've monitored probably more than anything else about, are we pushing hard enough or not too hard, is really move-outs due to rent increase, and then, of course, the rent to income ratio in the portfolio. And both of those metrics are very supportive of being pretty aggressive right now on rents. And as Tom says, that's exactly what we're doing.
Thomas L. Grimes: And we're also monitoring take rates and conversion rates. And if those go up, our price goes up. And if those goes down, our price goes down. Or we figure out is there a non-price reason for that and we attack our operation and refine it from there.
Operator: Our next question is from Tom Lesnick from Capital One.
Thomas James Lesnick - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division: I know you guys already talked about move-outs to purchase home already, but obviously, not everyone is in a position to buy a home. So I'm just kind of curious what percentage of your tenant base rents by choice and what percent of your tenant base, whether it be by savings, income or credit, really has no choice but to rent, and how has that trended over the last, call it, few quarters?
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes. I won't be able to answer that directly. I would tell you 100% of our residents rent by choice, because they probably have other options available to them. With a rent to income ratio of 16, that's improved; at sort of the bottom of the cycle, that was as high as 20. And if you figure that, a bank is going to want what 25% down or the ability -- not 25% down, but the ability to -- the PNI is less than 20% to 25%, we feel like you've got a huge chunk of those renters who are choosing that option. I think it's more a lifestyle choice honestly, Tom, than I think it is an affordability choice. I think with a booming economy, there are folks who are interested in being close to jobs and close to good retail centers and value the flexibility of a lease and the services that our teams provide.
Thomas James Lesnick - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division: All right. Great. And I guess, shifting back to large versus secondary markets, I know you talked about limited supply and some of the secondary markets being later to the recovery. I'm just kind of curious to what extent income growth is limiting growth in those markets? And I guess, how the rent to income ratio differs between some of your larger markets and secondary markets?
H. Eric Bolton: Yes. And I don't have it for this quarter, but historically, affordability has actually been a little better in the secondary markets.
Operator: Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Just a couple from us. Gentlemen, you did mention again in the new supply kind of starting to come online in some of your markets, can you just kind of identify the markets where you are most concerned about new supply?
H. Eric Bolton: Sure, Tayo. And I think it's more kind of an improving situation, where we're still monitoring Raleigh, which is 7:1. It is -- it's working its way out with stronger job growth. And Austin is worth monitoring as well at 5:1, but again it's been very resilient and largely our properties, which are more suburban in Austin, have not borne the brunt of the central core area. And then in Dallas, we have light exposure to the uptown with 1 property and 2 properties in Las Colinas, which you're seeing a little supply [ph] .
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then from an acquisition perspective, with the Gables transaction now done, are there any other kind of fairly large portfolios out there that kind of would fit thematically what MAA would be interested in buying?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, yes, there are a few opportunities that bounce around from time-to-time, and as we usually take a hard look at them. But I will tell you that in most cases, there's usually 2 issues that we find tough to get over. One is usually there is some asset quality in that portfolio that is -- that would be really a step back for us, that we find is not really worth the effort to try to bring in the portfolio and then turn it all around and then try to sell it. So usually there's asset quality issues. And then secondly, often, particularly in these private funds or private portfolios, usually have in-place financing that is not as attractive as the financing that we're able to put on and you usually have to bring the debt with it. And so ultimately, it creates an opportunity that is not as attractive as the opportunities that we're finding focused on fairly new product, fairly recently built, new or to-be-built product that we can come in and put the right debt structure on -- right financing structure that really keeps our balance sheet where we need to keep it, and really, we think materially more so improves long-term asset quality. So we'll continue to look at them, but we generally find there's usually something about it that is as not particularly as attractive as what we're doing otherwise.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Got it. And then just one more from me in regards to the Colonial portfolio. Just at this point, is there still any additional synergies you expected to kind of get out of that portfolio or it's been optimized at this point?
Albert M. Campbell: I'll just say, Tayo, if you think -- look at our guidance for the current year or for 2014 and our performance, we captured a lot of those synergies in the back half, third and fourth quarter particularly on the expense, so I think on a quarterly run rate, we feel like the expenses are pretty fully captured. There is a little bit of revenue left to capture, and I'd say we'll feel a little bit in the first and second quarters of next year, probably 2/3 out of the 3 quarters and all that opportunity has been captured on a run rate basis in Q4 though.
Albert M. Campbell: And I would also tell you, though, we've talked about having 15,000 to 20,000 units of redevelopment opportunity in the portfolio. The lion's share of that is the Legacy-Colonial asset base, and that's something that we'll be doing over 4,000 units this year, so that's something that we think over the next 2 to 3 years that we'll continue to capture in the way of a sort of opportunity out of this merger. Frankly, it's a bigger opportunity than what we initially thought it was when we went into the merger. So we -- as Al said, a lot of it has been sort of captured and we've sort of permanently, if you will, improved margins as a consequence of that. We do think as we get towards the latter part of this year, we'll start to sort of normalize, if you will, and some of that lift out of the merger starts to dissipate just as a consequence of year-over-year comparisons, but the redevelopment component will continue for some time.
Operator: Our next question is from Dan Oppenheim from Zelman & Associates.
Dan Oppenheim: I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the -- those revenue expectations for 2015 again. You talked a lot about the expectation for some better results from the secondary markets. Do you think that -- how comparable do you think you will end up seeing the revenue growth in terms of the large versus secondary markets in 2015? And given your comments about the cycle, do you think we'll see a sort of switching point in terms of better performance from secondary?
Albert M. Campbell: Well, I'll answer the first part and probably Eric will answer some of the cycle comments, but just in terms of what is in our forecast and expectations for 2015, we're calling for something like 4% revenue growth, maybe a little bit higher from the large markets and around 3% for the secondary markets blending to our average for the year at midpoint of 3.5% in our range.
H. Eric Bolton: And I would tell you that as the cycle continues to mature, we typically do see the performance delta between the large and secondary market start to close a little bit, as a consequence of supply pressure picking up more actively in the larger markets versus the secondary markets. And then also typically the secondary markets are a little later in the recovery in terms of the job growth front. So we do believe that if you want to assume and contemplate sort of a flattening or a moderation at some level, we typically see the performance delta between the 2 segments start to flatten out. Now to really get into a situation like we had back in 2008, 2009 time frame, where our secondary markets were actually outperforming our larger markets, you have to get really much more into a severe sort of recessionary-type environment, because in those kind of situations, the large markets really get hit pretty hard as a consequence of more severe job loss and then more often than not, those markets have also been oversupplied relative to that. [Audio gap]
Dan Oppenheim: Got it. And then, on acquisitions, your recent acquisitions there in Atlanta [Audio gap] or do you think about given that there will be some of the legacy MMA assets likely in some of the secondary markets, would you think about sort of keeping the balance in terms of the weightings of large and secondary?
H. Eric Bolton: Yes. We absolutely are committed to staying broadly sort of balance 60% weighting of the portfolio in the larger markets and about 40% in the secondary markets. What you're seeing us do is technically pull out some older assets, where we feel like the after CapEx yields are likely to begin to show more severe moderation than what we would be able to achieve with some newer investment. As it so happens, given the history of our company, a lot of the older assets that we own are in some of the more tertiary markets of the Secondary Market segment of the portfolio, and thus, that's where the focus is at this moment in terms of harvesting capital out of these investments. But we will be absolutely committed to redeploying in the larger markets as well as secondary markets as we go forward. Unlikely we'll do tertiary markets, but I mean we will [Audio gap] We feel very committed to keeping a presence in those markets.
Operator: Our next question is Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird.
Drew Babin: I was hoping if you could talk about the range of move out to buy ratios within the portfolio, sort of what markets you're seeing rent versus average cost of owning per month parity, where moving into a house is more just a financial decision versus markets where it's more of a lifestyle choice that involves commuting, things like that?
H. Eric Bolton: Yes. I would tell you, Drew, it really -- it appears to be -- to us less about that and more about vibrancy of the economy. Where we see home buying the highest is where we see job growth the highest. And where we see home buying the lowest is usually where job growth is the lowest.
Drew Babin: Okay. And one follow-up on the balance sheet. In terms of refinancing your 2015 debt maturities, there's certainly -- it's a lower number than we saw at this time last year. Will you be -- is the plan to kind of do all that in one larger unsecured bond or are there other sort of unsecured debt options that you're looking at vis-a-vis term loans, things like that?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, we certainly have a lot of -- the full slate of options available to us, Drew, but I think most of that debt matures in a fairly tight grooving, the end of the third quarter. So we have about $370 million maturing. We're going to pre-pay a couple of more loans. So probably, in terms of placeholder [ph] expect us to be looking for about $400 million to $450 million of financing, I think, likely best option at this point is a public bond, a 10-year deal in that range, which if we did that today, it's probably, call it 3.3% to 3.5%, on a 10-year basis, something in that range.
Operator: Our next question is from Carol Kemple from Hilliard Lyons.
Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division: I just have a couple of questions on the developments. Earlier you talked about 2 properties where you expect to do some Phase II expansions at. When do you expect to break ground on those?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, we have just broken ground on one of them. And the other one would be later this year, probably third, fourth quarter of this year.
Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division: Okay. And then, you talked about buying one property that was probably still in development. Do you -- have you identified that property at this point?
Albert M. Campbell: No, we have not.
Operator: Our next question is from Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just one quick follow-up. What do you think the growth differential is going to be between the assets that you're going to sell this year and the assets you're going to buy?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, I think, as part of that NOI yield spread, I think is the answer to that question, Karin. And I think we're going to sell assets, though they have a high NOI yield now, they're probably expected to grow over the next couple of years between 0 and 2%, and what we're buying is we're expecting to grow probably 4% on average.
Operator: Next, we have a follow-up question from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Just a follow-on along the same line as that Karin was asking. You mentioned earlier on that in regards to where we are in the cycle, the secondary or tertiary markets still feel like they're earlier in the cycle, they haven't kind of gotten the same kind of improvements that your primary markets have. But yet when you take a look at your acquisition and disposition activity, it's the stuff in the secondary markets that's being sold, when they are probably at the earlier -- or where hopefully they're about to just kind of go through the same kind of market improvement that the primary markets have gone through over the past few years? So I'm just kind of -- if you could just reconcile those 2 things for me, or why sell secondary when they haven't received the same boom that the primaries have and they should as the economy improves?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, because it's an optimum time to maximize sort of value capture out of -- pulling out of those markets, frankly in the sense that -- on the financing front. I mean, we're getting decent, if you will, NOI growth. I understand the point you're making that maybe next year or the year after is slightly better, but arguably, I would tell you that the financing environment that supports the capability to exit the investments on an attractive basis is better now than I've ever seen it. And I think that in an effort to sort of really harvest the best IRR and the best return on capital and create the most value for that capital, we think better to trade off a little current earning, if you will, in order to pull the capital out and get it redeployed into an investment that we think long term is going to likely create a better yield and a higher yield and a better return on capital. So it really is -- I understand the point you're making, but conceding, if you will, $0.19 of earnings this year is not something that we take lightly, but we think it's the right thing to be doing for value creation long term.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.
H. Eric Bolton: No closing comments here. If you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss, feel free to contact us anytime. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-11-01 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Tim Argo - SVP, Director-Finance H. Eric Bolton Jr. - Chairman and CEO Albert Campbell III - EVP and CFO Thomas Grimes Jr. - EVP and COO
Analysts: David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley Paula Poskon - D.A.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for participating in the MAA Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tim Argo, SVP of Finance. You may begin.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Priscilla. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-Act filings with SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning’s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks, Tim and Good morning everyone. Operating results for the third quarter were in line with our expectations and reflect continued strong leasing demand across the portfolio. In addition, with our merger integration process now largely complete, results are beginning to reflect the benefits of enhanced execution on the legacy Colonial portfolio as well as the benefits of increased scale impacting the combined portfolio. For the quarter, pro forma same store revenues increased 3.6% as compared to prior year and effective rent growth was 3.2%. Encouragingly, when considering just the leases written during the third quarter, pricing was on average 4.8% higher as compared to the prior year, well ahead of the cumulative rent growth on all the in-place leases during the quarter. Occupancy remained strong with quarter and fiscal occupancy for the entire portfolio at 96.3%, putting us in a good position for the traditionally slower leasing activity during the winter months. Resident turnover continues to run below long-term average, with move-outs during the third quarter down 7% on a pro forma same-store basis when compared to prior year. Move-outs to home buying declined a significant 14% when compared to the third quarter of last year. Our new supply continues to come online in a number of markets, job growth across most markets has been sufficiently strong to support positive absorption and solid rent growth. While there are going to be pockets of extra supply relative to demand in some sub market, I expect this to continue to be the exception and not a widespread concern. As the economy continues to show slow recovery and new construction activity picks up, we believe these trends will be positive for job growth and demand for rental housing, construction and construction related industries including single family construction and an improving housing market have typically been a boost to the economy in the Sunbelt markets. One of our best years of rent growth in our 20-year history was in 2007 when the single family housing market was at a very robust level. Absent a slip in the recovery of the job markets, we expect continued solid leasing fundamentals and rent growth into next year. As mentioned third quarter results reflect the growing impact of the merger opportunities we have previously discussed. After closing the merger on October 1 of last year, we began executing a number of changes to on site practices and policies within the legacy Colonial portfolio. Most of these changes required the re-working and consolidation of various systems and software conversions, while some changes were a matter of re-training our associates and retooling a number of operating processes. It can take two to three quarter for the impact of these sorts of changes to show up in reported result. Comparing the legacy Colonial performance same-store portfolio on a year-over-year, during the third quarter, we improved the NOI operating margin on these properties by 250 basis points. Changes made range from how we execute with our revenue management system and establishing pricing targets and exposure tolerances to how we approach property staffing and unit turn activities. In addition to the operating upside within the legacy Colonial portfolio, our merger transaction also created a number of benefits resulting from expanded platform size and scale. This of course benefits both the legacy Colonial portfolio as well as the legacy MAA portfolio. When comparing the NOI margins for the same-store legacy MAA portfolio for the third quarter on a year-over-year basis we captured a 130 basis point improvement in performance. We've reworked a number of national contracts for various products and services earlier this year and those renegotiated pricing terms have began to more actively work their way through our operation and have a positive compounding effect on results through the busy summer leasing season. As we continue to harvest these opportunities as well as execute on the redevelopment opportunity within the legacy Colonial portfolio, we continue to feel good about capturing the upside in NOI operating synergies as well as the G&A synergies that we've previously identified in our merger transaction. As outlined in the earnings release, we remain very busy on the transaction front. We've completed our planned apartment property sales for the year and are substantially through the disposition of the commercial properties that were acquired as part of our merger. You will note that we've increased our guidance for the year surrounding acquisitions as we have a number of properties currently under contract to buy and expect to close most of these by yearend. As new development activity has picked up in a number of markets, we've see a noticeable increase in deals being brought to market and are encouraged this pattern will continue into next year. This should support our efforts to continue with an active program of capital recycle. In total at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect to sell just over $300 million of properties this year and expect a similar volume of activity in 2015. We also continue to make good progress leasing our existing new development and lease-up pipeline and expect to have full productivity of most of these deals in 2015. We're currently negotiating a couple of additional pre-purchase opportunities and would expect to reload our development pipeline although at a reduced level over the next few months as another source of opportunity for recycling capital. That’s all the way I have in the way of opening comment. I am going to turn the call over to Al.
Albert Campbell III: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I’ll provide some additional commentary on the company’s third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally on updated earnings guidance for the year. FFO for the quarter was $103.8 million or $1.31 per share. Core FFO, which excludes certain items, primarily merger and integration cost and market value adjustment for debt assumed and debt extinguishment cost was $101.6 million or $1.28 per share, which was $0.07 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. The results were supported by solid performance from our pro forma same-store portfolio, which produced NOI growth in line with our strong expectation for the back half of the year. Our G&A cost were about $0.01 per share favorable to expectations for the quarter, but a portion of this is timing related.  During the quarter, a promote fee associated with the wrap up of our Fund II joint venture. The total fee earned was $4.8 million with $2.5 million or about $0.03 per share recognized in FFO and with remaining portion related to gains on properties acquired from the joint venture applied to our investment basis in these properties. Additionally we made a $0.03 per share adjustment to interest expense from accounting adjustment related to four interest rate swap contracts acquired in the merger with Colonial and these two items combined produced the remaining $0.06 per share [indiscernible] expectations for the third quarter. Our pro forma same-store portfolio produced 6.8% NOI growth over the prior year, based on a 3.6% growth in revenues and a 80 basis point decline in operating expenses. As Eric mentioned, solid pricing performance continued through the third quarter producing 3.2% growth in effective rents with the remaining 40 basis points of growth coming primarily from higher average occupancy during the third quarter. Fiscal occupancy for the pro forma same-store portfolio ended the quarter at a strong 96.4% which is positioned well for the fourth quarter. The decline in operating expenses was primarily related to reductions in personnel, repair and maintenance and instruments cost as compared to the prior year, which are all areas where we've began to see the benefits from the merger. Our utilities and real estate tax expenses both increased during the quarter offsetting a portion of these declines. With the acquisition of the remaining two thirds of Verandas at Southwood, the final Fund II property located in Tallahassee Florida, total acquisition volume year-to-date was $178 million. As Eric mentioned we're currently pursuing additional acquisition opportunities that have accordingly increased our guidance to a range of $275 million to $375 million, for the full year a $75 million increase at the midpoint. We also sold five wholly owned multifamily communities during the third quarter, containing 2238 units for total gross proceeds of $115 million. These sales completed our 2014 multifamily disposition plans, which produced total proceeds of $158 million and recorded gains on sale of $42 million for the year. The average cap rate based on trailing NOI, a 4% management fee and total CapEx was 5.7% for the eight properties sold in 2014. Structure and lease-up of our development pipeline continues to progress well. During the third quarter, we funded an additional $11.4 million, a development cost primarily toward the two remaining construction communities, 220 Riverside located in Jacksonville and Colonial Grand at Bellevue II located in Nashville. Also during the quarter, two lease-up communities, Colonial Reserve at Frisco Bridges located in Dallas and Seasons at Celebrate Virginia II located in Fredericksburg reached full stabilization, which we consider greater than 90% occupancy for 90 days. We have communities remaining in lease-up at the end of the quarter, with an average ending occupancy of 94% and all four are on track to reach full stabilization during the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we also continue to capture balance sheet and financing benefits from the recent merger. We amended the agreement for $250 million term loan acquired from Colonial to reflect the strength of the combined balance sheet and the current market price. The amended loan, which matures in August of 2018 has a new credit spread, which is 65 basis points below the prior agreement at the current credit rate for the [company]. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet remains in great shape. Total company leverage based on market cap was 39.7%. The fixed charge coverage ratio was 4.1 times and our total debt to current EBITDA was 6.2 times. Also we have only $24 million of remaining funding commitment for our development pipeline with over $580 million of total cash and credit available under our line of credit at quarter end. Finally based on the third quarter performance, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. We now expect core FFO for full year to be in a range of $4.87 to $4.99 per share which is $4.93 at the midpoint. We continue to expect pro forma same store NOI to range from 4% to 4.5% for the full year. Core AFFO for the full year is now expected to be $4.12 to $4.25 per share, which represents about a 70% dividend payout at the midpoint. And now, I'll turn it over to Eric for some closing comments.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks Al. it was a good quarter for MAA as the work of the past year in integrating the legacy MAA and Colonial operations is ramping up and the benefit surrounding the merger are increasingly reflected in our results. We're encouraged with the leasing conditions across the portfolio and our team is focused on continuing to execute on the various operating improvements that have been made. We're making steady progress on recycling capital and continue to enhance portfolio quality and future internal growth prospects for the company. MAA's balance sheet is in terrific shape and we have ample capacity to execute in our plans moving forward. I want to thank all of our MAA associates for their hard work and extra effort surrounding our merger over the past few quarters. Thanks to your hard work and successful integration of our platforms, our consolidated operating and reporting systems are in great shape and the company is well positioned as we head into 2015. That's all we have in the way of prepared comments and Priscilla, we're going to turn it back to you for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald: Good morning, guys.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Hey David.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald: And I apologize in advance, I might have missed some of your opening remarks, it's been a bit busy today. Did you mention any plans for non-core asset sales in the retail, in the retail pool?
Albert Campbell III: We -- we've got the most of the remaining assets under contract to sell and would expect to get the remaining ones mostly closed by the end of this year. We've got some residual land assets that will probably slide into next year, but the operating assets, we expect to be gone by the end of this year.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay. And then -- I just want to go back to the sort of merger synergies and kind of reversal and OpEx in the quarter, and just talk about the sustainability of that, you said if you were to characterize the appearance of the synergies, are we sort of in early stages or is this kind of a one-shot deal? Do you expect that there will be additional savings, additional margin expansion in the next couple of quarters, how would you characterize that? 
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: I would say David that certainly the changes that been introduced to date are sustainable going forward. There are sort of permanent changes if you will that we've made. Now the year-over-year benefits of that will obviously lessen over time as we get to year-over-year comparisons reflecting where the change took place. But the changes that were made were more systemic in nature and as I said in my comments, it takes a while for these things to actually get implemented and then a while for them for being to show up. And Q3 being a busy quarter as it typically is, it really began to show up and with all the integration behind us in the early part of the year. So now there are few other remaining items that we're going to still harvest in the area of some turn activities and some other things that we're working on, but certainly what we've seen to date, we think will carry this going forward for some time,
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay. That's helpful. And then just my last question has to do with some of the ships in occupancy, which is counterintuitive in my view. The secondary markets were relatively stable, large markets had higher occupancy, was there increased concession activity if you achieve that, what do you think the dynamic was that created sort of some occupancy strength in the period?
Thomas Grimes Jr.: I think -- David this is Tom, I think clear eyes and a lot of focus generated that. We were a little -- I think in second quarter you saw a little bit more focus on secondary markets, but we felt like the large markets were not firing on all cylinders as we would like and you saw that build back quite well. I think our pricing performance which Eric mentioned in the call up $4.8 million for the quarter in the case that we didn't have to do anything out of the ordinary for those.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay, good. Thanks for the detail today.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities: Thanks. Good morning.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Hey Rich.
Thomas Grimes Jr.: Hey Rich.
Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities: So back to David's question on synergies if I can, I remember couple three, four quarters ago, the number of $0.30 to $0.45 of operating synergies was kind of, you know your game plan. Do you still have that view about pure operating synergies is always to G&A synergies and where are -- do you feel you are in terms of getting into that range right now?
Thomas Grimes Jr.: Let me answer initially Rich and then maybe Al can add some details, but in answering your question, we absolutely feel very confident about -- we actually the range that we show before on the NOI was $0.30 to $0.50 per share and we feel very good about achieving that. That's really broken down into four different components NOI stabilizing the development pipeline recycling non-earning assets and redevelopment of the Colonial assets. All those things run away and in fact on the NOI operating synergies. Frankly what we saw in the third quarter you just annualize that. We were at the very top into that range. So we spec we will probably do better than what we initially thought in that particular line item. The G&A savings which is the other big component of this roughly $25 million or $0.32 a share, you'll see that all next year. our run rate certainly about the end of this year as we've always said would be reflecting that savings and we feel very good about delivering on that value creation as we initially identify.
Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities: So the G&A of $0.32 is not included in the $0.30 to $0.50?
Albert Campbell III: No, that's additional above that.
Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities: Okay. And so you get all of that in 2015, but how much of the $0.30 to $0.50 do you think you get in 2015?
Albert Campbell III: I think the four items were NOI synergy stabilizing the development pipeline to give the majority of those two Rich. The other two items, the redevelopment of the Colonial assets and these recycling the non-earning assets, they're going to take a couple more years on the redevelopment pipeline. Just to give you an example we laid out 10,000 to 15,000 units of opportunity there. We feel very good about that. We did 2,000 this year. We'll probably do more like 3,000 next year. So it takes a few years to fully get that 10,000 to 15,000 units. But we feel very good about that program and the economics are still strong. The non-earning assets, the land, we'll probably be active on selling added thing and you'll see the impact more in '16 I would say.
Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities: Okay. So these two kind of in-process, are they half of the $0.30 to $0.50 or they less than that?
Albert Campbell III: They are on the recycle of non-funded assets there we said $0.08 range on the redevelopment program, $0.10 to $0.17 range. So the redevelopment program of that 30-50 is a pretty meaningful piece and we will see that play out over the next couple of years.
Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities: Okay, that's great, thanks. In terms of your dispositions, Eric, you mentioned $300 million possible in 2015. How much do you think will come out of the secondary markets being that you've had some little bit of choppiness there or are you not going to be willing to necessarily make a trade just because you had a couple of moving parts in the last couple of quarters.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Rich, we remain very committed to our strategy allocating capital both in large and secondary markets and the balance that we have today are roughly about 60% to 40% allocated, 40% allocated to secondary, 60% to large. We think that's the right model going forward. So we're not going to change that. Now having said that, of the $300 million that we probably will sell next year overwhelmingly that will be within the secondary market segment of the portfolio. There is some fine tuning within that component of the strategy that we're executing on. You will see and really the focus as it always has been for us is just to cycle some of the older lower margin investments and higher margin investments. As it so happens given the history of our company, a lot of our older investments happen to be in some of the more tertiary markets within that secondary market segment of the portfolio. So that you will see more of the recycling taking place within the secondary segment of the portfolio, but we remain very committed to the overall strategy.
Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities: Okay. I read a new story a few weeks ago about the jobless rate in the south being higher than -- it was surprisingly high considering this is where you'd see job growth Atlanta, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana and South Carolina, all registering high from an unemployment rate perspective. I'm not, I don't know if you saw that article and -- but I was just curious if you've sensed anything about a job, job growth perspective in some of your markets or if that's not kind of coming through in the numbers.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: I didn't see the article that you're referring to. What we have seen is in some select secondary markets weaker job growth than what we've seen take place in some of the larger markets and thus sort of the weaker performance out of the secondary segment of the portfolio -- market segment of the portfolio to specifically Memphis, Little Rock and Norfolk Virginia have been a little bit weak. San Antonio has been a little bit weak. Offsetting that though to some degree has been certainly Charleston, Savannah, Greenville, Spartanburg, South Carolina, they’ve been very strong. So it's hit or miss and some have been weak, some have been strong and so it's -- but again we continue to while the demand side or the job growth side of the model has been a little bit weak in some of those markets, the good news is that supply trends are still very muted within that group of markets overall and I think if can just continue, the economy pick up a little bit more steam. And you look at the job projections in the next year and the year thereafter, a lot of these secondary markets are showing pretty good momentum on the job front. So we're encouraged with the trends and I think that we should see that performance improve over the next year.
Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities: So is October 6, page 84 in the Wall Street Journal, I saved it just for you. And then last question is, the development pipeline reloading it, I'm curious I mean how much will development never being your kind of for take prior to Colonial, why now is it kind of the something that you wanted to do maybe with more of a long-term perspective?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: It's really no change Rich. We feel like that our approach to development has historically been and will continue to be built around essentially a pre-purchase model of something to be built by a developer. The incident or the occurrence of MAA actually being the developer is highly unlikely. We may do that on a phase two expansion or something of that nature. We're very familiar with the product, but broadly speaking when we talk about new development, what these really are pre-purchases of to be built properties. We think that the volume for us is going to probably be around $200 million to $300 million offset on a $8.5 billion balance sheet. So overwhelmingly the external growth story for us is largely continues to be built around acquiring existing assets.
Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities: Great color. Thanks a lot, appreciate it.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go now to Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital: Hi. Good morning.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Hi Karin.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital: Just wanted to ask about the incremental level of acquisition opportunities that you're seeing in the market today. Does that cause you to potentially consider accelerating the dispositions and the portfolio recycling that you're planning for the secondary markets for 2015, now that you're seeing, if you're seeing more volumes on the acquisition side?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: We're going to be selling more certainly on the apartment side in 2015 than what we've ever sold. We were selling about $300 in total this year call it half of its apartments have obviously existing commercial assets to Colonial. Next year the $300 million will be comprised totally of apartments, but having said that, our strategy is really built around a discipline of sort of steady recycling from lower margin investments to higher margin investments. We're not trying to make any sort of major portfolio shift or there is no strategy change that we're trying to pull off here. And as I said, we believe very much in being allocated between large and secondary markets. So what we're finding is and we've always found typically is good opportunities to harvest value out of lot of these assets and then see secondary markets by selling them in a very steady fashion on sort of a retail basis as opposed to putting a big package together and trying to find some wholesale buyer to take us out. So we're going to push the agenda there as aggressively as we can depending on redeployment opportunities, but we also are very mindful of protecting a steady of performance to steadily AFFO and the dividend, which we think is an important component of long-term shareholder returns. So we're going to push that agenda Karin as aggressively as we can, but to some degree it's a function of where the redevelopment or sort of the reinvestment opportunity plays out.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital: And where do you think the spread stands today on a cap rate basis between what you'd like to sell in the secondary market versus what you'd like to buy next year?
Albert Campbell III: Karin this is Al. I think one thing I'll point you to is on the eight assets we sold this year multifamily. if you take the trailing NOI minus the 4% cap management fee and all the CapEx internal property last year that's a 5.7% cap rate and I will say we're buying probably in the 5% to 5.5% range altogether. So it's tighter than you would think and on a cash flow basis. Now NOI to little bit wider spread than that, but on a cash flow basis, it's pretty tight.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital: That's helpful. Can you give us just a sense for how October trends where just what new on renewal, lease increases were and where occupancy stands here in October?
Thomas Grimes Jr.: Sure Karin, this is Tom and occupancy is at 96, exposures roughly 76, which is about 30 basis points better than it was the same time last year and this is on a year-over-year basis, new leases are blended was 5 and it's 4.8, new lease 5.2 renewal.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital: Okay. So October sounds like you continued the momentum that you saw in the…
Thomas Grimes Jr.: Yes and as Eric touched on some of these systems that we've in place to harvest efficiency and value are really beginning to pay off and we think we've got an opportunity for the next quarter or so to continue the improvements in our pricing arena.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital: That's helpful. And my last question is just on the performance of the primary markets versus the secondary markets. Can you just give a general sense as to where you think that the spread between -- the performance spread between those two groups is going to trend here in the next coming quarters? Do you think the gap is going to widen out further? Are you expecting the secondary markets to start to narrow the gap a little bit and do you have any visibility on improving job growth trends or any other types of trends that might be affecting the secondary market?
Thomas Grimes Jr.: We feel like the -- on a positive note both groups improved very well from the second quarter to the third quarter. We think that the gap between them will narrow, but are enjoying the strength of the primary markets. Looking forward, we're particularly encouraged by the lack of new supply in the secondary markets. Then we do have a few that have been pressured by weaker job growth Eric touched on those, with Memphis, Little Rock and Norfolk Virginia all at less than a percent of job growth over the last year or so. Those are expected to do a little bit better in 2015, but we need to monitor those. Memphis was affected, Memphis revenues were 140 basis points lower this quarter than we would have expected because of a couple of down units or because of a number of down units related to flood event, which will have back in the first quarter. So the job markets for the secondary group for those properties are expected to be 2.6%6 in Memphis next year, 2.9% in Little Rock and 2% in Norfolk, all of which bodes well for 2015. I would like to point out that we're seeing great strength in places like Charleston and it was up 3.4%, Greenville up 4.1% in revenues and Savannah at 5.1%. So I think we've to be careful not to bucket all properties as secondary. It really comes down to what the job growth characteristics were and those appear to be improving.
Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital: Thank you for the color.
Thomas Grimes Jr.: Thanks Karin.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital. Your line is open.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital: Hey, good morning guys. Al, Eric, quick question as it relates to turnover. What was turnover in the quarter? So what I'm trying to get is the mix of new lease versus renewals, how did that change kind of year-over-year. And then as you think about, given the strong renewal growth you had relative to more moderate new lease growth, where does the loss to lease in the portfolio or the differential between new lease and renewal rents in place right now stand.
Thomas Grimes Jr.: Hi Mike, it's Tom and we were down 847 fewer units or 6.6% during the quarter on that and rephrase the second part of that question if you don't mind.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital: Just given the strong renewal growth that you had during the quarter relative to more moderate new lease growth, where do kind of in-place rents today stand versus kind of market, if you just look at the delta even pushing on renewals versus new leases, I was trying to get a sense of how the ports in place rents compared to market right now.
Thomas Grimes Jr.: Well I can tell you that in the third quarter we reported overall year-over-year in-place leases for all of Q3 this year versus Q3 last year, up 3.2%. If you look at the leases that we just wrote in the third quarter, just in the third quarter compared to just the leases we wrote in the third quarter of the prior year, they were up 4.8%.
Albert Campbell III: And I'll just add to that Mike, if you look at the months in the quarter, September was the highest effective rent which was in-place at 3.5% showing escalation or growth of those new prices early in the portfolio that Eric was pointing out.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital: Okay, that's helpful. Second question, Eric, you touched a little bit more just in terms of the acquisitions in the pipeline, you are looking at those more secondary or primary markets, will there be a lease up component of those, can you just give us a little bit more color there?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: They are a mix of some large, some secondary markets and these are all stabilized assets.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital: Okay. Any comment on pricing?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: I would better wait till that to be closed on and we're talking about that next quarter.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital: No problem then. And then just in terms of development starts, I recall in a prior call you talking about kind of focusing the development starts more in the secondary markets, markets where it was hard to find product. Is that we should expect with development starts or these are going to be more primary?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: It's going to -- again it's going to be a mix. We've got a couple that we are looking at right now, once in large, once in secondary. We've got another one that we're really on in conversations about in another large market. So it's going to be a mix. We are increasingly finding more and more interest in this area of sort of developers who are looking for -- we're hearing from developers that financing equity capital in particular is getting more difficult. These guys are very much interested obviously in continuing to keep their doors open and stay in business and we're having a lot of conversations with a lot of developers who very much want to sort of build a sustained relationship with us. And so which also gives me some degree of comfort that hearing that the capital is tied with a lot of these developers gives me some comfort that the thread of massive overbuilding is pretty remote and so I think that we're encouraged with what we're seeing on that front.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital: That's all for me guys. Thank you.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go now to Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: Hey, good morning, guys.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Good morning.
Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: So, a couple of quick ones from me. Eric, I know it's probably a bit early to talk about 2015 guidance, but some of your partner maybe brethren have discussed a directional sense for 2015 same-store revenue. So I was wondering if you'd be willing to similarly provide an early sense of how you're feeling about same-store rev heading to 2015, especially given the comments you made about supply and to me a largest Sunbelt and then the job wage growth in your smaller Sunbelt markets.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: I think that I've seen what some of the others have said. I think that MAA is going to be competitive with the sector next year. I think that we're going to see -- 2015 looks very similar to 2014, just without the lumpiness and drama.
Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then one for you, Al, just wanted some clarification. Can you walk us through the adjustment for the treatment of the derivative contracts associated with Colonial merger? Just wanted to confirm that first thing what contemplated in prior guidance and then two, what's causing that adjustment to be reflected if booked now?
Albert Campbell III: Yes what that is when we acquired Colonial, there were four interest rate swaps that we acquired and they are very similar to swaps that we have, the plain are normal and they're hedging or locking in the rate on their term loans. When we acquired them though they had a market value. When we incur a swap or start a swap, there is zero balances and the accounting is every period when the change in value you record that to other competitive income, which is below net income. So we handle these swaps because they're similar same way and the technical accounting as we continue to review and scrub all of our treatment from the merger the technical accounting is actually to -- since those swaps had a market value at the time you purchased them, a portion of that change period to period should be applied back to interest expense. And so this was accumulative adjustment for Q4, one and two immaterial in any period presented, but to get it correct, we wanted to give you all information, so you could see it. We left it in FFO and core FFO because had we done it that way, through the life, it would have been in interest expense with the other items and so that's it in a nutshell. Is that what you were asking?
Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: Yeah, that was, I appreciate that. And then one small follow-up. On the 3Q asset sales, were those individual or was that a portfolio sale?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Those are individual asset sales.
Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And type of buyers, we are talking private, local buyers effectively. I am just curious if you're seeing any change in demand etcetera from those guys, just trying to get sense on the transactional market.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: No, these are all private buyers and generally they're not [at the core] (ph). They are funds that manage anywhere from companies that have institutional capital often behind them, but these are managed 5,000 to 7,000 units, one group out of California, one group out of New York, one group out of Dallas. So they're kind of all over the Board, but it's generally not just a small sort of country club kind of group of people. These are usually platforms again anywhere from five to one group ahead up to 15,000 units. But typically higher leverage buyers. They're usually getting agency financing anywhere from 75% to 80% financing on the deals and we're finding it a good market for that.
Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: Appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go now to Paula Poskon with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Good morning, Paula
Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson: Eric, I just wanted to follow up on stat in your prepared remarks about the move-outs to home buying, did you say that relative 14%?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: It was down 14% from what it was…
Albert Campbell III: Paula it's about 17% of move-outs right now.
Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson: Okay. And is there -- are you seeing any divergence across the communities in terms of or across your markets in terms of spikes up or down that surprised you?
Albert Campbell III: In terms of home buying, Paula?
Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson: Yes.
Albert Campbell III: Not really. I would tell you broadly it's lower than we thought it would be this year, but it's been relatively the normal band large markets moving out for home buying at a slightly higher rate than secondary, but nothing really stands out. They are pretty tightly banded between sort of low of 15 and high of 22 or so.
Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson: Okay. Thanks, Al. And the other comment was Eric, when you said the new supply you thought would just be in kind of in certain pockets, but not a wide spread concern. Are there specific markets or sub markets that you are concerned about for 2015?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: I'll Tom answer that Paula.
Thomas Grimes Jr.: Paula, we're still monitoring sort of the same suspects, Raleigh is probably the one that has shown the most is sort of most effective supply. It actually seems to be responding reasonably well now, but effective rent growth there was only about 1.2%, but blended rates for the quarter are actually up there. So we're encouraged by that. Austin we're monitoring I think along with everyone else, but their effective rent growth is fantastic and the jobs really just seem to be absorbing the units at a pretty good clip and then monitoring Dallas with that supply seems to be focused sort of Uptown area and North Dallas where we have relatively limited supply. So I would say those are sort of places where I am watching in 2015, but we keep the job growth numbers for '15 slightly better forecast than they were last quarter. So we are encouraged by the job growth side of the equation.
Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson: Okay. Thanks. That's all I have.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks Paula.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Your line is open.
Tom Lesnick - Capital One Securities: Hi. Good morning, guys. Just curious with the upper revision in your acquisition guidance is the -- are the sellers more tax motivated or what's driving that?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: It's really in every case is a brand new property. So these are developers who are looking to cycle out. They never intended to hold these assets for long and in one case, it's a property we've been tracking. It went under contract to someone else earlier recently fell out. They came back to us at our earlier pricing and we were able to make it work, but in every case these are one of the benefits of the new supply thing up in a number of these markets as I say is it's creating more and more eying opportunities and that's really what we were targeting is new product and so that's where we are seeing activity now.
Tom Lesnick - Capital One Securities: Great. And then how do your pre-purchase yield expectations compare to in-place acquisition cap rates right now?
Albert Campbell III: Usually about a 100 basis points higher from an NOI yield perspective.
Tom Lesnick - Capital One Securities: All right. Great, thank you.
Albert Campbell III: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go now to David Bragg with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to grab a couple of data points from me here at the end. First, what are the operating margins for the legacy and Colonial portfolios?
Albert Campbell III: Hold on just a second. I'll give you. As we talk about Dave, while we're pulling that, what it specifically is, the margin growth in the Colonial is 250 basis points improvement and it's a 130 basis points improvement on the legacy MAA piece, well actually underlying for synergy there Tim?
Tim Argo: Yes Dave, its Tim. For the legacy MAA, the NOI margin for Q3 was 59.9 and 59.5 for legacy CLP.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors: Okay. So they're pretty close to each other and generally given your knowledge of these two portfolios, do you expect them over time to be pretty comparable as they are now?
Albert Campbell III: I think that over time they probably will be. We frankly would expect to see the margin improvement grow a little bit in the CLP portfolio just as a consequence of some of these changes that Tom and his folks are working through as well as recognizing that there is a higher concentration of higher rent properties in the legacy CLP portfolio. Now as we continue with our recycling effort and continue to cycle out of some of the lower margin investments, older assets that we have, which as I mentioned earlier, a lot of the activity next year will take place in the legacy MAA portfolio. I think you’ll begin to see the margin then pick up more substantially in the legacy MAA portfolio. Ultimately they'll settle out about the same place, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see for the next year or so for the CLP margin portfolio to or margins in CLP portfolio to actually accelerate beyond MAA.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors: Okay, thank you for that. And the other thing is, we spoke about move-outs buy, but can you provide move-out to single family rental this quarter and a year ago?
Albert Campbell III: Sure Dave, move-outs to rent increases are actually down slightly from second quarter. It's 8% this quarter and then…
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: That's rent house.
Albert Campbell III: Sorry, rent house. That was what you were asking right?
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors: Renting the house, yes?
Albert Campbell III: And then it was -- so it was 7% this time last year.
Tim Argo: But it's moved up from 7% to 8% of our move-out over the last year.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors: 8% and 7%, okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go now to Buck Horne with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.
Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates: Hey guys, thanks. I think a little deep on my listed things to ask you guys, maybe any update on recent rent to income trends, are you seeing a larger group of higher income tenants or is it still relatively steady?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: No it's at 17%, which is still very, very good and the downturn is it probably peaked around 18% or 19% and so it's at a very healthy point and the Sunbelt I think apartments are affordable. There is a lot of upside on what people can pay in upfront.
Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates: And I'm pretty impressed that the resident turnover levels are declining and then as high as they are at this point of the cycle, I know if you got any additional color on, if you're surprised where the resident turnover levels are. I don't, I'm just the detail and can you -- do you have any of the station on where your tightest in your product like whether it's one-bedroom units or two bedroom units that are tighter right now and what the, what your tenants are doing in terms of managing their household structure?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: No about 70% of our households are single adult led. Home buying is the thing that we would tell you is slight different. I don't want to overstate this. We expected it would pick up a percentage point or two and it's dropped a couple. So not wildly different, but it was up in '13 from '12 and I think modestly and we expect that to continue and it didn't. But I think it really speaks as much as anything to our renter psychology, their appreciation of the flexibility of renting and frankly the fear of home buying. Nothing new here in terms of theory, but that's -- they're just staying same put a little longer and appreciating renting a little longer.
Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll move next to Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons. Your line is open.
Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons: Good morning.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Hi Carol.
Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons: I just have a question related to move-outs, are you all seen an increase from last year of tenants moving out related to a job transfer?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: That has moved up just a tad Carol. That's always been our largest cause for people leaving us and moving out and in the third quarter that constituted 29% of our turnover, whereas a year ago, it constituted 29% of our turnover. So that typically is the largest reason why people move out as a change in the tenant.
Thomas Grimes Jr.: And the downturn, that was the reason it was dropping, when we look at job transfers overall a positive sign.
Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And I’m showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Okay. Thank you. No closing comments. We’ll see a lot of you next week at the NAREIT. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect at any time.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for participating in the MAA Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Tim Argo, SVP of Finance. You may begin, Mr. Argo.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Aaron. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, Company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning’s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks, Tim. And appreciate everyone being on our call this morning. Second quarter results reflect good momentum on pricing, with same-store rents increasing 3.1% over the prior year. Revenue results largely reflect the impact of this pricing momentum with some offset from slightly higher vacancy losses compared against last year’s strong performance, as well as lower transaction fees resulting from reduced resident turnover during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, physical occupancy was a solid 95.7% and slightly ahead of last year’s 95.6%. As a result of the strong occupancy position at quarter end in July, average daily occupancy within the same-store portfolio has run 35 to 40 basis points higher than last year. And importantly, pricing momentum continued in July, with new lease rents increasing 4.1% year-over-year and renewal rents increasing an average of 5.8%. We’re encouraged with the pricing trends and the resulting revenue outlook for the back half of the year. As expected, same-store operating expenses were under some pressure for the quarter due to timing differences versus prior year from landscaping expenses, as well as a continued rise in real estate taxes reflecting higher valuation trends. Other expense line items during Q2 were generally in line to slightly better than we had forecast, with some favorability in performance capture due to lower resident turnover, which was down 7% as compared to last year. Pricing and revenue performance in a few of our secondary markets lagged performance elsewhere across the portfolio, as a combination of weaker job growth trends and tough prior-year occupancy comparisons, pressured performance in Memphis, Birmingham, Jacksonville and San Antonio. Solid results were achieved in Charleston, Savannah and Greenville. Generally, the secondary market segment of the portfolio continues to avoid the higher new supply trends that we see in a number of our larger markets. But we need to capture a stronger lift in the broader economy and employment conditions for several of these secondary markets to capture more robust rent growth. Within our large-tier market segment of the portfolio, as expected, Raleigh was our weakest performer as the market their works through some new supply deliveries. We continue to feel good about the long-term prospects in Raleigh and expect we’ll see supply pressures peak this year and better pricing trends emerge in 2015. Strong revenue results from Nashville, Charlotte, and our Texas markets contributed to solid performance for the large-tier market segment of the portfolio. As outlined in the earnings release, given the performance trends we saw in the second quarter and in July, we have adjusted our forecast assumptions for revenues and expenses, which are expected to generate a solid growth NOI in the 4% to 4.5% range for the full year. Our team was very busy during the second quarter, wrapping up the consolidation of the MAA and Colonial operating systems platforms. We’re now fully operational on the same property management, asset management and management reporting systems. After closing our merger in October, we felt the best opportunity for capturing the full benefit surrounding synergy and scale was to get both companies and back-office operations fully consolidated as quickly as possible and prior to the busy summer leasing season. It took quite a bit of focus and a lot of extra hours during the second quarter. I’m proud of the work accomplished by our folks and really appreciate their hard work. With the vast majority of the integration work and risk now behind us, we’re fully focused on harvesting the various operational opportunities surrounding our merger. Our new development pipeline continues to lease-up very well. During the second quarter, we wrapped up construction on the projects in Charlotte and in Orlando, leaving our projects in Nashville and Jacksonville as the only remaining construction actively underway. We expect to begin initial occupancy at these two properties later this year. Leasing continues to go well on our lease-up portfolio, and we expect to achieve full stabilization of the majority of these units by the end of this year with full earnings production in 2015. We continued to make good progress on selling the remaining non-core properties that were acquired as part of our merger with Colonial. We’re in final due diligence with several buyers and expect to close on the sale of two more properties during the third quarter. We’re also busy during the quarter with capital recycling, as planned dispositions for several of our older apartment properties were completed in the second quarter and in July. We currently have two additional apartment properties located in Mobile, Alabama under contract to sell and expect to complete those dispositions during the third quarter. We continue to look at quite a bit of acquisition opportunity. But as discussed last quarter, a lot of investor interest and favorable interest rates makes the buying market very competitive. Properties involving pre-stabilized new development are where we’ve seen the greatest increase in deal flow, and I expect this area of the transaction market will remain fairly active for the next year or so. As noted in our earnings release, we closed on two such transactions during the second quarter and are currently looking at several other opportunities. AI will recap for you the successful bond transaction that was executed during the quarter and summarize where we are with our balance sheet. We feel very good about where the balance sheet is at this point and expect that as the new development and lease-up pipelines become fully productive, we will continue to see strengthening coverage ratios and continued expansion of our unencumbered asset base. In summary, we’re encouraged with the performance outlook for the balance of the year from the same-store portfolio and expect to deliver – we will continue to capture solid NOI growth for the full year. Our new development and lease-up pipelines are becoming increasingly productive and we look for meaningful contribution from this component of the balance sheet in 2015. We’re making good progress on stock and capital from the non-core assets acquired in the Colonial acquisition, and are optimistic that we will capture attractive new investment opportunities for this capital. With the heavy lifting of the merger and back-office integration now complete, we’re excited to be focused on harvesting the full value surrounding our merger. The balance sheet is in a strong position, and we expect to see further strengthening as the development pipeline and capital recycling from non-core assets continue. Market conditions support our plans for a higher level of capital recycling within our stabilized portfolio of properties. And we expect to continue that over the next several quarters, mindful of maintaining coverage ratios and our strong balance sheet metrics. That’s all the way I have in comments. And Al, I’ll turn it over to you.
Albert M. Campbell III: Okay. Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I’ll provide some additional commentary on the Company’s second quarter earnings performance, the balance sheet activity and finally on updated earnings guidance for the year. FFO for the quarter was $95.5 million, or $1.20 per share. Core FFO, which excludes non-routine items, primarily the merger and integration costs and the fair market value adjustment for debt assumed, was $93.9 million or $1.18 per share, which was within our guidance range and $0.03 per share below the midpoint. About $0.02 per share of the variance is related to same-store NOI, with another penny per share related to earlier-than-expected timing of our bond issuance during the second quarter. As Eric mentioned, rent pricing trends remained good and in line with our expectations during the second quarter. But we carried about 35 basis points lower effective occupancy than projected, generating about a penny per share variance to the midpoint of our guidance. Fee revenue was also lower than expected for the quarter, as transaction and termination fees were below projections, generating another penny per share of variance. We made a decision during the quarter to execute our planned bond financing almost a month earlier than initially projected in order to take advantage of the favorable market conditions and timing. The transaction proved very successful as we issued 10-year bonds at a 3.75% coupon and upsized the deal to $400 million from $350 million originally planned. But the earlier-than-planned timing cost about a penny per share in the second quarter as we carried more debt than forecasted in the short-term.
 : Fund II, which is our joint venture, also sold one community in Macon, Georgia during the second quarter for gross proceeds of $25.8 million, one-third of which was owned by MAA. Activity continued in July as we sold three additional communities located in Memphis, Birmingham and Charlotte for combined proceeds of $95.6 million and acquired the remaining two-thirds interest in the final Fund II property, closing Fund II. Construction and lease-up of our development pipeline continues to progress well. We funded an additional $13.1 million of development costs during the second quarter and fully completed two communities, Colonial Reserve at South End in Charlotte and Colonial Grand at Lake Mary Phase 2 in Orlando. We now have two communities remaining under construction, with a total remaining funding commitment of only $33.7 million. Total construction costs and lease-up targets in the aggregate remain on track, and we expect stabilized yields in the 7.5% range for the current development and lease-up pipeline. During the second quarter, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet by using the proceeds from the issuance of $400 million of 10-year unsecured notes mentioned earlier to repay $198 million of secured Freddie Mac debt and $192 million maturing bonds series acquired from Colonial. As mentioned, we executed the deal little earlier than planned, capitalizing on market demand to achieve a credit spread of 125 basis points above 10-year treasury, which exhibits the strength of our balance sheet.

 : Also at the end of the quarter, company leverage based on market cap was 35.5% and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.6 times. Our total debt to Recurring EBITDA was 6.41 times and we had $488 million of cash and credit available under our unsecured line of credit at quarter end. And finally, as expected, there are many crosscurrents included in our earnings guidance this year as we work through the integration and consolidation of Colonial, along with a related higher level of both non-core and core capital recycling transactions. Based on the second quarter performance and updated expectations for the remainder of the year, we are revising core FFO guidance for the full year to an expected range of $4.79 to $4.95 per share at the midpoint of the range, which is $0.47 per share. This represents a revision of $0.04 per share for the remainder of the year. We are narrowing our NOI guidance for the full year to 4% to 4.5%, which translates into a penny per share revision to core FFO for the back half of the year. And additionally, we now expect $0.03 per share impact in the second half from transaction, timing and corporate items. Of these, we now expect to achieve our full year multi-payment disposition target by mid-third quarter, which is earlier than we originally projected, costing us about a penny per share versus the earlier forecast. Also, we upsized our bond deal in the second quarter. We issued $400 million versus the $350 million planned, which increased our interest rate protection for the long-term, but cost us about a penny per share over the remainder of 2014. And finally, after filing our franchise tax returns and extensions for 2013, we increased our franchise tax accrual rate primarily due to changes in our tax base from the Colonial merger, which will cost us an additional penny per share over the remainder of this year. And together, all of these items account for the $0.04 per share revision to the forecast for the back half of the year. Also during the third quarter, we expect to record gains on the sale of several properties of around $34 million, along with a $2.5 million prepayment charge on a related loan, all of which are excluded from core FFO for the quarter, but maybe important for modeling purposes. Quarterly core FFO per share is expected to be $1.15 to $1.27 per share for the third quarter and $1.21 to $1.33 for the fourth quarter. Core AFFO for the full year is expected to be $4.04 to $4.20 per share, which represents a 71% dividend payout at the midpoint. We expect to end the year with our balance sheet in very good shape, leverage at the low end of the range, somewhere around 42% debt to gross assets, encumbered assets at historic levels, greater than 65% and with coverage ratios very strong greater than 3.5 times, position well to support 2015. So that’s all we have in the way of comments. Aaron, I’ll turn the call over to you for questions.
Operator: Certainly. (Operator Instructions) We will first take a question from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.: Good morning, guys.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Hi, David.
Albert M. Campbell III: Good morning.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.: I’m still kind of struggling to understand the real mix of secondary market trouble, or I guess sort of why it fell a little bit shy of your expectations. And I know you, Eric, you mentioned employment and tough comps. But maybe if you could just provide a little bit of detail on the mix of rent at the new and renewal level, and also maybe comment on what you’re seeing in terms of move-outs to home purchases, and specifically where there’s troubling supply.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.:  Okay. Well, let me start with it on some of this, and then Tom can give you some information on the pricing. But broadly speaking, David, I think, the secondary market segment story really centers around the employment issue. This segment of the portfolio continues to not see the level of new supply that we are seeing take place in some of larger markets. The only areas where we’ve seen any sort of real supply issue – we have a submarket in Jacksonville where we’ve got a couple of properties that have seen a little supply and we’ve seen a little supply in San Antonio. But, broadly speaking for the segment as a whole, it really gets back to employment trends. And we know that when the economy starts to recover that the bigger markets, like Dallas and Houston, are going to really do quite well. But I think we have to see the economy lift at a more accelerated pace than what we’ve seen thus far to really get the job growth trends more favorable down at the secondary market level. And give you some perspective on it. We use a lot of information from moodyseconomy.com in terms of job growth projections. And if you look at 2013 job growth year-over-year in the secondary market’s segment, we underperformed in that segment. Those markets underperformed national employment trends by about 70 basis points. And then, in 2014, we’re tailing by about 30 or 40 basis points. But if you look at the projections for 2014 through 2016, which I know – assumes that we continue to see some acceleration in the employment markets. The secondary markets, they approach performing at a level consistent with sort of national trends. And of course the large-tier share markets are blowing away the national trends. They are doing much, much better. So I really believe that – and then in particular, we had, Memphis is an example where we had some real tough comps. Last year, our occupancy – we carried roughly 97% occupancy in Q2 last year and we’re comparing against that this year. So Memphis in particular had a tough comp, as an example. But I think really it gets back to the job growth trends and we just have not seen the growth take place in these markets up to this point. But at least the projections are assuming the economy continues to show some progress that we’ll see things get better as get into 2015 and 2016. But we still don’t see really the supply issues. Before I turn it over to Tom, the other point I will tell you is move-outs to home buying and move-outs to renting a home are actually less in secondary markets than they are in the large markets. So it’s not a unique issue surrounding single-family in any way affecting the secondary markets. Tom?
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: Sure. David, the new lease renewal blended trends follow what Eric laid out. We’ve got markets such as Little Rock and Memphis. During the quarter, Little Rock was up 0.2%, Memphis 2.2%. That’s on a blended year-over-year basis. And then places like Savannah, Charleston, they were 7%, 8.3%. It really just sort of depends on where they’re fitting in the spectrum of job growth. Limited new supply in Jacksonville in those pieces.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: It is a mixed bag, because as I commented, Memphis, Birmingham, we saw weakness. Huntsville has been weak; Columbia, South Carolina has been weak for us, as has Columbus, Georgia. But Savannah has been strong, Chattanooga has been relatively strong, Charleston has been strong. Greenville has been strong.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.: Okay, that’s helpful. And then, if we just think about – like, to take an asset in particular that may be a little bit weak from your perspective, what is the conversation like at the ground level, with tenants on renewals and incoming tenants? If it’s a market where there’s weak employment, our people just pushing back on rent? Are you sort of giving up a little bit of rent to keep occupancy, and keep the turn rates low? What’s the actual dynamic in an asset?
Albert M. Campbell III: No, David. And when you look back at our comp versus last year, we needed to carry our average physicals and we did. And of course, there’s the temptation to really tradeoff hard on pricing to get to that number. We feel like there’s good re-pricing in the portfolio and we feel like we have an opportunity to push that through. Move-outs to rent increases are actually down like 14%. So that dynamic is not occurring. We’re sticking to our guns on pricing and feel good about that long-term tradeoff. We have solid occupancy. We don’t have as good as what we planned on.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.: Okay. That’s helpful. And my last question is just a detail, and I might have missed this. But did you comment on what your plans are for the Las Vegas assets?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: We didn’t comment on it. I would tell you, David, we’re taking a hard look at that. We’ve got only two properties in that market. And we’re going to be looking at our plans over the next couple years as we talk about recycling, and we’ll have more to say about it then. But I think that we either need to bigger or out, one of the other. And we haven’t made a firm decision on that yet.
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: And just a comment on Las Vegas, we closed July $96.4 million there with low exposure, 7% and rents were beginning to pick up. We feel like you’ll see better traction in Las Vegas in the second half of the year than you have in the first half.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks for the detail today.
Operator: And we’ll next go to the site of Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.
Ryan H. Bennett – Zelman & Associates, LLC: Hi, good morning, guys. Just to follow-up, just on your outlook for the full year, given the second quarter. You revised the core FFO guidance and walked through the detail there. Just curious, you’ve maintained this fourth quarter guidance, I believe, is why I’m just curious. If you could just walk us through kind of how you get back to that by the fourth quarter as we think about the run rate into 2015? And then, as part of that, the income contributions you’re thinking about from the redevelopments of Colonial assets later on this year?
Albert M. Campbell III: Hi, Ryan, this is Al. I can talk to you. Remember, there’s a lot of crosscurrents going on this year that affect the quarter-to-quarter and changes quarter-to-quarter. Let me just tell you how we approach looking at the back half and how our guidance has established large element. So if you look at what we’re expecting, we really expecting – rent trends have been good this year, first quarter and second quarter and continued to do so in July. So we expect those to continue. And we expect, really to hold number one, those rent trends will continue to compound through effective rents as you move into third quarter, even more so in the fourth quarter, probably the biggest contribution in the fourth quarter. We expect to really hold the strong occupancy that we held at the end of the second quarter. We ended at 95.7%, and we expect to hold that strong for the year. And as Tom mentioned, we didn’t capture quite as much effective occupancy during the second quarter as we wanted. Our plan is to hold that and to not have that happen again over the back half of the year and then to capture more fee performance. As we talked about, transaction fees were down a little bit, I think, for a couple of reasons. One is that we didn’t capture quite as much opportunity related to some of the programs on the Colonial side of the portfolio. We had hoped in the second quarter. We feel very good about that performance in the fourth quarter that is there. It’s a little bit later than we had thought. If you think about the revenue trends, that gives you the line. And on expenses, as we had always talked about in our guidance, we did expect the biggest pressure point to be in the second quarter. Had we talked about that someone may read a couple of things. Real estate taxes for the year, they’re 6.5%. But just because the timing of the accruals last year and this year, the first half was higher. I think the first half average was 8.2%. So you can see it’s higher than the year. We expect some reprieve at the back half. And then, we talked about our landscaping expenses. And we just had a pretty significant difference this year to last year in the landscaping expenses. They fall where the work – the time the work is done. So when we put the two, Colonial portfolio and our portfolio together, our practices changed a little bit. And we had a lot more of the expense problem in the second quarter as we did our [mulches] (ph) and annual things that we do. We expect to see that reprieve in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, primarily in third quarter. So my point being, the back half of the year is largely based on continued rent trends, holding occupancy, capturing the other income of the fees that we talked about and lower expenses. And the final thing is, we have captured in the second quarter some favorable expenses from some of the synergy, probably some of the things that we had planned to do. Our costs were low in personnel and R&M, and we look for that to continue in the back half of the year. And then, we also had an insurance renewal that will affect the back half of the year. We penciled it on July 1 and we get a 20% reduction – somewhere between a 15% and 20% reduction. So I’m just giving the color for all those things that combine both our income and our expense and make us feel good about the back half of the year, that performance.
Ryan H. Bennett – Zelman & Associates, LLC: Got it. I appreciate the color there. But just in terms of your comments about holding rents and seeing that positive trend, what’s kind of baked into your baseline economic assumptions for the secondary markets in the back half of the year? Are you modeling in pretty significant pickup? Or is it more stable, what we’ve seen? Have you kind of dialed that back a little bit?
Albert M. Campbell III:  In secondary markets, as we talked about, we took the back the back half of the year down a penny per share primarily for secondary market performance that Eric talked about. Pretty consistent in trends, but we just soften it a little bit from the secondary markets. But still, we expect good trends going out.
Ryan H. Bennett – Zelman & Associates, LLC: Okay, got it. And then, just building on that, just on the transaction side doing the deals in Memphis and Birmingham, after the quarter here, just any indication give us on pricing, and how that came in relative to your expectations given the economic backdrop in those markets?
Albert M. Campbell III: They came in pretty good. I think the average of those that we sold in July was just south of 7%. I think the average of the two that we sold during the quarter was closer to 6.5%, 6.4% or something like that, and they were in Forth Worth. So I’ll say it this way. We’ve sold, I think, six of the eight assets that we had for the full year in the program to sell $140 million to $150 million in multifamily. We expect the cap rates to be just south of 7% on that and that’s what we captured so far. And we expect the remaining two that are about $20 million to be the same.
Ryan H. Bennett – Zelman & Associates, LLC: Okay, great.
Albert M. Campbell III: That’s on a $3.50 per unit CapEx, 4% of management fee, and in-place NOI.
Ryan H. Bennett – Zelman & Associates, LLC: Okay, got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: And we will next to the site of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital. Your line is now open.
Michael J. Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Thanks. Just following up Ryan’s question there, in your presentation at NAREIT, you kind of walked through kind of what you expected in terms of same-store revenue and NOI there on a quarterly basis. Can you give us an update as to how you’re thinking in the third and fourth quarter, just in terms of trends and the contributions there?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Well, I mean, I’ll let Al give you the specifics, but broadly speaking, what we’ve done is we’ve pulled back a little bit on the revenue assumptions and improved a little bit, if you will, on the expense assumptions. So on a net basis, we still believe – our original guidance for the year was 4% to 5% NOI growth and we’ve dialed it back to 4% to 4.5%. So still within the range, the bottom half of the range we originally started with. But we’re just going to get there a little bit differently with a little – based on what we’ve seen so far this year, a little weaker revenue growth, but better expense control frankly. And the net result is 4% to 4.5% NOI growth for the full year. And it really reflects all the things we’ve been saying in terms of what Al just walked through in terms the back half of the year and based on what we’re seeing thus far. I mean, Al, you want to…
Albert M. Campbell III: Yes, I’ll just give you – if you did the math on it, Mike, you’re going to need from our estimates about 3.6% revenue growth over the back half of the year. Okay? So third quarter, we expect somewhere in the 3% to 3.5% range. Fourth quarter, as we continue to compound those rents in and capture those fee opportunities, 3.5% to 4% range that shows you how we expect that to average out.
Michael J. Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. That’s helpful there. Second of all, just given the comments about the secondary markets performance there being seemingly more job growth and supply-related. Does that make you rethink the mix of the portfolio a bit more? I know when you announced the Colonial portfolio, you said you had your target mix, but does that make you shift maybe a little bit more in favor of the primary markets?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: I’ll tell you, Mike, not materially so. I think that we continue to believe very much in the notion that we want to deploy capital for a full cycle sort of performance profile. We always have understood that the secondary markets that don’t capture quite the level of robust job growth that you get in the bigger markets struggle at various points in the cycle. They don’t likewise get the supply pressures that you typically see in the larger markets as well. While certainly there are some weaknesses that we saw this quarter, again this quarter, in Memphis, Birmingham and the others that I’ve mentioned, we’ve also seen some strength in some others. And so, I would tell you that in terms of a sort of overall long-term performance objective, we still feel very much that the right thing to do is continue to allocate roughly 60% to 65% of our capital to the large markets and 35% to 40% to the secondary markets. Now, what you’re going to see as a consequence of our capital recycling effort, you’re going to see some recycling take place, and it will be more active within the secondary market segment of the portfolio. There are some secondary markets where we think the prospects are not nearly as strong as they are in some other secondary markets. We feel like we can still go into some of these higher growth secondary markets that – Charleston is an example and some others that we’ve been buying in. And we can still get the performance dynamics over the long haul, but I think put capital in a position where it’s going to create a little bit more robust long-term organic growth rate. And that’s what we’re really trying to do.
Michael J. Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Appreciate the color, guys. Thank you.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks Mike.
Operator: And we will next go to the side of Rich Anderson with Mizuho. Your line is now open.
Rich Anderson – Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd.: Hey, good morning.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Good morning, Rich.
Albert M. Campbell III: Hi, Rich.
Rich Anderson – Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd.: Welcome to my site. You talked about capital recycling. Would you be willing in this market, with cap rates being where they are, to actually take on a little bit more dilution in the short-term if you found the right situation, even if you didn’t have a synonymous amount of redeployment opportunity, just to take advantage of the transaction market today to clean up the portfolio?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: The answer is, within reason. I will tell you that this year in particular is a challenging year from a recycling perspective, in that not only are we eating dilution surrounding recycling multifamily capital, but we’re also eating dilution cycling out of some commercial assets, which is pretty darn dilutive, selling those at much higher cap rates. And we’re also eating dilution from the development lease-up pipeline, all of which does first – the development pipeline will largely be fully productive going into next year. And we certainly expect to be cycled out of a lot of the commercial assets by next year. So those two areas of current earnings solutions kind of goes away. My guess is that you what will see is a higher level of recycling taking place within the apartment side of things, stabilized portfolio going into next year. But, again, we’re willing to – we’re eating about $0.14 of earnings this year. And I wouldn’t want to see that go up significantly from that, because we are committed to protecting the balance sheet and making sure that we don’t step back from all the work that we’ve done for the last five years, frankly, to get the balance sheet where it is. But our capacity for handling dilution improves in the sense we can cycle more multifamily next year, because we won’t have the dilution surrounding the lease-up and the commercial recycling.
Rich Anderson – Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd.: Okay. And in terms of cap rates, obviously, the multifamily side, you’ve probably seen some compression there. Maybe you can comment on that. But has there been any move at all on the commercial side from a cap rate perspective?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Not that I’m aware of, Rich. We’re not, I would say, particularly active in the commercial side of things. We just got two assets in the land asset that we’re rotating out of. So I can’t really comment a lot on the commercial side. These two operating commercial assets that we’ve got, we’ve had them under contract now for a while. So it’s not like we’re really active in the market. So I couldn’t tell you if there’s been any real compression or not.
Rich Anderson – Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd.: Okay. And then, just a quick one for Al. The mark-to-market, the $90 million, how quickly will that trend down? How long will that take?
Albert M. Campbell III: That is amortized over 4.5, almost five years, Rich. It’s a little bit frontend-loaded in that as individual pieces of debt in that mature, it comes down. So I would say it doesn’t come down quickly, but it will come down each quarter a portion until it’s very low by the end of the fourth year.
Rich Anderson – Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd.: Okay.
Albert M. Campbell III: So, I can probably offline give you a little more specific math, but it helps you give you the trend of it.
Rich Anderson – Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd.: Okay. That’s good. Thanks, guys, I appreciate it.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks, Rick.
Operator: And we’ll now take a question from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Haendel St. Juste – Morgan Stanley: Hey, good morning guys.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Good morning.
Haendel St. Juste – Morgan Stanley: Eric, maybe Tom, can you take us behind the scenes of the last three or four weeks of the quarter? Trying to get a sense what the major change factor was between NAREIT, the first week of June where you had seemingly much rosier expectations for same-store revenue for the quarter, mid to maybe upper 3s than what you actually achieved. Trying to get a sense, more clarity, granularity on how the results came in so much lower than what we expected, when after all this is the apartment business; we have pretty good forecast ability, you have revenue management, which gives you the opportunity to assess upcoming lease expirations, absorption, competitive pricing, et cetera.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Haendel, this is Eric. And I’ll tell you that the pricing trends played out very much like we expected. The two things that surprised us a little bit was the effective occupancy point that we’ve mentioned, as well as the transaction fees. And I can tell you, if you will, behind the scenes, getting to your question, May was sort of the apex of work going on regarding back office, conversion and integration processes. We started the conversion over to Yardi in latter part of the first quarter, and really working it – taking a division at a time, if you will. And May was a time where we had the greatest fog, if you will regard what was happening at the property levels. We knew that where occupancy was at the end of the quarter, or at the end of May into early June. We knew what sort of occupancy was at that point. What we didn’t have real clarity on at that point was the average daily occupancy that we had throughout the month of May. And when we got back and sort of got the two different sets of reports in two different systems, and got all the information compiled, it was obvious that we had given up roughly 35 basis points of effective occupancy during the course of the month of May, beyond what we had anticipated. And so that was really where the difference came from. So, good news is in June we wrapped it all up. And at this point, we’re all in the same system. We’ve got great insight now into everything and feel very good about where we are.
Haendel St. Juste – Morgan Stanley: Would you be willing to share with us the new and renewal by month for April, May and June? And then what the month and occupancy numbers were for those months as well?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Tom got it.
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: Sure, Haendel. All right. So April, May and June on year-over-year basis work for – April was 2.7% May for 4.3%, June 3.2% on new lease. And then renewal was 7.3%, 7.6%, 7.6% and 7.5% for the quarter.
Haendel St. Juste – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then, the…
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: We ended June at 95.7% and April and May were both 95.1%.
Haendel St. Juste – Morgan Stanley: Okay. So, you mentioned that your renewals for July here were 5.8%, so a little bit below what you were getting during the second quarter. What are you sending out today for August? And do you have an expectation of where you think that’ll be?
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: We’ve got it. And on a year-over-year basis – actually I only have lease-over-lease for that right now, Haendel. So July, lease-over-lease was 8%, August 7.3%, September 6.4%, October 6.6%. We intentionally tail off. We don’t push on renewals as hard in fourth quarter moving into the summer season as we typically do during the busier season.
Haendel St. Juste – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And as far as occupancy at 95.7%, is this a level you feel comfortable sustaining here near-term, would you like to build that up a bit as we get the back half of the year end well?
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: Our strategy is we’ve got the best re-pricing opportunity sort of late second, early third. And then we being to build our occupancy and lower our total exposure as we head into the slower winter months. We are looking like – we close July today, but expect that to be at 96% with exposure, which is total availability, close to 0.3%. That’s compared to 9.2% last year. And our average physical occupancy during the quarter or during the month looks like it’s going to be up about 30 basis points, as Eric mentioned in his comments.
Haendel St. Juste – Morgan Stanley: Thanks.
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: So, yes, to answer your question, I would expect occupancy to run much closer, or slightly better, but much closer to last year’s numbers in the second half than in the first half.
Haendel St. Juste – Morgan Stanley: Thank you.
Operator: And we will next take a question from Buck Horne with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is now open.
Buck Horne – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on economic cap rates in your markets based on the levels of investments that you’re seeing out there in transactions. Just what are you seeing for A and B properties in the Sunbelt relative to the gap between large markets and some of the secondary markets?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Buck, this is Eric. I would tell you that broadly speaking, for the higher-end product, new product in some of the larger markets we’re seeing economic cap rates on a stabilized NOI level, sort of 4.8%, 4.9% to probably 5.25%. And in the secondary markets, it may be 5% to 5.5%, probably no more than 50-basis point spread, but broadly in that kind of range for the sort of more stabilized assets, frankly none of which we’ve been buying, because that’s in particular where the competition is pretty fierce. But we’re seeing stabilized assets, five, six, seven-year-old properties to some of the large markets, good locations, trading 5% to 5.5%, and in the secondary markets probably 5.5% to 5.75%. It’s rare to find anything at 6% today.
Buck Horne – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That’s helpful. And you mentioned how move-outs to single-family or – home buying and/or single-family rentals is down year-over-year. Could you quantify those numbers for us, and give us some perspective on what you’re seeing in those trends?
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: Yes, sure. The turnover on home buying was, it dropped from about 20% to 19% on that. And then, on single-family rentals, I don’t we indicated were down. They were up modestly, but still running there in the 9% range, still a third of the level of our larger reasons for move-out, which are home buying and job transfer.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: And the trends have been fairly consistent for awhile now. I mean, the move-outs to renting a home have ticked up just a tad. But it’s gone from roughly sort of 6% of our move-out to about 9% of our move-out. But as Tom said, it’s really not a meaningful impact overall. What really has been helpful in terms of driving turnover down is the continued low move-outs to buying a house. And we saw a drop again this quarter. So that’s an area that’s been very helpful.
Buck Horne – Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks Buck.
Operator: And we’ll now take a question from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.
Karin A. Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Hi, good morning. Question for Eric. The focus of your comments earlier regarding the revenue underperformance in the second quarter really were centered around the secondary markets. Should we infer from that that primary markets all performed as you had expected for the quarter, and that you expected the deceleration, I think, was 50 basis points that you saw from 1Q to 2Q in those markets including Atlanta, Austin, South Florida, all of those performed as you’d expected?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Yes, I would tell you broadly speaking that majority of the performance issue was in the secondary markets. Now, Atlanta as an example, we gave up, it looks to be, about 70 basis points. Austin we gave up a little more than that in terms of year-over-year effective occupancy, again just the quarter. And as I alluded to, the market that we saw the most pressure in was in Raleigh and fully expected that. But broadly speaking, when you look at the revenue trends overall, I mean, Atlanta driving 3.7% year-over-year growth in revenues and Austin driving 4% year-over-year growth in revenues, despite the give-up and effective occupancy that we saw in both Atlanta and Austin, we still delivered pretty darn good revenue growth overall. And broadly speaking, the only market that really was weak per se was Raleigh. And then, Tampa was a little bit weak there. But Tampa is a market that – frankly, we were just comparing against a little higher-occupancy variable there. And we gave up, it looks to be, about 60 or 70 basis points there in Tampa. But Tampa’s back. It’s hard to draw any broad conclusions from just three months to three months year-over-year. We still feel good about Tampa long-term, certainly. But largely, the large markets generally performed pretty much in line with what we were expecting.
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: And, Karin, as we look forward to the second half, some of those markets that Eric mentioned are ones that we look to for further improvement over the first half of the year. Atlanta and Austin both trended very good in July. And we’re looking at 96.2% there on effective occupancy in Atlanta, and rents and renewals over – new lease rents at 5.5% and renewals 8.9%; supply and check in Atlanta. Austin is 96.7% now, below 7% exposure. There’s certainly some supply going on there. It’s much heavier in that central town like area than it is in the suburbs, though there is some. And then, Dallas, Fort Worth, Tampa and Las Vegas, we would expect those to perform better in the second half than they did in the first half.
Karin A. Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Thanks for the color. My second question is on the merger and integration. You alluded to the focus on that in the second quarter causing sort of a lack of information for you guys for a period of time. Do you think it also – just because of the intense sort of nature of that transition, do you think that caused your team to take the eye off sort of the operational ball in 2Q? If so, do you expect that to reverse in the second half? Or is it just really that informational gap that you had and maybe a delay in the merger synergies that you saw in 2Q?
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: Karin, I saw a lot of people really since October 1 with their eye on the ball and working incredibly hard with a lot going on. I will tell you going forward, we’re sort of ecstatic to be done with it. I think we have great insights. Our teams have gelled in terms of working together with each other. Our systems are in place. We’re no longer rolling out a new process, a new procedure, a new software. And I think you see some of the results of that in July, and I think we’ll continue to learn how to wring out the value of this merger as we move forward.
Karin A. Ford – KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.:  Thanks, Karin.
Operator: And we’ll now take a question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open
Tayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Yes, good morning. Just two questions. In regards to asset sales during the quarter and subsequent to the quarter, you did make sales in Fort Worth and as well as Charlotte, which are some of your larger markets. And I think you guys have always expressed most of your asset sales will come from the smaller markets. Just curious why in particular these assets were sold.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Tayo, in all cases, there were some legacy Colonial assets, pretty old. Some pretty significant CapEx requirements that we just concluded, that we’d be better off to cycle out of those. So they were just unique in the sense of – these are old, frankly, assets that come to Colonial through the Cornerstone merger that they executed well over 10 years ago. So there’s no change in strategy. It’s just unique situations pertaining to age and the CapEx requirements associated with those particular assets.
Tayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Company, Inc.:  Got it. That’s helpful. And then, could you just talk a little bit – give a little bit more detail about the Austin, Texas market in particular? I know it’s one of these markets – you had a lot of exposure to it. And you had always mentioned rising supply in Austin was something you were on the lookout for on a going-forward basis.
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: I’ll tell you, Tayo, I think Austin certainly has had a fair amount of supply. It seems like it is abating in the suburban submarkets. It’s still there. It’s heavier in the core. We’ve been encouraged honestly. We mentioned Raleigh and Austin as our worry beads at the beginning of the year. And Austin has held up, I think, a little better than we expected and is trending stronger for the second half of the year. And just encouraged with where it is right now, and where our assets are located.
Tayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks Tayo.
Operator: We’ll now take a question from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.
David Bragg – Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Can you please share the year-over-year revenue growth for the legacy MAA and CLP portfolios in 2Q?
Albert M. Campbell III: Yes. I can tell you, Dave, there was a about a 20 basis points difference. So, overall I believe, on legacy MAA was about 2.5%. I think legacy Colonial was about 2.7% for the second quarter. We have a little more larger markets, and there’s obviously some things we’re trying to do to capture.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Little more larger markets in CLP portfolio.
Albert M. Campbell III: Yes.
David Bragg – Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that. And thanks for all the insight on the occupancy and secondary market issues that proved to be challenging in the second quarter. But what I’m kind of taking away from this conversation this morning is that there was also – what played a big role was a temporary challenge in your reporting and forecasting systems due to the integration. I’m just wondering if that’s a fair assessment when we think about the 3.4% to 4.4% second quarter revenue growth forecast you put out there at NAREIT in early June, versus where you ended up. Is that really a pretty big part of this that we’re not as focused on this morning?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: I would tell you that it’s certainly part of it. I mean, just be honest with you, clearly there was a lot of work going on in the second quarter regarding systems integration and training and just, as you can imagine, putting together two $4 billion platforms and getting everybody sort of on the same page, and really hitting an apex, frankly, in the month of May. And there was some challenge to it, no doubt about it. But I would tell you – and so obviously, we came up short on revenues relative to what we had expected. Now, we actually did a bit better than we expected on expenses. So while NOI still came up short because of the miss on the revenues, NOI miss was not a significant as based on what we were thinking going into NAREIT. But having said all that, as Tom alluded to a moment ago, it’s all done. We’re all on the same platform now. The teams are working very, very well together. The integration is complete. We’ve got great visibility into everything that’s happening at this point and feel very good about the outlook for the back half of the year.
David Bragg – Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that. And could you just summarize for us the changes to your expense growth expectations specific to the second half of the year?
Albert M. Campbell III: Yes, Dave, this is Al. I’d tell you, as we talked about, we had always expected the best expense performance being the third quarter, you got several things going on. You got the favorable comparison from some of the [noise] (ph) in Colonial’s numbers last year in the third quarter that we always had forecasted. A couple changes though. We did have some favorable performance in our expenses, I mentioned personnel, R&M, in the second quarter and we expect some of that. That’s capturing some of the synergies and savings from the platform. We expect that to continue into the back half of the year. And then also, we got very favorable insurance renewal, 20%, 15%, (indiscernible) that will take the back half of the year and the real estate tax comparisons get better. So my point being, third quarter will be by far the best expense performance and likely will be flat to negative, slightly negative. And the fourth quarter will be more of a modest, reasonable growth rate, averaging to much lower for the back half and the front half.
David Bragg – Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Okay, thank you. And one more for Eric. Eric, when you say that this integration is all done, do you also feel as though the organization is prepared for another sizeable portfolio opportunity should one present itself? Or is it too early?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: We’re absolutely ready. We have learned so much over the past year, Dave, I can’t begin to tell you. And our team has done just a tremendous job. And we’ve learned a lot through the process. We’ve got, I think, a great platform in place. And there’s not many challenges that we’re not prepared to take on at this point.
David Bragg – Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Okay. And throughout this process, you’ve spoken a lot about your desires in terms of large and secondary market exposure. What are your broad thoughts on an opportunity that could make the portfolio meaningfully more urban and younger within your existing markets?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Younger is good. I’m not hung up on the idea that our asset base needs to become increasingly urban-oriented, particularly in this region of the country. This region of the country tends to support a lot of employment and entertainment and good places to live that are not in the urban areas, and more in the suburban locations. So younger is good. Newer is good. We would continue to like very much the large markets that we’re in. As I’ve alluded to, I think we need to cycle more into some better growth secondary markets, which we certainly are working to accomplish over the next couple of years. But we like a good mix of urban and suburban.
David Bragg – Green Street Advisors, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And I’m showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Eric Bolton for any closing comments.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.:  No comments from us. I appreciate everyone joining our call and I’m sure we’ll see everybody starting of September. So thanks.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect at any time.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating in the MAA first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. At this time, we would like to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin, sir.
Tim Argo: Thank you, Keith. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO, Al Campbell, our CFO and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out, that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to us at this time. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website. We undertake no obligation to update any information discussed on this conference call. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. First quarter results were ahead of the midpoint of our guidance as operating performance came in a little better than we expected and G&A costs were lower. As outlined in our earnings release, given the better than expected Q1 result, we have increased our forecast of core FFO and AFFO performance for the year. During the quarter, we captured steady growth in effective rent per unit, increasing 3.2% across the combined same store portfolio when compared to the prior year, which is consistent with the preceding fourth quarter's performance. Our large market segment of the portfolio continues to out-perform at this point in the cycle capturing 4.0% growth in effective rent per unit. Our strongest performances in rent growth came from Houston, Austin and Atlanta. Rent growth in Memphis, Little Rock and Huntsville lagged within our secondary markets and weighed on revenue performance for that segment of the portfolio. Physical occupancy at quarter-end was a solid 95.5%, a 50 basis point decrease from the 96% posted at the same time last year. Resident turnover declined 7% during the quarter when compared to last year and remains low at 56.8% on a rolling 12-month basis. During the quarter, move-outs to buy a house declined by a significant 16% from prior year and constituted 18% of our total turnover. As we head into the spring leasing season, rent growth is increasing and we are encouraged with the trends. During April, rents for new move-in residents increased by an average of 3.1% on a year-over-year basis and lease renewals for renewing residents increased 7.1%. As Al will touch on, our largest line item expense pressure in operating expenses was property taxes, up 9.8% in Q1. While still early, we continue to believe that real estate taxes will increase in the range of 6% to 7% for the year. Based on first quarter trends and our outlook for the rest of the year, we remain comfortable with our earlier guidance calling for combined same store NOI growth in the 4% to 5% range for all of 2014. During the quarter construction wrapped up on our Randall Lakes property in Orlando with pre-leased occupancy currently standing at 55%. We expect to stabilize occupancy here in the first quarter of next year. We expect to wrap up construction on two other projects this quarter, our Lake Mary property expansion in Orlando and the South End property in Charlotte. Leasing continues to go well and in line with our forecasts at both properties. Of the 2,200 units we currently have under development or lease-up, we expect to have 2,000 of these units productive by year end and fully contributing to core FFO growth in 2015. The transaction market remains very competitive with the only acquisition completed during the quarter associated with our planned buy-out of the joint venture we had in place. We have two properties remaining in our JV and we expect to close on the acquisition of one of these properties this second quarter and we are currently under contract to sell the other property. During the quarter we closed on the disposition of one other apartment property and are currently marketing for sale another eight properties, including the JV asset just mentioned. We are finding a high level of interest and continue to feel good about achieving our planned dispositions in the range of $125 million to $175 million. In addition to these apartment property dispositions, as previously outlined, we are proceeding with the disposition of the remaining commercial properties acquired in our merger with Colonial. We made good progress in the first quarter with commercial properties now constituting less than 1% of our total gross assets. We are actively working on several other transactions and expect to be largely complete with this effort by year end. Our management team continues to make terrific progress in completing the remaining integration activities surrounding our merger with Colonial. We expect to have the property management software integration complete in the next month. Accounts payable, financial reporting, payroll and all the other key system consolidation activities have been completed. Our team has worked hard to complete these integration efforts before we get to the busy summer leasing season and they have done a terrific job. I really appreciate all the hard work. I am confident that we are now well positioned to begin executing on the various opportunities that we have previously identified surrounding our merger and look forward to capturing more efficiency and enhanced margins over the next several quarters. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments and will now turn the call over to Al.
Al Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. I will provide some additional commentary on the company's first quarter earnings performance, some balance sheet activity for the quarter and finally on updated earnings guidance for the year. FFO for the quarter was $97.4 million, or $1.23 per share. Core FFO, which excludes non-routine items, primarily merger & integration costs, was $95.6 million or $1.21 per share, which was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of guidance provided. About half of the favorable performance compared to our forecast came from property operating results, as both the same store and the non-same store portfolios slightly outperformed. The remaining favorability came from lower than projected G&A costs, as bonuses, health insurance and professional fees were all below projections for the quarter. The combined same store portfolio NOI grew 2.6% for the quarter, based on 3.1% growth in revenues, which was produced by the 3.2% growth in effective rents. Property operating expenses increased 3.9% for the quarter with over two-thirds of this increase coming from real estate taxes which grew 9.8% over the prior year. Our forecast, as Eric mentioned, for real estate tax expense growth for the full year remains at 6% to 7%, with the first quarter comparison impacted by prior year credits and the timing of accrual adjustments during the prior year. During the first quarter, we acquired the remaining two-thirds interest in two communities from Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, our legacy MAA joint venture, for $38.8 million and we assumed loans totaling $31.7 million. We also closed on the sale of one multifamily community located in Columbus, Georgia, for gross proceeds of $10.6 million, which produced a gain of $5.5 million recorded during the first quarter. As mentioned in the release, during the first quarter, we sold two operating commercial assets acquired with the Colonial merger, Brookwood Village Mall and CC Brookwood Village, an office asset, for a combined $80 million in gross proceeds. Also, during the first quarter, we sold five commercial land parcels acquired with the Colonial merger for combined gross proceeds of about $3.3 million. The company recorded total gains of $3.1 million during the first quarter related to the sale of these commercial and non-core assets we acquired from Colonial. Construction and lease-up of our development pipeline continued to progress well. We funded an additional $16 million of development costs during the first quarter and fully completed one community, Randal Lakes, in Orlando, Florida. We now have four communities, totaling 999 units, under construction, with $47.3 million of projected funding remaining to complete this development. We also had four communities in lease-up at the end of the quarter with an average occupancy of 66%. Three of the remaining lease-up communities and two of the development communities are now expected to stabilize during 2014 with the remaining communities in lease-up and construction expected to stabilize in 2015. Our balance sheet remains in great position. At the end of the first quarter, company leverage, based on market cap, was 39% and based on gross assets, was 41.8%, which is 190 basis points below the prior year. And perhaps more important is that at quarter-end, total debt was only 6.2 times recurring EBITDA and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.6 times, both comparing well to the multifamily peer group. At the end of the quarter, 97% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates for an average of about four years. Since year-end, we have executed $250 million of interest rate swaps to effectively lock a portion of the interest rate on future financing transactions, which we expect to further increase the duration of our interest rate protection. At quarter end, MAA's unencumbered asset pool was 63.9% of gross assets, and we had about $618 million of cash and credit available under our unsecured line of credit. Finally, based on first quarter performance, we are increasing our core FFO guidance for the full year by $0.04 per share at the midpoint. We now project core FFO to be between $4.84 and $5.04 for the year. Quarterly core FFO per share is expected to be $1.15 to $1.27 for the second quarter, $1.19 to $1.31 for the third quarter and $1.21 to $1.33 for the fourth quarter. Core AFFO for the full year is now expected to be $4.09 to $4.29 per share, which represents about a 70% dividend payout at the midpoint. That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Keith, I will turn the call over to you for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Eric Bolton: Good morning, David.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald: Just a couple of small questions. First, what's left on the Colonial integration in terms of, I guess in two dimensions, one, internal systems and operations and staffing, and two, costs?
Tom Grimes: Hi, David, it's Tom. Really, the large thing on systems is the conversion of legacy CLP communities over to the Yardi system. That is largely done. We have four of our five operating divisions converted and the fifth one tees up for us in May. And so we will be all on one system starting June 1. And then on the people side of it, we have really overhauled the commission structure, the pay structures and largely we are in good shape there. No other changes coming.
Al Campbell: I will just following him quickly on the costs. As you saw in the release, we estimate about $9 million to 10 million remaining for the full year. First quarter, we had about $6 million of that, and we still feel like that $9 million to $10 million is a good range for the year. We will probably end up at the top end of that. Probably more weighted toward remaining integration costs.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay, and then my second question has to do with revenue growth in aggregate in the secondary markets in the quarter, 1.9%. It was probably a little bit more muted than I would have expected at this point in the cycle for those types of markets. What are your thoughts around the dynamics of that growth rate? What you are seeing in the revenue management system relative to occupancy balance? What's really behind that 1.9% number in your mind?
Tom Grimes: David, I think it is, at this point in the cycle, though, larger markets tend to be more affected by supply and the secondary markets more by jobs creation. We think 2014 is going to be a much improved year for jobs improvement. However if you notice, the first quarter numbers, weather both precipitation here and cool in the northern half of our portfolio slowed job growth a little bit. But I think that's the key thing that we need going forward. We are optimistic we will see it later on in 2014.
Eric Bolton: If you look at the ratios of the job growth to supply, the numbers are still pretty compelling for the secondary market segment as a whole. As I mentioned, the segment, frankly, weighted down a little bit by Memphis' performance. Memphis, the market here, just the job market here, just really hasn't shown much recovery but I think that we think as the beginning of the latter part of year, we will see better performance out of Memphis. Columbus, Georgia was another market where we got a large property, a little over 1,000 units there that weighed on performance for that segment. But we think that broadly speaking, we will see some left later this year, but we have always - - this is still what I would consider to be a pretty healthy portion of the cycle for apartment fundamentals in the secondary markets relative to our large markets. We will always continue to struggle, keep up just a little bit but I think we will see that GAAP begin to narrow later this year.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay, and then just my final question on that theme, Eric, is with regard to Atlanta, which is still posting pretty good numbers despite lots of concerns around supply. Would you say that those markets are benefiting from the strong employment growth still or are there other factors there at work?
Eric Bolton: I think Atlanta's market's land is pretty good just as the job growth there is.
Tom Grimes: However, (inaudible) on jobs there and renewals there are going out. We are getting healthy rent growth rate with renewals at almost 8% and new leases frankly doing a little bit better than that at almost all 11%. So Atlanta, we are pretty optimistic on going forward.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay. Thanks for the detail.
Operator: Then we will take our next question from Ryan Bennett with Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead.
Ryan Bennett - Zelman and Associates: Hi. Good morning, guys. Just following up on your comments on April's new move-in and renewal trends. I am just curious what you are seeing or what you are sending out on renewals over the next couple of months now?
Eric Bolton: Yes. Sure. Renewals are going out at for April, they went out at 7.4%, May 7.9%, June 8% and July 8.2%.
Ryan Bennett - Zelman and Associates: Got it, and then just digging on the market level and looking at Raleigh in particular here in the quarter, kind of what has been the momentum during the first quarter and into April? What do you expect there in the peak leasing season?
Eric Bolton: Yes. Raleigh is one who had -- you have got to back up to the second half last year, when Raleigh, where they had jobs to completions in 2013 were roughly 3:1 and most of that was backended. So we are working off a little bit of a supply hangover. It improves in this year to more of a 7:1 ratio, which is healthy but we need to work through those. New lease rates are up about 1.2%. But renewals are hanging there at 6%. So I think Raleigh will be under pressure for a little while and work itself out of it later in the year.
Ryan Bennett - Zelman and Associates: Got it. Thanks. And one last question, just on the redevelopment front. Are you guys still on track in terms of the Colonial assets that you had positioned for redevelopment later this year?
Eric Bolton: Yes, absolutely. We are feeling good about that. We have got all the properties scoped. We have got units executed in our markets. We have got an additional, to what was in the release, an additional 400 units in process. This I would really expect to ramp up as we move into the busier summer season where we have more lease expiration sitting and where we are right on target there. Very excited about that.
Ryan Bennett - Zelman and Associates: Okay, great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: And we will take the next question from Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Eric Bolton: Hi, Paula.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: I wanted to ask a question about the expected synergies with the CLP integration. Would you say, Eric, that you are realizing those synergies either faster or more strongly than you had anticipated?
Eric Bolton: I wouldn't say it's any faster than what we expected. I will say that we think that the opportunity is bigger than what we initially had thought, particularly as Tom was just alluding to some of the redevelopment opportunity, but we really believe that on the revenue side, some of the opportunities surrounding management of LRO and how we go about that, I think we really need to get into the busy summer leasing season to really begin to see a lot of that benefit come through. And as we get into Q3 and Q4 in particular, that's where we think we will see some opportunities more reflected in the numbers. On the expense side, I think that it's about like we expect a lot of the contracts, a lot of the rework of things that we identified early on have been completed. What we really are shooting to do it get this final step completed with the systems integration which we will wrap up this month. I think from that point just everything becomes a little bit easier from an executions perspective. So we really think that as get in to the good busy summer season in the back after this year, which is what we have always expected, we always expected a bit of a ramp up to take place this year and that certainly continues to be what we are experiencing.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Thanks. And any further thoughts about the Vegas portfolio?
Tom Grimes: No, we need to get it a little fuller. To be honest with you, Paula, I think we have got opportunity there. We have got a good team in place but we have got one property that's holding us back a little bit that needs to be addressed.
Eric Bolton: In terms of your questions, broader in terms of our continued desire to stay and so forth. Frankly we are going to just continue to monitor that market this year. We are not of any mind to do anything different. Not looking to add there at this moment, but we certainly like the two assets that we have got. As Tom mentioned, we think that there is an opportunity, from an operating perspective, that we are going to address over the course of this year and we will probably make a decision later this year as to what we want to do there going forward.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Great. Thanks. And then just finally, I wanted to dig in a little bit to your comment, Eric, about the move-outs to home ownership dropped significantly. Were the trends there pretty even across your markets? Or were there some markets that really jumped out at you?
Eric Bolton: Paula, it was surprisingly even, frankly I was spending some time reviewing that and it's the same in primary as it is in secondary, or they are large as it is in secondary and there is no one market driving it. It is really across the board in the quarter.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thanks. That's all I have.
Operator: We will take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: Hi. Good morning out there.
Eric Bolton: Good morning.
Tom Grimes: Hi, Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: Would you guys talk a bit about the development lease-ups? The projects appear to be leasing up a bit ahead of expectations, which looks like some of the reasons for the upside this quarter. Can you talk a bit about the market demand and also if any concessions are involved?
Eric Bolton: Haendel, I would say, we are on track in aggregate and really right where we want to be as far as pricing goes. I mean we plan for concessions and the markets and we are on target for those pricing goals, just to get us leased up. You may have noticed the Northern Virginia properties, we just pushed back a little bit on the quarter of stabilization by quarter, and the way we look at that is we expect three months over 90 days occupancy to consider it exposed. So honestly if you miss by one day, by one unit, you push back. I don't think there is anything to worry about in that area. We are right on track on that.
Tom Grimes: I would tell you in recap, Fredericksburg is a little sluggish, Charlotte is doing better than we expected, the Orlando properties are right on targets, on balance. It is reconciling to pretty much what we had expected.
Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you for that. Could you also talk a bit more about the eight properties, Eric, you mentioned you are marking them for sale. Are you marking them individually? As a group? Are there any portfolio buyers out there and would you consider perhaps selling them sooner for maybe a little less to move back, getting them done quicker?
Eric Bolton: Well, I mean, I will certainly say, we have seen a ton of interest. We have got one group that we been talking with that was interested in several of them but, by and large, we have found the best execution to occur sort of selling retail as opposed to looking for a wholesale buyer and we ultimately believe we harvest the best value that way. But high level of interest situation in which we are selling one in Macon, Georgia year. We had a huge level of interest, 20 some odd bids came in with a number of them, nine to 10 of them, at better than what we were expecting. So it's a pretty healthy market out there and we feel comfortable with the volume that we have got. Obviously, we are trying to remain sensitive to thinking about the balance sheet and coverage ratios and of course we were working recycling out of a lot of commercial properties this year as well, which has a fairly dilutive impact. So I think we feel pretty good about the volume that we have gotten teed up this year. We probably will see them sell a little faster than we expected over the course of this year, but we are pretty optimistic with what we have been seeing in the way of interest.
Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: Following up on that. I don't know if you disclose or if you are willing to, but can you discuss perhaps some of the markets, some of the nature of the assets? Are they more legacy Mid-America, Colonial, the older assets? Can you talk a bit more about any general commentary on the state of the eight assets?
Eric Bolton: They are a mix of both large and secondary markets and they are mix of both legacy MAA and legacy CLP. Frankly, our approach is simply to take those assets that we believe that we are seeing generating the sort of the lowest AFFO operating margin that we have in the portfolio and looking to recycle that capital into more productive investments. It's the same approach we have been taking for the last couple of years. So when we completed our merger with Colonial, we put the entire portfolio together and peeled off the bottom 10 or so that we felt like had the lowest margin growth prospects associated with it. Again, it's AFFO after CapEx and typically what that translates into are obviously older assets. So average age is going to be 20, 25 years old, in some cases even older. As it so happens, a lot of the history, particularly on the legacy MAA side, the way this company was formed grew, a lot of the older assets tend to be in some of the more tertiary markets within the secondary market component of the portfolio. So that just happens to be where we are seeing more disposition activity occur. But on balance, I would say, probably at this point of what we are selling 60% or so of it is coming out of secondary markets and the balance out of the larger markets. It is all older and that's the profile.
Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: Okay and one more if I may. Can you talk a bit about the multifamily financing environment from the agency's and bank's perspective? There had been some talk of fears that Fannie and Freddie were potentially going to curtail here a bit, but they recently conveyed the desire to be leaders in financing here, in light of the heightened competition from banks, LifeCos, et cetera. Can you talk a bit about that?
Eric Bolton: I would tell you that what we are selling and talking to the buyers, both agencies are pretty active and we are seeing, particularly, Freddie being pretty active and they are -- I know a lot the buyers, again, that we are talking with are talking to both agencies and finding a lot of receptivity to their financing needs.
Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Jeff Gaston with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead. Jeff Gaston, your line is open. Please check your mute function.
Jeff Gaston - KeyBanc Capital: Good morning, guys.
Eric Bolton: Hi, Jeff.
Jeff Gaston - KeyBanc Capital: I was wondering if you could provide a little detail about the split between the legacy Mid-America portfolio performance versus the Colonial Properties? And also, do you still expect a list from the Colonial Properties in the second half?
Tom Grimes: Yes. A short answer is yes to both. We did see a little stronger revenue performance in the legacy CLP side, primarily driven by improvements in fees and delinquency and reimbursement. So that was relatively quick and we do feel like, as Eric mentioned earlier, there is an opportunity for us as we move into the year to smooth out some of the volatility that occurred around the merger in terms of occupancy and we feel like there is a repricing opportunity going forward.
Jeff Gaston - KeyBanc Capital: Great, and then you saw pretty significant outperformance as far as G&A and the property management expenses in 1Q. Could you give us a sense of what the proper run rate for the year would be?
Al Campbell: Yes this is Al, Jeff. I would say, we had a little favorability in it in the first quarter about $0.01 per share that we talked about, but that was a few items that were bonuses we talked about, health insurance and professional fees were a little lower in the first quarter than we thought. I think the run rate, with the projections for the full year, we took it down about $1 million, if you saw in our guidance and that's about right for full-year. So I think the run rate was pretty close, a little lower than we had started with in our guidance last quarter.
Jeff Gaston - KeyBanc Capital: Could you give us a sense as far as what it might be for G&A versus the property management?
Al Campbell: Really, I don't have that. We typically project that in total in the portfolio. Let me see if I can pull that detail for you. It has got to be pretty close to the run rate that we had in the first quarter in terms of the split. It's a pretty representative split, is what I am saying.
Jeff Gaston - KeyBanc Capital: Okay. All right. That's helpful. That is all my questions. Thanks a lot guys.
Al Campbell: Thanks. Jeff.
Operator: We will take our next question from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Hi. Good morning, guys. First question, just, Eric, the lease numbers, the renewal and new lease numbers you gave, were those lease-over-lease or those year-to-date, I mean, year-over-year?
Eric Bolton: Well, the way we give our numbers, when we talk about new lease rates, that's year-over-year, because it really supports and drives the overall revenue performance. So new lease rates being up in April, 3.1%, that's year-over-year. When we talk about renewals, we are talking about what's the rent increase we gave our existing customer. So it's really more of a lease-over-lease, if you will. So the 7:1 that I quoted for April was the existing customers who stayed with us by paying 7.1% more.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Anything on the other income side pushing through this year that we should expect above trend growth?
Eric Bolton: No, not really. Not that I can point to right now. All the other associated fees and so forth are performing pretty much in line with what we expected.
Al Campbell: There are some, obviously, in fees and other things related to the synergies and opportunities we expect in the Colonial portfolio as a part of that.
Eric Bolton: We got that all built it up in our forecast.
Al Campbell: Built in our forecast. Yes.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. That's helpful. Second question. Al, it looked like you had some good success on the land sale front there. Obviously, one of the components to driving that accretion, you guys have talked about, is eliminating the non-income producing assets. Of the land that sits there today, how much do you expect you can move in 2013 at this point versus how much is going to take a little bit more blocking and tackling in 2015 and 2016?
Al Campbell: Majority of the dispositions this year were from operating commercial, Mike. We focus on that first, as we talked about and we had about $150 million in dispositions in total, about $130 million or so of that is expected to be the commercial, which we did $80 million in the first quarter as you saw. So we expect a little bit more of the remaining of the year. So I think what you will see is us have a lot more focus on those land parcels in 2015 and 2016 as we move forward.
Tom Grimes: I would tell you, Mike, that roughly, call it 35% to 40% of it is multifamily related sites and we think that that will get pushed through reasonably quickly. I would say, likely before the end of the year. Some of the other is a little bit more difficult. It's remaining retail outparcels. There is a single-family component of parcel down in Gulf Shores that's fairly sizable that will probably take a little more time. I think that, well, the lion's share will be gone by the end of this year, I expect but what's left will probably take a couple of years.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Al, still expecting the bond offering mid-year?
Al Campbell: That's our plan. It will depend on the balance sheet for that, obviously. As you can see, we have about $450 million in debt maturities about midyear. So our plan now is if things go well, assess the public markets and take care of that and good news is, we have seen very good market activity over the last few months. So our expectations for rate have actually improved a little bit since the fourth quarter. So we look forward to that.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, and finally Eric, you touched upon the acquisition market being a bit more challenging. A lot of competition. Can you just talk about pricing in the primary versus secondary markets and any changes you had seen in the last, call it, 90 days?
Eric Bolton: There has really been a lot of change in the last 90 days. It is still very intense. We are seeing assets of the kind of quality that we are looking to buy, trading 4.5% to 5% in some of the larger markets, and frankly not much higher than that in some of the secondary markets in which we are still buying in, Charleston and San Antonio and Jacksonville and some of these other markets. We are still seeing newer assets very much in the 5% to 5.25% range. So I will put the spread at maybe 25, perhaps as much as 50 basis points, but broadly it's been that way for about the last year. So I think that with the fundamentals continue to remain fairly strong and of course rates being where they are, I think it's going to take a more significant rise in interest rates before you will see any really cap rate movement. The interest is pretty darn high right now.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: That's all from me, guys. Thank you.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: We will take our next question from Buck Horne with Raymond James and Associates. Please go ahead.
Buck Horne - Raymond James and Associates: Hi. Good morning, guys. I know this has been asked a little bit. You kind of danced around it. But I just want to understand the renewal numbers a little bit more clearly because it seems like those are really strong renewal growth targets that you guys are getting. Are you getting more aggressive with the price increases this spring? And how much is this change in the move-outs to buy a home affecting your desire to push pricing this spring?
Tom Grimes: Really the pricing decision on how aggressively push has less to do about what we think is happening in the home buying market and what our exposure and what are fundamentals are, and right now, they are good and we are with our yield management practices just jumping all over that. That's kind of the push point but repeat your question a little bit, I want to make sure I am staying on point. I got distracted by the home buying point.
Buck Horne - Raymond James and Associates: I am just wondering, combining the two data points, to me, is really striking that you saw such a sharp decline year-over-year in the move-outs, and you have got such strong and accelerating renewal notices going out. I am kind of wondering if the two are playing together? Or is there something just more structural about the Colonial portfolio that's allowing you to push pricing a little bit more aggressively? Just understanding.
Tom Grimes: Sure. It's a combination of both. Frankly, we feel pretty good about where the markets are going just in terms of overall supply and demand and where our exposure is at this point. Really, its more of a forward-look that we are making on those pricing that we have quoted, and I think they had a similar system, but with a different approach. In that we see the opportunity to do some repricing, and are taking advantage of that opportunity.
Eric Bolton: And I think, Buck, this is just following on with what Tom is saying. The performance is not really related in our way of looking at it and thinking about it to the reasons for move-out. As Tom mentioned, really, our approach to managing renewals is a function of, obviously looking at what the market is doing, looking at what our exposure is and that gets back to how you define your tolerance levels and how you operate LRO and we have always taken an approach to try to keep a lower level of volatility in terms of our exposure settings and the lower level of volatility as we get in from a lease expiration management perspective. What we think that that enables one to do is ultimately be a little bit more aggressive on pricing. So by taking some of the volatility that we felt like was existing within the former legacy CLP portfolio, we think that that's going to manifest itself in much more stronger pricing performance, particularly as we get into latter part of this year. That's where a lot of the lift comes from. It really has nothing to do with move-out reasons.
Buck Horne - Raymond James and Associates: I understood. Thank you. Secondly, I was wondering if you could drill down a little bit more on the Texas markets, and noting that there has just been such tremendous job growth and demand in Texas, but there is also quite a bit of new supply that is getting underway in most of the major markets but it seems like some of that supply maybe more concentrated in certain submarkets and I want to understand how you view the supply pressure in the Texas areas relative to your portfolio? Are you seeing any signs that supply is going to be more of an impact? Or is it a less of an impact in the Texas markets where you guys are positioned?
Tom Grimes: Sure, Buck, in Dallas and Houston, I think we feel very good about where those markets are and a ton of that construction coming on in Dallas is in the uptown market, which had limited exposure too. On the Austin front, we are really monitoring supply, but with the jobs engine has been able to absorb it pretty well in Austin and we are optimistic about how it's doing and it is 6% new lease growth and 8.6% on the renewals. So we are watching Austin and feel pretty good about Dallas and Houston.
Buck Horne - Raymond James and Associates: Thank you, guys.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Buck.
Operator: We will take our next question from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies: First question, just around Colonial and some of the questions that were asked earlier. In regards to the synergies, it does sound like things are moving along pretty well just from the cost perspective. Trying to understand the other pieces in regards to, again, not purchases in bulk, the ability to kind of push Colonial rent a little bit more aggressively versus what Colonial was doing before. How are those parts are kind of coming together, and when would we kind of expect to start to see the benefits of that showing up in the numbers?
Eric Bolton: I was talking to the guidance portion of it. I think what you see is, majority of that's built in the second and third quarter and the fourth quarter, Tayo because in terms of allowing the revenue side, you needed to see the lease come due and there has to be an opportunity there and have time to go through all the contracts. So if you look at the guidance, I think what you will see is, we had anticipated all along accelerated growth in both revenues and NOI in the second, third and in to the fourth quarter.
Tom Grimes: And then those almost the same thing on the expense side, Tayo. We are a business that does most of its volume over the next four months or so and the benefits of the way we have structured the company and the pricing opportunities that we have going and just sort of the efficiencies that we are driving in terms of how we turn units, those will begin to manifest themselves in mid-second and early third quarter.
Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies: Okay, that's helpful. Then just on the transactions that were done during the quarter. I may have missed it, but did you give any cap rate information on the commercial asset sales?
Al Campbell: We did. We can give it. We had 8.25%, 8.5% cap rate range on $80 million that we sold. You have got to understand there was that it was a mall asset and office asset there combined. And that's the combined cap rate. I think to say that the mall is older asset, it was probably higher cap rate, but they averaged.
Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies: Okay, that's helpful. Then the third question. Some of the smaller markets you are in where you only have one or two assets. I know there had been some conversation earlier on about potentially exiting those markets because of lack of synergies. Just kind of curious where that stands? And if we should be expecting some of that, going forward.
Eric Bolton: Tayo, this is Eric. Absolutely. I think, as I alluded to earlier, we are primarily driven by a desire to cycle capital where we believe the after CapEx AFFO margin likely is lower and likely to not be as strong going forward. It just so happens again that that happens to me and some of our more tertiary markets where we also happen to have some efficiency. So we will be exiting some more of markets this year. We exited a number of them last year. We think over the course, in due course, over the next couple of years as we continue this recycling effort targeting on the parameters that I described, a consequence of that will be fewer and fewer of these tertiary markets within the portfolio.
Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies: Have you specifically identified which markets you are going to get out of yet? Or are you still in the process of evaluating that?
Eric Bolton: Well, have identified what we are planning to sell this year, but beyond that we got it but we are not prepared to disclose that now, but you will more of that over the next couple years.
Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies: Great. Thank you. Good quarter.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Tayo.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We will take our next question from Dave Bragg with Green Street. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Dave Bragg - Green Street: Thank you. Good morning. Eric, I wanted to follow up on the comments that you made regarding the transaction market and the last three year observations of private market buyer underwriting, are they accepting or underwriting to lower IRRs than they were a couple of years ago? Or generally speaking, are they looking for the recent period of above average NOI growth to continue for the next few years?
Eric Bolton: Dave, it's hard to know for sure. My guess is that the IRR requirements, IRR expectations have moderated a little bit from where they were a couple years ago. I expect that's probably part of it. But where we find just huge levels of interest are some of the older assets where there is presumably an opportunity for some sort of value add or some sort of redevelopment play that that they can dial into their modeling and ultimately cobble together a higher forward-looking NOI performance and ultimately cobble together an IRR to be frankly, whatever it needs to be. So I think that these value add opportunities, these 10, 12 or even older 15, 20 year old assets offer just a lot of opportunity to get pretty creative in terms of how you think about creating value. So I think there is some of that going on, but I do believe that probably IRRs have moderated just a little bit but as I alluded to, we are seeing a huge level of interest and these are all very sophisticated buyers, lot of your institutional capital behind them and great track records of having closed a lot of transactions over the last couple of years.
Dave Bragg - Green Street: Thank you for that. Regarding your revenue growth guidance and perhaps you discussed this last quarter and we missed it, but when we look at the revenue growth guidance range of 3.5% to 4.5%, do you have the same expectations for the MAA and Colonial Portfolios? Or do you have higher expectations for one of the two
Eric Bolton: I will give you the summary. I would talk and give you some details on how, Dave, but I think obviously we have a little higher expectations for Colonial because we need to capture those synergies both in terms of pricing and capture stronger property performance to not repeat the volatility of last year. Some of the things we talked about in occupancy and pricing in the second, third quarter. So we clearly have a stronger expectation for Colonial portfolio.
Tom Grimes: I would echo that but it's an opportunity in price and occupancy in the third quarter, second and third quarter and then we have got further opportunities on both portfolios with fees and new opportunities, ideas that we have either added to the Colonial platform or brought from the Colonial platform to ours.
Dave Bragg - Green Street: Okay. So just roughly speaking, at the midpoint, would it be somewhere around 4.5% for Colonial and 3.5% for MAA? Or is it not that wide?
Eric Bolton: Probably not quite that wide but you are getting close to that range that we are taking. When you look at the overall guidance for the year, if we put out 3.1% in the first quarter and the midpoint is 4%, it is going to take something close to that to get that. So that's pretty close.
Tom Grimes: But the performance differential between the two is quite.
Eric Bolton: It's a 100 basis. I will call it more like 50 to 60 basis points.
Dave Bragg - Green Street: Understood. That's helpful. My last question is just very specific to the new move-in gains. We think about it slightly differently. What was the increase on new move-ins as compared to the tenant that departed?
Tom Grimes: Using Eric's numbers, it was 2.2%, Dave. So 3.1% on a year-over-year basis, 2.2% on a lease-over-lease for April new lease rate.
Dave Bragg - Green Street: Sorry, Tom. I was really looking for the first quarter.
Tom Grimes: Okay. The first quarter, it was 3% on a year-over-year basis and negative 1.1% on a quarter basis, being weaker in January and strengthening through March.
Dave Bragg - Green Street: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: I am showing no further questions. So I will turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.
Eric Bolton: No further comments from us. We will see everyone at NAREIT in a few weeks. Thanks for joining.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating in the MAA Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, we would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Wolfgang, Corporate Secretary. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin.
Leslie Bratten Cantrell Wolfgang: Thank you, Justin, and good morning, everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Corporate Secretary for MAA. With me this morning are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Tim Argo, SVP of Finance. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call, will be available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
H. Eric Bolton: Thanks, Leslie, and good morning. We appreciate everyone joining our call this morning. Core FFO for the fourth quarter of $1.20 per share was $0.06 per share better than we expected, with higher NOI performance and lower G&A cost driving the favorable result. Same-store physical occupancy at year-end was a solid 95% and put us in a good position heading into 2014. During the fourth quarter, the same-store rent per unit increased 3.2% as compared to the prior year. Resident turnover remains low, with the same-store portfolio posting a 5% decline compared to the prior year. Move-out associated with buying a home were consistent with the prior year, driving 21% of total move-outs, and move-outs associated with renting a house continue to be a nonfactor and remain low, driving only 6% of our total move-outs. As outlined in our 2014 guidance, we expect leasing conditions across the portfolio to remain healthy this year, with same-store revenues increasing 3.5% to 4.5%, occupancy holding steady and rent growth driving revenues. Looking at the latest forecast of new supply deliveries and job growth, we expect leasing fundamentals across our markets in 2014 will remain steady, as the ratio of new jobs to new supply is forecasted to be in the 8:1 range across our same-store portfolio. We expect to see our best performances in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix and Nashville. The ratio for our Secondary Markets segment of the portfolio continues to also suggest steady leasing conditions, with the ratio of new jobs to new supply improving slightly in 2014 to a ratio of 10:1. Our portfolio strategy has historically focused on an objective of achieving a balanced, or what we refer to as a full-cycle performance profile, with the goal of lessening some of the cyclicality in performance that is generally driven by new supply pressures. We believe that our newly merged portfolio with Colonial has enabled us to retain, and in fact, strengthen this objective. Our redevelopment program completed just over 2,500 units in 2013, and we generated, on average, an incremental 11% increase in rents. We're expanding the program this year as a result of our merger, and expect to complete redevelopment on approximately 4,000 units in 2014. Our expanded program this year will remain consistent with the parameters that we've been executing on for the past several years, with a focus on unit interior rehab and above-market rent increases in the 10% range. Leasing momentum continues to go well at our 4 lease-up properties, and we expect to have the entire pipeline stabilized by year -- midyear. In addition, construction continues to be on budget at our 5 new development properties, with our projects in Orlando and Charleston scheduled to complete construction this quarter. We expect to achieve stabilization on this new development pipeline starting late this year and into early 2015. While we're currently looking at a number of other new development projects, we expect future funding commitments associated with new development to moderate for MAA over the next year or 2. We instead prefer to be focused on sourcing opportunistic acquisition opportunities of new development at this point in the cycle. We continue to actively work on recycling capital from the remaining commercial properties and land assets acquired in our merger with Colonial. We completed the sale of the retail center Colonial Town Park in the fourth quarter and are currently negotiating sale contracts on 4 of the remaining 5 operating commercial properties. In addition, we remain committed to a program of steadily recycling capital from a number of older multifamily properties, closing on the sale of $131 million of apartment properties in 2013. We expect to increase our disposition program this year and are looking to sell approximately $150 million of apartment assets. In addition, as mentioned, we are also focused on continuing to recycle the non-core commercial and land assets from the former Colonial balance sheet, and as a result, expect to sell a little over $300 million of assets this year. And while the acquisition market remains very competitive, I'm hopeful that one of the outcomes from the increase in new development activity in a number of markets is more opportunities to opportunistically add new properties to the portfolio later this year and into 2015. We've targeted $250 million in new acquisitions this year, with approximately $60 million of this associated with our planned buyout of our partners' interest in our joint venture Mid-America Fund II. Merger integration activities continue to go well, and we're making great progress on establishing a fully consolidated operating and reporting platform. Thus far, our team has completed the conversion and consolidation of all payroll human resource systems, general ledger and accounts payable. We're now underway with the conversion to a common property management system and expect to have this important process completed by early summer. As we capture full consolidation of our operating and pricing systems, we remain confident in the opportunities to be captured from higher efficiency and scale. Now I want to also express my thanks and appreciation to all our folks who have been working so hard to ensure we were in a position to operate and execute as a combined platform in 2014. We still have more integration work to do, and I believe some great opportunity to capture later this year and into 2015. But we're off to a terrific start. And I appreciate the hard work and success thus far. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. And I'm going to turn the call over to Al.
Albert M. Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's fourth quarter earnings performance, the balance sheet activity for the quarter, and then finally, on our initial earnings guidance for 2014. As we outlined in the release, given the October 1 close of the Colonial merger, fourth quarter results reflect a full quarter of combined activity, with year-to-date results representing 3 quarters of MAA stand-alone activity and 1 quarter of combined operation. Core FFO for the fourth quarter, which excludes nonroutine items, primarily the merger and integration costs, was $95 million or $1.20 per share, which was $0.06 per share above the midpoint of previous guidance provided. And about 1/3, or $0.02 per share, of this favorable performance was produced by the combined same-store portfolio, primarily favorable operating expenses, and the remaining 2/3, or $0.04 per share, was produced by favorable G&A and interest expense combined, mainly related to merger activities. The combined same-store portfolio NOI grew 3.5% for the quarter based on 3.2% growth in revenues, which was produced by 3.2% growth in effective rent. And operating expenses grew 2.8% for the quarter, despite pressure from a 7% growth in real estate taxes, which are about 1/4 of our total operating expenses. The legacy MAA and Colonial portfolios performed essentially in line during the fourth quarter, with the Colonial portfolio operating expenses benefiting in Q4 from the initial savings on combining the insurance programs, which produced about a 60 basis points expense growth improvement for the quarter. As mentioned in the release, we acquired one recently developed community located in Fredericksburg, Virginia, during the quarter, for $45.2 million, and sold one older community located in LaGrange, Georgia, for $10.4 million. These transactions bring our year-to-date acquisition volume to $129.2 million, including the remaining interest of joint venture communities acquired, and our disposition volume to $131.3 million total for the year. Following the end of the quarter, we acquired the remaining 2/3 interest in 2 communities from the Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, our remaining legacy MAA joint venture, for $38.8 million, and we assumed loans totaling $31.7 million. Also, following the end of the quarter, we closed on the sale of a community located in Columbus, Georgia, for gross proceeds of $10.6 million. This sale completed our disposition plans originally projected to all close in 2013. Construction and lease-up on our development pipeline continued to progress well. We funded an additional $25 million toward our multifamily development pipeline during the fourth quarter. We now have 5 communities, totaling 1,461 units under construction, with $68.5 million remaining to complete them. We also have 4 communities remaining in lease-up at the end of the year, with average occupancy of about 82%. And 2 of the communities are expected to stabilize during the first quarter, and the remaining 2 are expected to stabilize during the second quarter. Following the merger with Colonial, our balance sheet remains strong and flexible. And during the fourth quarter, we completed our inaugural bond offering, issuing $350 million in 10-year unsecured notes, and we successfully exchanged $392 million or 87% of the outstanding Colonial public bonds for MAA notes, leaving $742 million of total MAA public bonds outstanding at year-end. This exchange eliminates redundant in cost-reporting requirements, and the increased volume of bonds outstanding through MAA's operating partnership is expected to enhance investor liquidity. At year-end, 62% of our assets at costs are encumbered, 48% of our debt is unsecured, and 97% of our debt is fixed or hedged against rising interest rates, with maturities laddered well over the next few years. Our leverage was 42.4%, based on gross assets, and our coverage ratios also remain very strong, with total interest coverage of 3.4x and fixed charge coverage of 3.6x for the quarter based on recurring EBITDA. And at year-end, we had $586 million of cash and credit available under our line of credit. Finally, we are providing initial guidance for 2014 with the release. There will be some continued noise related to the merger and importing earnings for 2014, so we're giving guidance on a core FFO basis, which does exclude merger-related and other nonroutine items, really with the goal of providing more clarity and comparability to prior periods. We also added a fair amount of detail in our supplemental schedules with the press release to help model the company performance. Core FFO for 2014 is projected to be $4.80 to $5 per share, which is $4.90 at the midpoint, based on projected average shares of about 79.1 million. And as we expected, core FFO for 2014 is impacted by the initial dilution from the non-productive development pipeline and land parcels acquired from Colonial -- from the Colonial merger, along with the continued recycling of commercial multifamily assets, as Eric mentioned. As previously discussed in our investor presentations, we believe there's a combined $0.30 to $0.45 per share of additional earnings to capture over the next few years beyond the $25 million of stated synergies that we've been discussing. And we continue to bring the Colonial assets to the same productive level, our balance sheet will capture these over the next couple of years. Core FFO per share is expected to range between $1.12 to $1.24 in the first quarter and between $1.18 and $1.30 for the remaining 3 quarters of 2014. The primary driver of 2014 performance is expected to be continued, steady NOI growth from our same-store portfolio. Our estimate includes full-year, same-store NOI from the combined portfolio of 4% to 5%, based on a 3.5% to 4.5% growth in revenues and a 3% to 4% growth in operating expenses. We generally expect continued strong pricing performance and stable occupancy levels through the year. We expect real estate taxes to be a continued area of pressure on operating expenses, projected to increase 6% to 7% for 2014. We expect to be net sellers in 2014, with acquisition volume projected to range $200 million to $300 million for the year, and disposition volume, in total, commercial and multifamily, to range $250 million to $300 million for the year. We also plan to fund an additional $65 million to $70 million toward completion of the current development pipeline. Total overhead, consisting of property management and G&A cost combined, is expected to range between $55 million and $57 million for the full year, with the full $25 million of projected synergies -- stated synergies captured by year end on a run-rate basis. Total combined transaction costs related to the merger are expected to be $55 million to $60 million in total, including $32.5 million incurred by MAA in 2013 and $18.5 million incurred premerger by Colonial. We expect to incur an additional $9 million to $10 million of combined merger and integration cost during 2014, and these transaction and integration costs are all in line with our original underwriting and expectations. Other key assumptions include plans to access the public bond market around midyear to refinance the $450 million in maturing debt. And given the current level of projected asset dispositions, our current expectations don't include the need for any new equity during the year. We expect total leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, to end the year between 42% and 45%. And that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Justin, I'll turn the call over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Just a couple of questions, Eric. Can you go into a bit more detail, if possible, on the sort of scope and the timing of the asset sales and specifically, what kind of valuations we could expect to see on some of those?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, we have roughly a little over $150 million of commercial assets. These are operating assets that we picked up from the Colonial merger. And the values, I mean we're -- 4 of the 5 are under contract, we're in the market with the fifth one currently. But I probably shouldn't get into pricing specifically at this point, given sort of where we are in the process. But I can tell you that the pricing we have on all these are well within what we expected in our original underwriting and we feel good about the values and the pricing we're looking at now. What's important to keep in mind is that on these commercial assets, these are all assets that are going to be -- being office and retail, going to be selling at a much higher cap rate than what we're planning to reinvest in multifamily. So they are particularly dilutive as we cycle that capital, at least near term, but we certainly believe important to get back to our focus solely on apartment real estate. The other -- the balance of the plans for the year is roughly about $150 million-or-so of multifamily assets. We sold, as we mentioned, about $130 million last year. We think it's important to continue this steady process of cycling out of some of the older assets. And again, there's some dilution associated with that. It represents, really, about 11 or so properties that we've teed up for next year. And so that really is -- the spread on that is about 100 to 120 basis points is the assumption, in terms of the dilution associated with the recycling on the multifamily. But that hopefully gives you a little perspective, David.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Yes. And then -- and relative to the multifamily, can we expect some of the -- some of those assets to be in sort of the non-core markets, like South Florida, Vegas and so forth?
H. Eric Bolton: Yes. But frankly, what we're really -- it's not Vegas, I mean, is not targeted, neither is South Florida. I mean, frankly, what we're really targeting are the older and lower-margin investments that we have. And as it so happens, a lot of the older assets that we have are in some of the more tertiary markets in the portfolio. And so what you're going to likely see -- what you will see over the next couple of years is continued cycling out of some of the more tertiary markets. There'll be a few in some of the bigger markets like a Charlotte and a Dallas, but it's really driven more by a belief that we can reinvest the capital into higher yielding -- or higher margin, and higher -- longer term sort of value-creation investments and -- but I also want to quickly add though, as I've said in the past, we very much remain committed to this belief in allocating capital between large and secondary markets. So as we are more active in recycling within the Secondary Segment of the portfolio, it's really moving capital out of some of the more tertiary markets into other secondary markets. So it'll be moving out of Valdosta, out of Columbus, Georgia, markets like that into Charleston, Savannah, Greenville, Kansas City, some that we offer -- we believe offer a little bit more dynamic job growth.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Okay. And if I could just tack one more small question on, Al. Is there a subtext to some of this churn to lower overall leverage for the firm? Are you comfortable with current levels?
Albert M. Campbell: I would say, David, we're pretty comfortable right now with current leverage. But over time, we would expect to bring that in a little bit, as we continue to work through this process over the next couple of years. But we're in the 42% to 45% range right now. We'll probably stay at the low end of that and over the next couple of years, continue to go down. But for right now, we're comfortable.
H. Eric Bolton: And let me also just quickly add on that point, though, that I think it's important when you start to think about leverage levels and you look across the sector at various leverage levels, I think the balance sheet leverage and where the balance sheet -- and how the balance sheet is being managed, needs to reconcile to how the company -- what the company's overall strategy is. If we were a big developer, and we had a big development pipeline with a plan to continue a big future funding commitment to our strategy, I can tell you that I would be pushing to get our leverage much lower than it is right now. But as you know, that is not what we do. And so I think you have to reconcile your leverage and your balance sheet strategy to what you're trying to do overall as a company.
Operator: And we'll go next to Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Just curious, just based on your performance in the fourth quarter with occupancy loss in both the Mid-America and Colonial portfolio and then based on your comments that occupancy is staying roughly flat over the next year, I'm just curious, what are you expecting in terms of your rent growth trajectory for both your Large and your Secondary Markets in 2014?
Albert M. Campbell: I'll give you the overall blend. This is Al, Ryan. And I can tell you what we're expecting for the year. In terms of performance for the year, we're expecting pricing and -- occupancy to be stable, pricing to be about what it is, slightly moderated. First quarter carrying the fourth quarter trends in and then second and third quarter, beginning to have a little higher velocity because those are the high-traffic months. But for the year, the overall price performance, I think, a little less for the typical portfolio than we had this year. Now remember, in the guidance, we do have impact also from opportunities from the Colonial, from synergies and so for that portfolio, there's a little more than just a normal performance expected in revenues this year that does impact that top line.
Thomas L. Grimes: And Ryan, on the occupancy front, we don't look at that as an odd trade off on occupancy trending down a little bit from third quarter to fourth is normal seasonality, and we wouldn't expect it to stay flat at this point. We would expect it to grow over time across-the-board. And the -- so to say, it's important to draw distinction between the shift in the MAA portfolio and the shift in the Colonial portfolio. On the occupancy side, you've got to look past the actual ending physical occupancy and look at the average daily for the effective occupancy. For MAA it was 94.7% in the fourth quarter -- or in the third quarter, and moved down to 94.2%. Just a drop of a few basis points, which is perfectly seasonal. On the COP side, you really have to go back and look at the -- and look at their goal for the third quarter, which was to bring occupancy up from the mid-94% that it was at the beginning of the third quarter. They did that beautifully, but gave up a little bit of rent on that and probably overshot the mark. So they came into the fourth quarter with sub-7% 60-day exposure. And so their tradeoff was a little bit less. We expect occupancy to grow from this point forward, we're at 95.2% for January and in good shape on exposure.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Got it. I appreciate the color there. Al, just back to your point on the Colonial assets and the rent growth. Is that something that we can expect in the back half of the year, as you talked about those assets coming online with your revenue management system?
Albert M. Campbell: I think you can expect 2 things Ryan: one is, as Tom mentioned, in the second and third quarter, you have a very favorable comparison because when we started talking about the merger last June, there was a slip in occupancy in their portfolio in the second quarter. They worked hard in the third quarter to get it back, got it back, but there will be some favorable year-over-year in the second, some in the third quarter. And then in the third and fourth quarter, you will begin to see the impact of some of these synergies as some redevelopment program and some of these other things that we're doing begin to play through the portfolio. So more in the second, third and fourth quarter, you'll see that.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Got it. All right. And just to follow-up quickly, just on the redevelopment. In terms of your level of spend that you're expecting this year and how much of that will be, maybe, at the Colonial assets versus MAA?
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, we'll do -- Ryan, we'll do about 4,000 units and that is about doubling our current pipeline. And 2,000 of those units will be in the Colonial side. They did not have a similar program.
Albert M. Campbell: And for -- just to give you context about same cost level, which will put you in the 18 -- in the around $18 million, or $15 million to $20 million let's say, we'll spend for the full year, Ryan.
Operator: And we'll go next to Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just a couple of more questions on guidance, on the same-store revenue growth guidance that you have, can you just break it down -- what you're going -- expecting between the small versus the large markets and what you're expecting Colonial versus the Mid-America portfolio to do in 2014?
Albert M. Campbell: Karin, we really don't specifically breakdown between Large and Secondary on that, we do it property level build it up. I don't think that's something that we've typically want to really put out on our guidance. I'll say to you, we do expect the Large Markets in our projections to, as we talked about, have stable performance, but moderate a little bit and our Secondary Markets to tighten up a little bit, close that range a bit. Not to close it, I mean it's -- the gap is pretty large at this point. We do see some progress in 2014. But not the full gap close.
H. Eric Bolton: We do think, as Al says, I mean, we do think the Secondary Market component of the portfolio will be a stronger performance for us in '14 than it was in '13. Certainly the gap will begin to moderate a little bit. We look for this component of the portfolio to be a real stabilizing influence in our performance. And we certainly think that's going to be the case this year. On the other sort of part of your question regarding sort of the difference in '14 between the sort of legacy MAA and the legacy Colonial portfolio, we do think that the Colonial portfolio will outperform a little bit in '14 relative to MAA, only because of kind of the points that Al was mentioning earlier, we think that there is some opportunity on sort of the yield management side, particularly in Q2 and Q3, to do some things to address some of the things that took place last year in '13, not have those things repeat in '14, and we think on a net basis, that's going to ultimately drive a higher level of revenue result out of Colonial portfolio than it is out of MAA. But on a blended basis, you got the number there.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. Next question, on guidance. What is included in the core guidance, with respect to the mark-to-market adjustment?
Albert M. Campbell: The market-to-market (sic) [mark-to-market] adjustment was, in total, about $90 million, that we put in our balance sheet with the merger. And I think, what we have in our fourth quarter, is it $24 million, Tim? I think there is expected to be $24 million to $25 million for 2014. But I'll tell you, Karin, we are wanting to -- as we looked at 2014, this is the first time we're putting out guidance for the year, obviously. And as we looked at the projections, and analysts put out for '14 before we had this guidance out. It really was all over the place, and we were trying, we're trying very hard to give a lot of details in this call and in the supplements to help really focus and put everybody on the same page if we can. I'll say that to say, we are focusing on core FFO, which will exclude the merger cost and will exclude that fair market value adjustment. Now that is a favorable non-cash favorable adjustment that hits FFO -- NAREIT FFO, but we looked at it, since it's noncash, we thought the right thing to do for investors was to pull that out and just show core FFO without that. So we -- I will tell you, that's a number, it's going to be $24 million, $25 million this year, but we're going to exclude that in our core FFO.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: No. That's helpful. Can you just talk about -- I know you mentioned earlier that the cap rates on the dispositions, including -- especially the commercial sales, is going to be higher than what you're buying on the acquisition side. Without giving specific cap rates, can you just talk about what you think the spread will be on cap rates between dispositions and acquisitions this year?
Albert M. Campbell: On the commercial, you're talking 250 basis points, Karin. It's pretty -- because the Commercial they're -- they're higher, typically higher yielding, higher cap rate assets, so you're talking 250 basis points.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And on the multifamily that you're selling versus buying?
H. Eric Bolton: Probably about 100.
Albert M. Campbell: A little over 100.
H. Eric Bolton: Yes.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And just last question, you mentioned in your remarks that you prefer acquisitions over developments today. Can you just talk about why -- what you're seeing in sort of the environment and what causes you to feel that way?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, I think it really is just a realization that there's a lot of development in a number of these markets. It's coming online, particularly in the markets, a lot of these Sunbelt markets, a lot of this development is taking place by developers who are not really in the business of owning this product long term. And we've demonstrated a history. I mean, frankly, just -- we've had the opportunity to compare yields that we're getting on some of the development that we have in some cases prepurchased, or development that we have bought in a more opportunistic way and contrasted that against the yields that we're getting on the development that Colonial was doing. And I can tell you that the spreads, the yields are right on top of each other. And so from my perspective, particularly at this part of the cycle, where there's more supply coming into the market, we just feel, on a risk-adjusted basis, that we can bring brand-new product on to the balance sheet at yields and value that is equivalent to what the yields would be if we were building it ourselves. And, of course, we are not taking on the risk to do that. And so we just continue to believe that one of the ways that you sort of manage the balance sheet and manage long-term earnings in this region of the country is to be very -- in my mind, you really limit how much you want to do in development. In particular, this part of the cycle, you want to be more on the buying side as opposed to the development side.
Operator: And we'll go next to Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.
Gregory A. Van Winkle - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: This is actually Greg Van Winkle standing in for Haendel. First, just want to get a little more clarity on the Colonial merger synergies and how that's impacting your guidance for same-store NOI growth? Assuming there's some property level synergies baked into that 4% to 5% guidance you put out, could you quantify the impact of the synergies on that same-store NOI guidance for us?
Albert M. Campbell: I can, Greg. This is Al. And as we talked about, we expect some synergies, both in the revenue line and in the expense line. Probably a little more expense in 2014, call it, 60-40 split. We have somewhere in the $5 million to $6 million range, I think, that we expect to capture in the year related to that. And if you do the math and back into it, you're talking somewhere in the 75 to 100 basis points impact on the combined portfolio NOI performance, for the quarter -- I mean, for the year.
Gregory A. Van Winkle - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just one more, if I could. Could you give us a little color on what you're seeing in financing availability for the assets in the secondary and tertiary markets? We've been hearing that the financing environment is kind of drying up a little bit at the lower-quality end, which it sounds like it's mostly what you're selling. I just wanted to get your take on that.
H. Eric Bolton: Well, we haven't really seen any evidence of that. As mentioned, we just closed on the sale of a property in Columbus, Georgia. We were pretty active in the market up until third and fourth quarter of last year and all the deals that we had under contract, our sellers, often private capital sources, they were -- everything worked, I mean they got the financing. There was no real pushback or re-trade on anything. So certainly, having been out to the National Multifamily Housing Council's Annual Meeting a couple of weeks ago, I mean, the appetite for our product is, I can tell you, huge. And there's a lot of people interested and I think that there's no indication that we've seen that financing is a problem.
Operator: And we'll go next to Josh Patinkin from -- with BMO Capital.
Joshua Patinkin: So it looks like exposure to Large Markets increased with Colonial's portfolio, and with job growth to new supply stronger in small markets, I'm curious, 2-part question, what are the dynamics that contribute to that? And second, why not pursue more development in smaller markets right now?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, the dynamics contributing to -- I mean, Colonial had about sort of a 70-30 split in terms of how we define Large versus Secondary and we were at about 60-40 and -- on a blended basis, we're about 65-35. I mean, we -- honestly, that's kind of right where we wanted to be. Obviously, we didn't do this transaction with the idea that we're trying to maximize performance in 2014 or '15. I mean, it's a much longer horizon we're taking to this thing, and so we think that as we get into an up part of the cycle, what we've historically always found, as we've certainly seen over the last 2 to 3 years, is the large market component of the portfolio tends to outperform. And obviously, if you go back to 2008, 2009 timeframe, early 2010, our Secondary Market segment was actually outperforming. And so back to the point I was making earlier about -- our effort is to really try to achieve a optimum sort of full-cycle performance profile to the portfolio. And I mean, what drives the fundamentals in both Large and Secondary Markets is the same thing, it's just, obviously, it's job growth and demand and supply. And so these large markets are -- is where most of the supply is happening right now, and that's why you're going to see more moderation take place in Large Markets versus the Secondary, which tend to be a lot more stable. Having said that, I mean, it doesn't take a whole lot of supply, obviously, to create an imbalance in some of these Secondary Markets. And so rather than ramp up development in these Secondary Markets, we just continue to sit back and wait and let the projects that do take place there, offer an opportunity for us. Having said that, I mean, what little bit of development we have done in the past in terms of -- in sort of MAA's history, it has been in the Secondary Market. We did Charleston, we've done Little Rock, we just finished one in Nashville. So you're unlikely to see us going far. What little bit of development that we do, you're not going to see us do it in Dallas, in Atlanta, in places like that. I mean, there's plenty of that going on there. So, our point is, we do focus on the secondary whenever we do -- and we're at the part of the cycle where, development, in my mind does make sense.
Joshua Patinkin: I see. So just a handful of projects in the Secondary Markets can absorb a lot of the new job growth coming online?
H. Eric Bolton: Yes, exactly.
Joshua Patinkin: Okay. And so some of the opportunistic acquisitions you talked about, would that -- you foresee taking place more in the Secondary Markets to tilt the portfolio balance back?
H. Eric Bolton: No. I mean, we like where the balance is. So, we're not any effort to sort of shift anything around from large to secondary. But we're looking for opportunity in both large and secondary. I think that, frankly, where you're likely to see some of the better buying opportunities over the next couple of years is in some of the larger markets, simply because that's where a lot of the supply is coming online. And I think some of these markets that tend to get perhaps a little bit overbuilt from time to time. There may be some very good opportunities emerge in markets like Raleigh, in Austin. Some of the markets that are arguably weakening a little bit more and undoubtedly when some of these projects were started back and penciled out a year or 2 years ago, my guess is some of them are not going to lease-up quite as fast as some of the developers have hoped. And out of that emerges opportunity.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Tom, just to go back to a question here. As you walk through the same-store revenue guidance, can you give us the components -- how much at the midpoint of 4% is occupancy versus rate growth? And then just a question -- the other question I think that's been asked several different ways, of the $0.30 to $0.45 you talked about, how much of that do you expect to realize in 2014, versus how much of that's kind of more '15, '16?
Thomas L. Grimes: And I'll let Al walk us through the split on forecast. And then I'll follow up with the development synergies. And I'll just go ahead with those. I mean we've got, in '14, we will see $1.3 million worth of property and casualty savings. Redevelopment will generate about $1 million. On the RNM [ph] side, we see opportunity. They were -- tended to be more structure and managed to a specific benchmark. We tend to give ranges on things like efficiency and they may be at the benchmark, but what may be better for that property is, well, better than benchmark, and along those lines, they did not do any in-house carpet cleanings. We expect to do half of those in-house. That will save us about $900,000. We also get about $400,000 on scale for RNM [ph] expenses. We feel like revenue management opportunity is about $500,000. I mean -- and that just gives you a general taste of where the opportunities lie.
Albert M. Campbell: I'll give you the split on that Mike, in terms of revenue. If you look at the normal performance for the portfolio outside the synergies we talked about from Colonial, we would see pricing performance be in the 3.5% range, with occupancy increasing kind of an average 30 basis points. So the normal portfolio activity, call it 3.8% total revenue growth for the year. On top of that, you have the synergy that we talked about from the Colonial portfolio that give you the full performance. So I hope that gives you what you need.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: No, that's helpful. Second question, just in terms of development. Eric, it sounded like you're looking at a couple. Should we expect additional commencements in 2014? Or has that all been tabled at this point to really focus on acquisition?
H. Eric Bolton: No, I mean, we're looking at a couple of things, Mike. We haven't really talked to the board about it, but in both cases, frankly, what we're looking at are Phase 2 opportunities where we already own the land. We've got an opportunity up in Virginia, we've got opportunity in Orlando that we're taking a hard look at right now. And so, it will be limited. But in both cases, if we do anything this year, it probably -- something along those lines.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Third question. You bought out 2 joint venture properties in the first quarter, you have 2 more, I think, remaining with your JV partner in one of the funds. Is there a plan to kind of bring that in -- those in-house as well?
H. Eric Bolton: We're going to bring in-house one of those, and we're going to take to market to sell the other one. But we expect that fund to wind down this year.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Then finally, of the $125 million to $175 million of commercial and land sales, can you break that out between what you expect to be commercial and what you expect to kind of be land. The reason I'm asking is, obviously, the land isn't contributing any earnings, the commercial is. So as we look to '14 -- I mean, as we look to '15 and '16, kind of trying to get the earnings impact there.
Albert M. Campbell: That explains some of the 2014 noise we talked about, Mike. The vast majority of that in 2014 is going to be the commercial properties. We're working hard to sell and it's the right thing to do, to go ahead and simplify the business. But the Brookwood asset, the [indiscernible] asset and the Kraft's [ph] farm asset, we're looking to sell those during the year and that makes up the majority, based on our value of the...
H. Eric Bolton: Of the $310 million, I mean, roughly, less than or right at about 10% of it is land value. And so the vast majority of this is earning assets if you will.
Albert M. Campbell: So you'll see that land value be more impactful in 2015, as we move to sell that. And it's dead wood now. It will begin to add earnings then.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So with Brookwood and a couple of the ones, I think you mentioned [indiscernible], some of those have development land and entitlements. You will sell the whole thing? These will all come off the book?
H. Eric Bolton: Yes. Yes.
Operator: And we'll go next to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Just out of curiosity, when you kind of take look at your markets, any markets out there where you're starting to get a little bit concerned about new supply?
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, Tayo, it's Tom. I think the 2 that we're watching or the 2 that we were watching last quarter is Austin and Raleigh. Both have relatively large chunks of supply coming on. Raleigh it was sort of, if you just looked at the numbers, you would think it was past it because a bunch of it came online in 2013. But most of that supply was back ended. So we're just beginning to feel that. That said, both have awfully resilient jobs machines in them, and I can see their tail off being short-lived. But we're concerned about those 2.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. And then, Al, I just wanted to confirm my understanding of some of the synergies. Because I know we've been back and forth on this, the $25 million that's kind of been put out there on an annualized basis, you're expecting about $6 million of that to show up in 2014?
Albert M. Campbell: No, no, no. That's, that's -- let me clarify this, Tayo, that's a very good point. The $25 million is the overhead or G&A synergies that were stated in the -- when we talked about the merger. We'll capture virtually all of that in 2014. [indiscernible] Or the vast majority with the -- a certain amount trickling into '15, but most of it in '14.
Thomas L. Grimes: We'll be continuing -- I mean, our run rate by the end of this year will be reflective of that.
Albert M. Campbell: The full amount, that's exactly right. The other is, we have been talking about -- now, if you put the 2 companies together, and you take the FFO that they both had premerger, add them together, and take into account the benefit of that $25 million, you add them together, and take out 25, divide by the combined shares, you're still about $0.20 to $0.25 per share dilutive. What we've talked about is that we have opportunities, whether it be the non-core land, the development pipeline leasing-up, the redevelopment program, that gives us opportunities for an additional $0.30 to $0.45 per share on top of that stated synergy, okay? We're going to capture, call it $6 million of that in 2014. It's a lot of work to get that done, we're capturing in 2015 it'll be a lot more meaningful and some in '16. But that's what we're talking about.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Robert W. Baird.
Thomas J. Lesnick - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I'm standing in for Paula this morning. Following up on Ryan Bennett's questions on occupancy rate and revenue management, Vegas saw year-over-year declines in both occupancy and rate but has little new supply. How are you guys thinking about those assets? Do you think you got them at the trough? And what are your expectations for growth in Vegas relative to your other markets in 2014?
Thomas L. Grimes: Well, it's 2 properties in Vegas, both on the north side of it. And frankly, the market's doing pretty well, and we've got one property firing on all cylinders, and one property, honestly, that we've got a few things that have been adjusted and we're optimistic about how it will do. So just operationally, in Vegas, we feel pretty good about it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Recognizing your stated plans for the Fund II assets, Eric, can you just share your general thoughts going forward on potential JV activity?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, at this point, Dave, we don't have any plans for any additional JV programs. We really feel like that having JVs involved with us from time to time is usually -- we were trying to address a specific need or offload some risk, various things of that nature that sort of compel us to look to JV. I don't think about it so much as an effort to really establish a new funding source. And so, we think that with the assets that we've got and sort of where we have the balance sheet, candidly, just don't see a particular need for any sort of JV structure to come into play based on everything that we know today. Having said that, obviously, if an opportunity were to emerge of some sort, that we felt worth pursuing, and a JV could be useful in terms of diversifying risk or structuring the financing in some way that would create some value for our shareholders, we would certainly look to put a JV in place. But we've done several of them over the years with a lot of very sophisticated partners. But at this point, we have no need to, or plans to do any additional JV work.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: And just a disclosure item for you, Al. Can you provide the sequential same-store figures for revenue expense and NOI growth for the combined portfolio? I don't think I saw that in the supplement.
Albert M. Campbell: I can give that to you, Dave, and sequentially, it was -- the revenues were down 0.4%, which is sort of seasonal. The expenses were down 7%, which was 2 things: In the fourth quarter, you do expect some seasonal sequential decline from operating expenses going down, but we also had the impact of -- Colonial had a third quarter -- they had a lot of noise related to merger adjustments and things like that, that they were making to prepare for the transaction. So that was part of that. So the NOI was 4.4% growth. 4% down on revenues and -- 0.4% down on revenues, 7% down on operating expenses.
Operator: And we'll go next to Buck Horne with Raymond James.
Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Forgive me if I missed it, did you guys give how pricing is looking in January, both either new leasing and renewal pricing so far?
Thomas L. Grimes: We did not. On a year-over-year, the leases signed in January were up 4% for the combined portfolio and renewals were up 6.5%. Again, renewals achieved.
Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Is that an acceleration from what you saw in the fourth quarter?
Thomas L. Grimes: Renewals were up a little bit. But no, the fourth quarter on year-over-year leases were -- was also right at 4.1%.
Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Good. And, I guess for Eric, I'm just wondering, what are the real constraints to supply entering some of the secondary markets? Is it really just the lenders aren't willing to lend in those markets right now? Or what's the constraint and when do -- when does development start -- get started in the secondary markets?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, I think what we need to see is more robust recovery in the economy and more job growth. I think that if we got to a point where the job growth began to accelerate and bled more into some of the secondary markets and the demand picked up, my guess is that the numbers start to work in a more compelling way to ramp up development in some of the secondary markets. I think that, right now, I don't know whether it's necessarily a lack of access to financing capital, but I think, at least, reasonably disciplined equity capital is going to be a little bit cautious about ramping up supply in the secondary markets until we see more job growth.
Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And are construction costs rising? Are you seeing, outside is inflation in competition for labor right now in some of these markets?
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, that's -- I mean, that's obviously a good point too. And you're right, yes, it is. I mean, of course, we're not out actively trying to price out jobs and -- but based on everything that we see and folks that we talk to and developers that we talk to, certainly, rising construction costs are there. And I think that is acting as a bit of holding down some of the supply pressure as well.
Operator: And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.
H. Eric Bolton: We appreciate everyone joining us. And we will see you, I'm sure, over the next couple of months. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating in the MAA Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. The company will first share its prepared comments, followed by a question-and-answer session. At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Corporate Secretary. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin.
Leslie Bratten Cantrell Wolfgang: Thank you, Stephanie. And good morning, everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Corporate Secretary for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call, will be available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
H. Eric Bolton: Thanks, Leslie, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start my comments this morning by expressing my appreciation for all the hard work over the summer months by our folks at MAA and Colonial. We obviously had a busy summer, as our most active leasing season was also highlighted by quite a bit of work surrounding the integration of our company's operating and reporting systems, ensuring we were ready to execute as the combined company upon closing our merger. Advisers for both companies did a terrific job, and the merger transaction was successfully closed on October 1. Our property associates and the entire management team from both companies really pulled together, and we are now successfully up and running as a combined operation. As noted in our earnings release, both MAA and Colonial portfolios ended the quarter with strong occupancy, and as a result, we are well positioned for the fall and winter leasing season. I'd also like to thank Tom Lowder and the entire Colonial management team for their hard work and enthusiastic support in positioning our now combined company for a strong start. As reported in yesterday's earnings release, MAA's core FFO per share for the third quarter was $1.25 and at the top end of our guidance range. MAA's same-store NOI performance of 4.6% was in line with our expectation, and the outperformance in FFO was due to a combination of better-than-expected lease-up in our development pipeline and lower-than-expected interest cost. The midpoint of our forecast range for 2013 growth in same-store NOI of 5% has remained consistent all year. As expected, during the quarter, leasing conditions continued to support more robust performance from our large market segment of the portfolio. Houston, Dallas, Austin, Atlanta and Nashville all delivered solid revenue results. Sluggish employment conditions in Memphis and Little Rock held back rent growth and impacted our Secondary Markets segment of the portfolio in the third quarter. We continue to believe that as we head into next year, as new supply deliveries are likely to generate some moderation in pricing power, our Secondary Markets segment of the portfolio will provide a stabilizing influence on the overall portfolio performance. Next year's outlook for the ratio of new jobs to new unit deliveries is in the 8:1 range for our large market segment of the portfolio, which is consistent with this year. While the secondary market segment is forecasted to move from jobs to new units, ratio of 6:1 this year to well over 10:1 in 2014. We were encouraged with the continued low resident turnover in Q3, as we turned only 1% more units in the third quarter this year as compared to Q3 of last year. On a rolling 12-month basis, turnover remains low at 57.6%. Move-outs to buy a house remained right around 20% of our overall move-outs, consistent with what we've seen from the last several quarters. Likewise, move-outs to rent a single-family home continued to hover in the 6% to 7% range of total move-outs. These numbers have been consistent for several quarters now. While it wasn't officially part of our operation in the third quarter, I wanted to also provide a little color on the Colonial same-store portfolio in Q3. The portfolio captured year-over-year revenue growth of 4.7% in the third quarter, with the best performances coming out of Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Charlotte and Charleston, as each of these markets exceeded the average rent growth performance of the portfolio. Same-store occupancy made a strong recovery from the end of Q2 and ended the quarter at 96.4%, a 150 basis point increase. As expected, during Q3 there was some cleanup in final accruals and merger-related closing activities in the expense area, as same-store operating expenses came in high at 10.3%, a combination of onetime incentives and leasing commissions put in place shortly after the merger announcement and real estate taxes pressured expense performance in the quarter. We expect all expense line items to normalize in Q4, with the only continued pressure coming from real estate taxes. We remain comfortable with the original assessment surrounding the expense synergies and opportunities to be harvested over the next few quarters from our merger with Colonial. We're well underway towards completing systems integration activities and reworking a number of contracts and processes that we expect will benefit both profit-level NOI results and overhead cost. The 4 development projects acquired through the merger are all on track, with leasing now underway at Colonial Reserve at South End in Charlotte and Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes in Orlando. In addition, we now have the vast majority of the remaining Colonial commercial assets and nonproductive landholdings currently in the market for disposition, and we'll be working to recycle this capital into productive multi-family assets over the next year. As outlined in our supplemental schedules to the earnings release, leasing continues to go very well at our existing MAA development and lease-up properties. In particular, our lease-up in Charleston has performed well ahead of our expectation, with 170 of the 270 units delivered during the quarter and 231 or 86% of the units already pre-leased or occupied at this time. I will provide you with more details on this update of the balance sheet, but we are pleased to complete our inaugural bond offering in October. The transaction was well received and we believe our now combined balance sheet is in terrific shape. As we continue to drive higher levels of earnings productivity out of the capital on the former Colonial balance sheet, we look to build on this balance sheet strength. In summary, it was a busy quarter. We're excited to have the merger officially closed and are optimistic about the opportunities surrounding the combination of MAA and Colonial. As the current real estate market cycle continues to play out, we believe our enhanced portfolio and full cycle portfolio strategy, supported by strong operating platform, puts the company in a terrific position to continue to drive higher margins and more value from our existing asset base. Additionally, we believe that over the next couple of years, there are going to be some good opportunities to opportunistically deploy capital. Our planned capital recycling activity and solid balance sheet position puts MAA in a terrific position to support this effort. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. And now, I'll turn it over to Al.
Albert M. Campbell: Thank you, Eric. And good morning, everyone. I'll provide additional color on the company's third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and on updated guidance for the fourth quarter. As mentioned in the release, given the October 1 close of the Colonial merger, third quarter results reflect only MAA activity with combined reporting beginning in the fourth quarter. There will, of course, be a good bit of noise from the merger in the fourth quarter, but we're going to work very hard to provide as much detail and clarity as we can to help project the combined company performance for the remainder of the year. We will discuss this a bit further in a moment as we address revised guidance. Core FFO for the quarter was $55.4 million or $1.25 per share, which represents 9.6% growth over comparable results for the prior year, and was $0.04 per share above the midpoint of previous guidance. The favorable FFO performance for the quarter was primarily produced by leasing activities running well ahead of plan for the lease-up and development pipeline adding about $0.02 per share and some lower interest expense for the quarter due to the timing of the planned bond transaction, adding an additional $0.02 per share. As Eric mentioned, performance from the same-store portfolio was in line with expectations, as same-store NOI grew 4.6% for the quarter, based on 4% growth in revenues and 3.3% growth in operating expenses. Continued rent growth and strong occupancy levels drove revenue performance, with real estate taxes being the primary area of the expense pressure for the quarter, as we continue to see increases in key states such as Texas and Florida. The real estate tax expense for the third quarter grew 13.5% over the prior year, based on the 7.5% to 8% growth rate projected for the full year this year, combined with the impact of a tough comparison of last year's 2.5% growth in the third quarter. Year-to-date same-store NOI increased 5.9% based on 4.4% revenue growth and 2.3% growth in operating expenses. We closed no acquisitions during the third quarter but following quarter end, we acquired one additional new community located in Fredericksburg, Virginia, a 251-unit Haven at Celebrate, which will be operated as Phase 2 of Seasons at Celebrate, one of our existing communities purchased in 2011. Following this transaction and the gross purchase price of acquisitions year-to-date is $148.8 million including the 2 communities purchased from MAA's joint venture fund. We also sold 4 communities during the third quarter for total growth proceeds of $46.9 million and one additional community following quarter end for $10.4 million in proceeds. These transactions bring year-to-date sales proceeds at just over $131 million from 9 communities averaging 26 years of age and representing a weighted average cap rate of 7.2% based on in-place NOI after deducting a 4% management fee and $350 per unit in CapEx reserves. With these combined sales for the year, MAA exited 5 Secondary Markets segment, including Melbourne, Florida and Athens, Thomasville, Lagrange and Valdosta, Georgia. Progress on the company's lease-up and development pipeline continued during the third quarter, with one community, Cool Springs in Nashville, fully stabilizing. And with the 3 remaining completed communities all achieving over 90% occupancy during the quarter and projected to be fully stabilized in the fourth quarter, which we defined as greater than 90% occupancy for 90 days. We now have 2 MAA communities remaining under construction, with an expected total cost of $74 million for 564 units. We funded an additional $5.3 million in construction cost for these communities during the third quarter. With the Colonial merger, we also acquired 4 additional communities under construction. The total construction pipeline now consist of 1,731 units and 6 communities, with a total expected development cost of $236.5 million, of which $93 million remains to be funded. We do expect to find an additional $28 million on multi-family construction during the fourth quarter. We completed a renewal of the company's unsecured revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter. We improved the terms and increased the borrowing capacity to $500 million, with the option to expand it to $800 million, and extended the maturity by almost 2 years to late 2017. This expansion was an integral part of our plans to complete the Colonial merger and to support the larger company scale in the future. Also, following the end of the quarter and the closing of the Colonial merger, we completed our planned inaugural unsecured bond offering. We are very pleased with the market perception. We are able to execute a very successful financing, despite a volatile market backdrop. We issued $350 million of public bonds with a 4.3% coupon price at 99.047% of principal, and we settled at $150 million in forward interest rate swaps we had earlier this year, as part of the planned financing. Effective interest cost of the financing is 4.15% over the next 10 years, and the proceeds were used to pay off all of the borrowings on a revolving credit facility. Our balance sheet ended the quarter in great position. The company leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 40.8%. Total leverage was 6x recurring EBITDA, and MAA's fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as recurring EBITDA to interest expense was 4.7x. With the closing of the merger and completion of the bond deal on October, MAA's balance sheet further strengthened. Our leverage levels remained essentially the same, but unsecured debt, unencumbered assets and fixed rate protection all increased. And at the end of October, over 60% of MAA's assets were unencumbered. Secured debt was less than 25% of gross assets, and 98% of outstanding debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates, with an average maturity of 4.8 years. Finally, we're providing updated guidance for the fourth quarter reflecting combined company results. And the full year performance for the company will be comprised of 9 months of MAA stand-alone activity and 3 months of combined activity for the fourth quarter. There will be a good bit of noise in reported earnings for the fourth quarter, so we're giving guidance on a core FFO basis, which excludes merger-related and certain other items with the goal of providing more clarity and comparability to prior periods. Also, we've added a fair amount of detail on our supplemental data schedules with the press release to help model a combined company performance. Core FFO for the fourth quarter is projected to be $1.09 to $1.19 per share, which is $1.14 at the midpoint. Based on average shares of about $79.3 million following the merger. This is $0.06 per share below previous stand-alone guidance, which is in line with our expectations for the combined company, given the nonproductive development pipeline and the land bank acquired from Colonial, as well as the remaining synergies to be captured at the next 15 to 18 months. Full year core FFO is projected to be $4.81 to $4.91 per share, which is $4.86 at the midpoint. We're maintaining the midpoint of full year NOI guidance for the legacy MAA same store portfolio at 5% based on revenue growth of 4% to 4.5% and expense growth of 3% to 3.5%. We expect the legacy Colonial portfolio to produce revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 3 1/4% to 3 3/4%, which would equate to a full year revenue growth of 4 1/4% to 4 3/4%, which is within previous guidance ranges provided. NOI is projected to grow 2.5% to 3% for the fourth quarter, mainly due to operating expense growth of 4.75% to 5.25%, primarily related to pressure from real estate taxes. We now expect acquisition volume to be $175 million to $225 million for the year, and disposition volume to be $131 million, which is the current year-to-date total, as the remaining disposition plan for the year is now expected to close in early 2014. We expect G&A and Property Management expenses combined for the fourth quarter to be $14.5 million to $15.5 million, excluding merger and transition cost, which reflects about half of the expected synergy capture on a run-rate basis for the year. Total combined transaction cost related to the merger are still expected to be about $60 million in total, with around half projected to be incurred during the fourth quarter. Also, we expect to record a mark-to-market adjustment related to the assumption of the Colonial debt balances of around $90 million, which will be amortized over the remaining life of Colonial's outstanding debt, or about 4 years, and will be excluded from the calculation of core FFO. AFFO for the full year, defined as core FFO less recurring capital expenditures, is projected to be $4.20 to $4.30 per share, and our current annual dividend rate is $2.78 per share. That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Stephanie, we'll turn it over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Thank you for the color in terms of the Colonial portfolio as of the third quarter. I was just curious if you could provide some more color in terms of your top 4 pro forma markets and how Colonial's assets performed relative to MAA's legacy assets in the third quarter.
Thomas L. Grimes: Sure, Ryan. It's Tom Grimes. They're probably tough markets for Austin, Charleston, Atlanta and Dallas. And they did well in those markets, Austin was 7 2, Charleston 7 1, Atlanta 6 8 and Dallas about 6 3.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Got it. And that was on a revenue or NOI?
Thomas L. Grimes: That's on a revenue basis.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Got it. And then I guess in terms of the guidance for Colonial going to the fourth quarter it does seem to be substantial deceleration on the revenue front. Is there any particular markets that might be driving that into the fourth quarter here, given that occupancy is relatively high?
Albert M. Campbell: Well, first, let me just address that the deceleration that Tom gives some color on the markets, but if you look at the full year as a whole, I think both Colonial and -- and we have projected continued growing revenues with some slight moderation in the fourth quarter. So, I mean, I think if you look at the guidance, the midpoint of the fourth quarter revenue is 3.5%, which is slight moderation, but pretty strong still. And so, I'll let Tom give color on where that's going to come from.
Thomas L. Grimes: Just on an overall basis, the portfolio is 95 5, with just 8% exposure, which is vacancy plus unnoticed, and traffic is strong. So we sort of feel like the portfolio as a whole, both Colonial and MAA, well positioned for the fourth quarter and pricing for 2014.
Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Okay. Got it. And then just in terms of your asset sales that you've completed since the end of the second quarter. Can you give us pricing on those assets in particular, instead of just the pool to date and how that pricing came in relative to your expectations?
Albert M. Campbell: Yes, this is Al. We sold the 4 assets. And I think they came in all pretty close to expectations. And we've been working those for quite a while. We sold Marsh Oaks in Jacksonville for $7.1 million, Three Oaks in Valdosta for -- right at $12 million. Wildwood in Thomasville, Georgia, for just short of $13 million and Shenandoah Ridge in Augusta, Georgia, for $15 million.
H. Eric Bolton: I'd put the cap rate on those somewhere around 7.5 or on a blended basis for all 4 of those.
Albert M. Campbell: That's right, for average 30-year-old assets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Al, can you just help a little greater detail, sort of reconcile those sort of $1.25 core FFO in the third quarter down to the $1.14 midpoint of the fourth quarter. I assume that there's some seasonality. There's probably some dilution from the merger. And then what else sort of feeds in to the decline on a sequential basis?
Albert M. Campbell: Yes. Great question, Rob. First of all, let me say that the majority of outperformance in the third quarter was sort of onetime items. It was the quick lease up on development that got there faster than expected, but the overall run rate is what we expected. So that's sort of a onetime kick. And then the interest expense was sort of onetime kick of its timing of the bond that we ultimately did it, we just did it a little later than we thought we would, so had some savings in the third quarter.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: How much was that combined you think?
Albert M. Campbell: $0.04, those -- $0.02 a piece so that's about it. So that was really -- we had $1.21 was our guidance, our midpoint for the third quarter. So that really provided that addition. So if you look at what we gave as guidance originally for the fourth quarter, it was $1.20 per share, Rob. And so now we're at $1.14, I'll tell you that virtually all of that is the Colonial merger. And really, what that is, as expected, you've got continued synergies that we're going to capture. We did state $25 million. We feel confident in that. We captured, I think in the fourth quarter we expect to capture about half of that on a run-rate basis as we'll start to see workforce reduction, systems changes things like that, but we'll still have [indiscernible] to capture over the year. Obviously, we acquired the development pipeline, which we paid over $100 million for and is not yet productive. We expect to make that productive and as we sell non-core assets or land bank over the next couple of years, that will be productive. So the point I'm making is $0.06 dilution in the fourth quarter is the widest range that you'll see, and we would expect to see that narrow each quarter as we continue to work through those plans.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Does the Colonial portfolio go into the same-store immediately?
Albert M. Campbell: No, we'll probably -- we'd obviously be reporting combined results. But technically, we'll not go into same store because we defined our same-store for our SEC reporting. So what you'll see us do is call it consolidated results and have some language actually work through that, but we will, on a technical basis, have to keep it out of same-store, but we'll give you the information to help you see it combined and separate life cycle.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: So the same-store going forward, until what, a year from now until the fourth quarter?
Albert M. Campbell: Yes.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Will wind up being the MAA legacy portfolio?
Albert M. Campbell: Yes, that's right. But for modeling purposes, we're going to give you plenty, Rob, to help you [indiscernible] if you wanted.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: And then can you talk about how the revenue expense and NOI guidance you guys are given for the Colonial same-store portfolio differs from the legacy MAA portfolio in the fourth quarter? Are those ranges fairly consistent with the MAA? Or are you doing better in the MAA's on expenses and revenue? Can you sort of provide some color there?
Albert M. Campbell: I would say it's pretty close and the 2 -- the main stories are: One, slight moderation of revenue that we had predicted the same for the full year. And the real story is though expenses. It's taxes where we both had a strong, tough tax number in the back half of the year as we had growing expenses that continued to grow as we move through the year and got sort of bad news on taxes and we both had sort of favorable comparisons, favorable situations last year that would create a tough comparison this year. So stories from both are both very similar. Revenue is about as expected. Slight moderation fourth quarter but very bad tax expansion for the quarter.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: And then, are you guys planning on starting in the development spend guidance, is there any new starts there in the near-term?
H. Eric Bolton: Rob, this is Eric. Nothing near term that we're planning to do at this point. We're focused on getting productive the pipeline that we've got right now. There's one development site that Colonial has down in Orlando that we're taking a hard look at and thinking about if we want to do anything on that next year. But frankly, the other development sites, we're all looking to sell them at this point.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then what's -- on the current pipeline, what's the expected stabilized yield on a combined company development pipeline?
Albert M. Campbell: It's pretty similar. We've always stated, we said 7% to 8% range, Rob, we feel comfortable of that on the combined pipeline.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: This is Gaurav Mehta with David as well. A couple of questions on your guidance. So you talked seeing real estate expense pressure, but at the same time, your -- the insurance expense guidance have been lowered a couple of times this year. Can you talk about what's offsetting real estate taxes?
Albert M. Campbell: Yes. I mean the other items and everything, personnel, the big items in our, obviously, the strongest contributor are personnel, repair, maintenance, utilities and all those. And we expect those to be modest growth and not significant pressure. It's all a pressure from taxes.
H. Eric Bolton: We've also done some -- moving more and more of our leasing online and do a lot more sourcing of traffic online so our marketing costs are coming down. And frankly, as Al said, to really offset some of the pressure on real estate taxes, it's been really across the board from personnel all the way down to landscaping, trend and utilities have been positive as well.
Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Great. Second question I have is on the synergies. So you talked about $25 million in expected overhead savings. And then you also said that you expect additional savings from efficiency. Are you going to quantify that at all how much you're expecting?
Albert M. Campbell: The second portion -- Gaurav, help me on the second portion of that question, savings from what on the second portion? I didn't get that.
Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: So you also talked about that you expect additional savings in addition to $25 million. Are you able to talk about that? Are you able to quantify how much you're expecting?
Albert M. Campbell: I'll tell you, we'll have a lot more to say about that when we put out our '14 guidance. Honestly it's in the NOI area, we're in the process of renegotiating a lot of contracts from property and cash to insurance to buying paint to buying appliances. And so all that work is underway at the moment. And as we cobble together our '14 guidance and finalize our budgets, we'll have a lot more to say about the opportunities beyond the $25 million that we've talked about.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Just going back to the acquisition. Now that the deal is now complete, could you talk a little bit about versus when you initially underwrote the deal and when you've closed, if there were any material changes and ran expectations or anything of that sort?
H. Eric Bolton: No. I'll tell you, Tayo, not really. We knew the company pretty well. And probably the only thing that was different than when we started the conversations earlier in the year was the fact that they continued to sell off some of their commercial assets, and -- sold One Ravinia, which is roughly a $90 million office project in Atlanta and we continued to -- they've been very focused on continuing to get focused solely on the multifamily assets. And so we -- they sold a few more commercial assets than when we started conversations. But as far as the multifamily assets and balance sheet in general, there really was no surprises in terms of what we found or the underwriting that we assumed and how we ultimately closed the transaction.
Albert M. Campbell: I'll just add to that. On the assets, they did sell, Tannehill in Birmingham, which was addition to what you guys have seen from the third -- from the second quarter report. So I'll just continue the progress that Eric has mentioned. So the revenues combined company are well less than 2% from commercial now.
H. Eric Bolton: And I'll add. I mean we're continuing that effort. Virtually every commercial asset that they owned is in the market right now for disposition.
Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay, and that's helpful. And then in some of the Southeast markets where in a combined basis, you guys really are particularly large. Any thoughts on maybe the exposure in those markets, a little bit too heavy and probably rationalizing from a bad exposure?
H. Eric Bolton: We're going to be looking at that as part of our '14 plans. I mean we're pretty big in Dallas at this point, a little over 10% of the portfolio. Charlotte is a big market for us. And my guess is that you -- there will be some recycling going on next year as we continue to move out of lower margin investments into higher-margin investments. But yes, we're certainly sensitive to the weightings that we have in various markets now. And we generally like to not be much more than 10% in any given market. And so if there was a market to be heavy in, Dallas and Austin are not balance to be heavy in, but we'll look to probably cycle a little bit there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So just want to understand by what you mean half of the synergies of the $25 million getting reflected in the fourth quarter. Do you mean -- you don't mean $12.5 million? Do you mean the run rate of $25 million? Half of that, right?
Albert M. Campbell: $3 million to $3.5 million, Rich, exactly right. That's a run rate basis that will be half.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I figured that. I just wanted to make sure. And from the standpoint of other savings to an earlier question about renegotiating contracts and that type of stuff. Are you expecting any of that to hit in the fourth quarter?
Albert M. Campbell: There will be a little bit of it as we started. I'll give you one example, as our property-casualty insurance, we expect significant savings next year as we redo the whole portfolio. By the end of the third quarter we did bring them on to the same platform, and we'll get somewhere $0.005 to $0.01 from that. So there's beginning to already be some impact from that. I think it will be much larger next year as we [indiscernible].
H. Eric Bolton: And Rich, I'll tell you, there's really 2 areas that we're working to sort of finalize and monetize our forecast. One is just the NOI area that Al is referring to, which includes property and cash and all the other things I was mentioning earlier. The second area of opportunity is in the area of sort of redevelopment opportunity within the portfolio. As you know, we've had a fairly active sort of interior redevelopment initiative within our operation and Colonial has not. And as we've now visited almost every property, we see some meaningful opportunity there. And so we'll be moving that program into the Colonial portfolio, and we think that that's going to be some real opportunity over the next several years frankly. But exactly, the impact for next year will have, as I say, a lot more to say about that here when we release Q4 earnings.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: If we were just to take a shot at modeling this, so let's just say $25 million of overhead synergies, a G&A-type number and then another, I'm just using a number, $25 million of other savings. If you have $50 million of total savings, how much of that $50 million would be a sort of a same-store impact, and how much would be outside of that?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, let me say it this way, Rich. I mean I wouldn't -- we're totally not in a position to say we're going to have a $25 million additional on top of that. But let me just say this, if you take the additional NOI you're just talking about, the potential redevelopment opportunities and also the additional income we're going to expect to pick up from leasing up the development pipeline that's not earning right now and from the recycling assets over the next several years, there's -- we think $0.30 to $0.45 per share opportunity in all of those things combined. We haven't yet -- we're not yet ready to break out the components and talk specifics. We'll give you a lot more color in Q4 as we release our...
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: $0.35 to $0.40 of total savings including the $25 million?
H. Eric Bolton: Yes, we're not -- that's leasing up the development pipeline, monetizing the assets and all, and the NOI additions and the real -- that program, all of that together but, yes.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Got you. So it's some revenue, some cost savings. In terms of supply, Eric, you mentioned the supply potentially being a headwind for you in your primary markets next year. I mean, wouldn't that also be a significant problem for where the CLP portfolio is situated, that supply would be an issue, even maybe more so with them than they would from the legacy MAA portfolio?
H. Eric Bolton: Yes. I mean, clearly, Colonial has a bigger presence in larger markets but let me give you some perspective on this. When we talk about supply pressure, of course, it's pressure only to the extent that there's not jobs there to absorb the supply. And we use these jobs to supply a ratio as sort of a barometer to make an assessment of how weak or how strong the market's going to be and how much pressure you're going to get from supply. And you look at the large markets segment of the portfolio, both on a combined basis, the ratio of job growth to supply trends -- and this is using economy.com and Reis and maybe all the same services that everybody uses. So these are not our numbers, but the ratio in the large markets segment this year is 8:1. Next year, in the large markets segment, it's 8.5:1. And so it's hard to get anxious about a real supply problem at this point, assuming -- this is an important assumption, assuming that we continue to get steady job growth. And so the idea that the large markets are headed for some sort of cliff, I think is a tremendous overstatement. I think that some moderation is to be expected, and of course, it varies a bit by market. But in aggregate, the ratios are pretty comparable next year to where we are this year. I think what's more important to also recognize is the secondary market component is different, and that's why we have this component in our portfolio because these segments of the -- the other portfolio of these markets don't get the supply pressure. These markets though are also very dependent on job growth, they don't get a lot of supply, but they need job growth to get -- to absorb what little supply they do get. If you look at the secondary markets this year, that ratio in 2013 is about 6:1. Next year, it's going to jump to over 10:1. And so, again, it's hard to -- we think the secondary markets are going to be -- do exactly what they're supposed to do as we get into '14 and '15.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: But, I mean, of those 6 or 10 jobs, how many of them are really career-oriented jobs, and how many are crossing guards?
H. Eric Bolton: So, I mean, in places like Charleston, it's Boeing. In places like Chattanooga, it's Volkswagen. In Savannah, it's Gulfstream and General Dynamics. I mean, these secondary Sun Belt markets have envious quality manufacturing jobs coming to them. I don't think we have any crossing guards, I'm not sure.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. Just 2 quick final ones. Commercial sales, what's the -- what do you -- I should know this but just the value of that -- I know it's relatively small, and what you're thinking cap rates might be from out of the commercial, Colonial's commercial portfolio?
Albert M. Campbell: I'm going to tell you, just first, Rich, as I mentioned they had progress in Tannehill for a potential $40 million in the third quarter. The other major projects, the Brookwood in Birmingham, the mall and the office, and the Norlock [ph], the project in Covington, Louisiana. Those are 2 major ones. And so I think cap rates are in that -- just over 8, somewhere in that range, I think, is what we would expect.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And dollar value?
Albert M. Campbell: Dollar value, those 3 projects together, you're probably talking $120 million range.
H. Eric Bolton: Yes. I was going to say that the total value for the operating commercial assets is $100 million to $120 million, excluding Tannehill, is where we have it.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then lastly, do you still look at $60 million of merger-related costs in the fourth quarter?
H. Eric Bolton: We do. We stated that originally. We still feel like that's the right number. Well, it's obviously composed of legal and advisory. It's composed of debt cost, debt assumption costs, and all those things, we still feel good about that number. And let me follow-up on the synergy question you had earlier, Rich, just to make sure you understood. The $0.30 to $0.45 that I mentioned was above the stated $25 million in synergies that we talked about. That's additional earnings from those areas.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. You said $0.30 to $0.45 of incremental over and above the $25 million of overhead savings.
H. Eric Bolton: Right. Perhaps over the next years as we work through that plan, yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I appreciate a lot of color surrounding the merger. I know you can't talk about a lot of the items, and are waiting to provide more detail in January. But can you help me understand on the land portion, what you're selling today in the marketplace? Who's the bidder in Sun Belt in terms of the land parcel today, how the initial conversations are going? And any round numbers you can provide about to what the pricing expectations are?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, I mean, there's the total land bank of -- we've got the value roughly around $90 million. About $30 million of it's multifamily, and about $60 million of it is office retail, various outparcels, some single-family. And we've got a vast majority of each of these parcels in the market at the moment. And pricing is -- it may follow the board. But I mean, broadly speaking, it's all coming in line with -- as you can imagine, did a lot of work in valuing this stuff before we did the merger. And so, we'll have, again, a lot more to say about it, but I think that the $90 million roughly a value that we ascribe to this portfolio, this land bank, we feel very confident that we'll be able to get that monetized.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And there's been no mark taken against it so far suggesting that there's just nothing but upside right here? There's going to be gains to be reported on these parcels, no impairments?
H. Eric Bolton: No, that number I gave you is the marked number.
Albert M. Campbell: Yes. I mean, understand the process, Haendel. This is Al. That what we will do is go by the process of recording these assets, what we believe is fair market value on October 1. So if everything worked out right, we'd sell it exactly for that. Hopefully, we can have some addition, but that's how we approach it. It should be fair market value on initial recording.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got you. Okay. And curious on the recent acquisition in Fredericksburg, was it opportunistic? Did the developer come to you? And are you seeing any more anxious sellers in some of your Sun Belt markets today?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, the developer built the adjacent phase that we acquired back in 2011. And so, we had talked to him about this for some time, starting back in 2011. So, it wasn't really marketed. We, all along, had plans to buy this from him. We just wanted to give it to a certain lead status before we took it on. But in answer to your other question, yes. I think that as we begin to see some of these projects come online increasingly in 2014 and 2015, I believe there is going to be some great buying opportunities emerge out of this. We're in conversations currently with several developers on deals that they are either just starting or they are well into construction. And with talk now of more supply coming into the marketplace, we'll find developers who are increasingly wanting to talk about going ahead and doing some sort of a pre-purchase contract, which more or less allows them to get the risk off the table. And on a non-marketed basis, we're able to come in and offer them an exit, and we feel like bringing brand-new assets on the portfolio at pretty attractive pricing.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Appreciate that. And one last one. Earlier this week, we heard, maybe it was last week, one of your peers identified Austin and Raleigh specifically as higher risk markets for next year. I would love to get your assessment on these 2 markets over the near team, given that they're now top-five markets within the pro forma portfolio.
H. Eric Bolton: We like Austin and Raleigh. We certainly wouldn't categorize them as high risk but I think they're moving from fabulous to pretty darn good. Austin, this year, had 3 jobs for every 1 unit, and it will be about the same in 4 -- but it's also got, in '14, excuse me, it's got 4% job growth coming on. We feel like we won't be able to do double-digit rent growth there anymore, but it will still be stable for us. And then, Raleigh's sort of the same. It was 2:1 this year, and it's going to bump up to 6:1. It will be a little more stable but it's held -- both of them have held good rent growth so far. So they -- I think they'll back off from white-hot to just solid good high growth markets.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And one last follow-up, if I could. Earlier, in response to a question, you mentioned rationalizing your portfolio in certain markets. The use of the proceeds -- so I presume that they will be to largely fund redevelopment, some of those redevelopment opportunities within the Colonial portfolio you talked about, or can you give us some thoughts on what the capital would be used for?
H. Eric Bolton: So it's a combination of just wherever the best opportunity is at that time. And certainly, the redevelopment opportunity's very accretive, and very accretive uses of capital, and we definitely expect that, that will be a big component of it. But as I was talking a moment ago, we are also believing and optimistic that we're going to see some great external growth, new acquisition opportunities that will be compelling as well. But we'll take a hard look at whatever the best capital deployment decision is at that time it may very well be just to continue to strengthen the balance sheet in some way, whether that is -- depending on where we're being priced in the public markets, and depending on sort of where we feel very good about where our leverage level is at this point. But we're committed to keeping the balance sheet very strong. So it's hard to -- I mean, we'll, again, have a lot more to say about planned capital deployment for 2014 as we get our forecast together but there will be -- I'm sure we'll be able to put the recycled capital work in an effective manner.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And stock repurchase will be on that menu of consideration as well?
H. Eric Bolton: If it makes sense.
Operator: And our next question comes from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Wanted to ask first about the MAA legacy portfolio. You said the performance in that portfolio was generally in line with your expectations in the third quarter. So can you just talk about what you saw coming in the fourth quarter that made you lower your same-store revenue growth midpoint by 25 basis points?
Albert M. Campbell: Yes, I mean, I think we just saw -- at the beginning of the year, we've put the guidance out, saying that we would see a modest decline of revenues in the back part of the year, we saw that. But we also saw a decline in the expenses offsetting that, Karin, so I'm going to think we would say NOI growth at the midpoint is exactly the same, and we just took the top end of the range down a bit it on the revenues and then, the same on the expenses.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And can you just give us some color on what you saw trend-wise in October from a rent standpoint?
H. Eric Bolton: Sure. For the consolidated company, the rents -- the asking rents were up about 5%. And then, does that answer your question?
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Yes, and how did they trend from, say, August, September into October?
H. Eric Bolton: We don't have combined numbers on that in terms of the both companies together but...
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just the MAA legacy is fine, if you can give us that.
H. Eric Bolton: Yes, no problem. MAA legacy on the trend basis was -- bear with me just a second, I've got it. I think broadly speaking, our rent growth has been in that 4% to 5% range, which is in line with the revenue guidance that we gave for the year. I mean, this year for the most part, our revenue result was all driven by rent growth, and so we've been seeing 4% to 5% sort of rent growth throughout the course of the year. And as Tom just mentioned, I mean, asking rents in October were up 5% year-over-year, now that's on a consolidated portfolio. I would expect the MAA component of that to still be in kind of that...
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Around the same range?
H. Eric Bolton: Right around the 5% range as well.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. Next question's just on Colonial. What quarter do you guys think that $0.06 dilution number that you have in 4Q, when do you think that will turn positive next year?
H. Eric Bolton: I'd say, Karin, it's really hard to say because it's a function of not only getting the sort of the NOI opportunity fully captured, but it's recycling capital. So it's selling properties and it's buying properties, and absolutely timing those transactions and telling when that's going to happen is hard to say. We think that the synergy component will be fully realized by the end of next year. We think that the opportunities surrounding the recycling of capital is a function of the transaction markets and it's really hard to predict that, it could be a 12 to 24-month period of time, it's just really, really hard to say. I will say this though, that the $0.06 of dilution goes down from here on a per quarter basis because we are realizing opportunity every quarter. And so, this quarter is the biggest gap we have in terms of dilution and as a result of the nonproductive assets and the development pipeline. As we continue to lease-up the pipeline, it all starts to become more productive every day. And exactly when it turns positive, it's hard to say. But, again, we'll have a lot more clarity on that as we put out our plans for '14.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Eric, I think you said when you announced the merger that you thought that Colonial would have better growth than the MAA legacy portfolio next year. Now that you've gotten to know the portfolio a little bit better from here, do you still believe that, that'll be the case?
H. Eric Bolton: I believe that the markets that Colonial brings to the portfolio tend to be higher job growth markets on a balanced basis. They are a little bit more exposed to supply because they are the large markets. But as we've said all along, I mean, our whole approach is built around the idea of trying to establish a, what we refer to as a full cycle performance profile. You may call it a balanced profile, but we think it's appropriate to weigh capital in large markets where you perhaps have a little bit more exposure to supply, but you also get the benefits of more robust job growth. And I allocate a portion of capital to secondary markets where you're not as exposed to supply but you're more dependent on job growth. And so, we're trying to weigh both sides of the equation a little bit in an effort to create this full cycle profile. Now, having said that, Colonial brings a ratio of sort of large to secondary, moves up from about 55, 45, large, 45, secondary, that is based on legacy MAA to now roughly around 60-40 large as a result of the -- 60% large and 40% secondary, as a result of this combination. And so we think that on balance, we are a little bit more exposed to higher growth markets as a consequence of the merger, and we're glad of it.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And last question for me is what are you guys thinking in terms of property taxes for next year? Do you think that you'll still be under pressure from a lot of your municipalities, or do you think that will start to ease in 2014?
Albert M. Campbell: I think -- this is Al. I think you'd see a little bit of easing -- I mean, I think the important thing is to look at taxes over the long term. In the last 6 years, it's [indiscernible] this year, let's call it 8% growth. They've grown 6 years, 2%. And so I think, definitely, over a long term, a more modest growth pattern will definitely -- we would expect that we're at the peak of the pressure. So we're not yet ready to put out guidance for next year, but we believe we'll see some moderation next year and we'll put more color on that in the next year.
H. Eric Bolton: It won't be 8%.
Albert M. Campbell: We don't expect it to be 8%. That's what -- so we'll put that out next quarter but you should see some moderation.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paula Poskon from Robert W. Baird.
Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Eric, what exactly is left to do in terms of integrating either the people, the systems, the reporting structure, et cetera?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, the people portion is done. That's -- we've completed that. But one of the big steps we've got left to do is integrate the property management systems. They were on Yardi. We're on MRI. We'll be converting to Yardi on the first half of next year. We've got some consolidation to do on the AP system, the accounting and general ledger system. So a fair amount of systems work left to be done over the next 6 to 9 months.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Eric, bigger picture question, if you look at '14 -- I mean, when you look at '14, '15 and '16, how much of the Colonial portfolio would you say is core versus kind of order assets kind of don't fit the MAA definition there? And going forward, how should we think about recycling of apartment capital over the next couple of years given the 133 that you've done -- 131 you've finished the year-to-date.
H. Eric Bolton: I would tell you that it's all core in a sense that it's markets that we want to be in. There's really no market exposure that we're being introduced to as a result of this merger that we don't feel good about. Having said that, our recycling plan is really predicated on, as it has been for MAA for a while now, rotating capital out of lower after CapEx margin investments into higher CapEx margin investments. And so I would tell you that a reasonable run rate for us is going to be around $150 million to $200 million of recycling going on every year just to ensure we're continuing to refresh the portfolio with higher margin investment. '14 will be a year that we'll be taking a look at things because as you know, we also have a fair amount of recycling that we're committed to doing in terms of commercial assets as well. And we're putting a high priority on rotating out of these commercial assets, and that there's dilution associated with that. But I would tell you that there's nothing non-core that comes from this, and really, for us, it's just going to be cycling just as a discipline, lower margin investments to higher margin investments. And now, we put that number at $150 million to $200 million.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Great. Second question. Within the Colonial portfolio specifically, relative to when the transaction was announced to where you stand today, how much turnover at the property level have you seen in terms of personnel?
Thomas L. Grimes: Mike, it's Tom. I mean, virtually none. We had, really, the advantage of being able to work with those property teams and then, we'll go forward multisite team. We started talking to them as early in June, and we had the multisite team combine from both companies by mid-July, and we were meeting and visiting properties on a regular basis by August. So, frankly, because of that great cooperation we had out of Birmingham, we were able to communicate with folks we have not had any material turnover that was merger-related on either side of the fence. We've got a great team going forward.
H. Eric Bolton: Other than what we had planned for, I mean, we made some changes at the multisite level but that was all done early on.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just given your comments then on supply starting to taper a little bit next year in your small markets, and then being pretty comfortable in your larger markets, is there any -- how do you think about development starts -- new development starts realizing those wouldn't be until like -- until '16, probably, at the earliest, in '14?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, I would tell you that we continue to believe in our model, which is not being a big developer. Having said that, we will do perhaps a little bit, sort of order of magnitude, $150 million, maybe $200 million. But again, our model is more built around the notion of outsourcing the risk and the operation where essentially we enter into pre-purchase transactions for something that is being built by a developer that we've got a lot of confidence in. I would tell you that what we would probably be targeting mostly would be some of these more high-growth, vibrant secondary markets for that sort of activity. I've often thought about -- I mean, the idea of building in Dallas or building in Atlanta, I kind of step back and say, "Why?" I mean, let others do that. Because there's plenty of it that happens and I'd rather just be an opportunistic buyer in those markets. But take a market like Charleston as an example, where we did a pre-purchase development deal like I just described here, and we just got most of the units this quarter, and the darn thing's already 86% leased. So, I mean, it's unbelievable in some of these stronger secondary markets, what you can do because there's just not that much supplied. So, that probably would be where we would target what limited development we did do, is in some of these vibrant secondary markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Then, just finally, in terms of the market, I mean, your revenue growth, you reduced a little bit. You're seeing pressure in real estate taxes. What are you seeing in terms of asset pricing right now? Have you seen any moderation in cap rates in the last 90 to 120 days, or is it holding pretty firm there?
H. Eric Bolton: It's holding firm, Mike. We saw a little bit of noise back about 3 months ago when there was some talk about -- the Fed was suggesting that they were going to start to pull back a little bit, but the market quickly sort of got past that, and I can tell you, I mean, we're still seeing in our large markets transactions based on our underwriting trading anywhere from just under 5 to 5.5 all day long, and we're seeing transactions in secondary markets in 5.25 and 5.75 range, for high quality newer assets that we're interested in buying. So we haven't really seen a lot of change.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons.
Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division: Can you share the number of units you actually purchased from Colonial? I know it has the same store count in the supplement, but what's the total number that's not in development?
Albert M. Campbell: Just over 34,000. We could dig the exact numbers. Stabilized operating units were 34,147 and leased up, 252. So total operating were 34,399, and there was 1,167 in development.
Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division: And then I just want to make sure I understand this right. Your projected amortization of debt, market to market, that will be included in FFO but excluded from core FFO. Is that right?
Albert M. Campbell: Yes, it will be excluded from core FFO. We're going to -- we plan to provide guidance on core FFO, Carol, because we think that's a clearer picture but reported FFO, we'll have it in there, in the part of the NAREIT definition, yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Bragg with Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Can you share your observations so far on Colonial's use of LRO, and how it might differ from how you use it, and whether or not there's any revenue growth upside based solely on that transition?
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes. I mean, obviously, they used the same system. We do, do it. We -- you operated differently, Dave. And yes, there is -- we feel like some upside on it. We tend to set some base parameters out there on what range LRO can operate in and then let it optimize asset by asset and really get it down to working on individual floor plans and individual units. Colonial tended to take a -- make that band a little tighter and force it up at certain times, which tended to dictate prices more centrally than letting the system optimize. I mean, they used it well. We just see some opportunity in tweaking that.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: So, Tom, how could we quantify that? Do you have a view as to where their rents are versus where you think they could be?
Thomas L. Grimes: I think we've got to spend a little more time diving into the system on that before I'd be comfortable saying it's worth a percentage point of rent growth or something like that.
H. Eric Bolton: Dave, I would tell you, I mean, if you look at sort of June 30 numbers, average rent and average revenue in our portfolio was a little bit higher than the Colonial portfolio when you consider the fact that they've got a higher concentration of larger markets, you would think it would be the opposite. So I would tell you that we think that there is definitely some opportunity there, and we just -- we're not ready to quantify just yet, but we're -- it's there.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Next question is, can you please reconcile the outlook, I think, that you shared on potential operating expense synergies, outside of, of course, G&A and property management expense, reconcile that with the what I think was 10% expense growth in 3Q and 5% expense growth in 4Q for the Colonial portfolio.
Albert M. Campbell: Dave, this is Al. I'm trying -- let me make sure I understand your question. Are you saying -- you're trying to get a better picture of the fourth quarter and where that change is coming from in terms of run rate? Let me make sure I understand what you're asking.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Sure, Al. So, earlier in the call, you seem to suggest that there are other operating expense savings opportunities beyond the $25 million of G&A and property management expense savings that you expect. Please correct me if I'm wrong on that, but I thought you said that. But then we see Colonial expense growth up more than 10% in the third quarter and up 5% in the fourth quarter, so maybe it's really a margin question, what are the margins in the Colonial portfolio today and where do you think they will come out at?
Albert M. Campbell: Well, let me first -- I think what we were discussing in the first part of that was potential NOI savings above the $25 million sort of overhead savings. I think the difference there Dave, that will come over a long period of time. I mean, that's not really fourth quarter, that's more next year even into some of the following year. And so that's a longer-term picture. And talking about the fourth quarter, I think what I was trying to communicate, and I probably didn't a good job on that, was that the main pressure is taxes for both our portfolio and their portfolio in the fourth quarter. We're having about 10% increase, same for both. Both because you've seen a 7% to 8% increase in the current year growth rate, and both had sort of a tough comparison last year because we were reducing accruals up in the last year because things came in more favorable. It sort of was -- a lot of municipalities kicked the can down the road on the growth. So that, and so the other -- and what I was trying to say was the other areas of operating expenses: personnel, repair and maintenance, utilities, all of -- landscapes, those things, they are more moderate and so, they are not really causing a pressure, 5% in total. Real estate taxes is the main point of growth.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: And just to ask it a slightly different way, I think you said that COP's expense growth in the second half of the year is roughly 7.5%. I think that, that's above their original plan. Why did that occur, and what portion of these higher expenses are going to continue going forward?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, what I would tell you, Dave, is -- what I was commenting on, or I think I've said something about in my prepared comments, some of the pressure in the third quarter, the 10.3 in the Colonial portfolio, was a result of some onetime leasing incentives and some accrual catch-ups and some other things that we booked as part of the merger close and some things that they've put in place sort of after they announced in early June that this transaction was going to occur. And as you may recall, the Colonial occupancy really fell off at the end of the second quarter. We felt it was important to get it back before we got into the winter. So there were some onetime things done in the third quarter in an effort to address those issues and those concerns. On top of that, we had the expense pressure associated with real estate taxes, as Al was mentioning. Now, as we get into the fourth quarter, we see real estate taxes still being a little bit of a pressure point, for the reasons that Al mentioned, we're comparing against the prior year number, that's very, very difficult. But those onetime sort of leasing incentives and other things that were done in Q3 will not repeat themselves in Q4. And so, we'll expect to see same-store expense in Q4 in a year-over-year basis moderate back down into that 5% range or so off of the 10% that we had in Q3. The other part of your question surrounding expense savings that comes from renegotiating contracts and all the other things that we're going to be doing that affect NOI, that's all stuff that we'll get into next year. And that's something totally different. And so, I think that -- it's just Colonial's Q3 expense result was unusual because of the company effectively was merging with us, and a lot of things were down onetime, but that's -- so I wouldn't read more into it than that.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Last question is, you're pretty sure of the sequential same-store revenue expense in NOI growth figures for the Colonial portfolio in 3Q.
H. Eric Bolton: Yes, we have it right here, hold on. The -- there it is, yes. Right here, okay. Yes, sequential revenue growth was 2.5% and the sequential expense growth was 12.3%. For just the Colonial portfolio, Q2 versus Q3, '13, 2.5% in revenue, 12.3% in expenses.
Operator: And I'm currently showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.
H. Eric Bolton: No closing comments. So, thanks, everybody for joining us this morning, and we'll see a lot of you next week. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating in the MAA Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. The company will share -- first share its prepared comments, followed by a question-and-answer session. At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin.
Leslie Bratten Cantrell Wolfgang: Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday’s press release with our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning’s call, will be available on our website. In addition, I want to point out that in this morning's call, management will be making some prepared comments related to the pending merger of MAA and Colonial Properties Trust. However, because we are currently in the SEC review process of the joint proxy statement and prospectus related to the pending merger transaction, management will not be taking questions related to the proposed merger. Q&A at the end of the call will be limited to matters related to our second quarter earnings. In connection with the proposed transaction, MAA will include a definitive joint proxy statement of the company in Colonial and a registration statement filed with the SEC that will also serve as a prospectus for MAA. Investors are urged to read the joint proxy statement and prospectus and other relevant documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available, because they will contain important information. You may obtain a free copy of the definitive joint proxy statement and prospectus filed with the SEC at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, or on our website at www.maac.com, or by contacting our Investor Relations Department at (901) 682-6600. MAA and our directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect to the proposed transaction. You can find information about the company's executive officers and directors in our Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on March 22, 2013. This shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction, in which such offer, solicitation or sale, would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
H. Eric Bolton: Thanks, Leslie, and good morning, everyone. Before getting into a discussion about our results for the quarter, I do want to provide a quick update on progress surrounding our merger with Colonial Properties. As Leslie mentioned, we are in the SEC review process of the joint proxy statement and prospectus. We expect to have the definitive proxy mailed out to shareholders as soon as that process is complete. We do continue to believe that we will be able to close the transaction sometime in September. At this point, we are all well into preparations for the integration of the 2 operating platforms. We anticipate having all the appropriate transaction, execution and reporting task up and running on a consolidated basis at closing. As outlined in our earlier announcement, we expect the full systems integration process will take place over the course of the next 18 months. Our management team is in full consolidation planning and execution mode and we remain comfortable with the earlier assumptions made surrounding synergy gains and the various benefits to be derived from this combination, which were outlined in our prior announcements and presented at the Navy conference back in June. Assuming the transaction closes as expected, when we release our third quarter results, we will be in a position to provide an updated earnings outlook for 2013 on a combined company basis. The key takeaways from this morning's call are that we continue to feel good about the projections provided at the time we announced the merger on June 3 and that integration work is fully underway and proceeding very well. Assuming we're able to close our merger sometime during September, our reported results for the quarter and for full year 2013 will obviously have a number of merger-related and one-time transactions included. The overall merger transaction will be recorded as an acquisition for accounting purposes, which, depending on the exact timing of the close, will potentially require the inclusion of MAA standalone results for a portion of the third quarter with combined results for the remainder of the quarter. MAA will record acquired assets at market value and incur a significant portion of the total expected deal cost on the closing date. We intend to provide you with clear communication of the details with our third quarter release, which will be following the expected closing date of the merger. I also want to take a moment to offer my thanks and appreciation to our hard-working associates at both MAA and Colonial. As with most merger transactions, there has been a significant amount of work going on, a lot of late nights and some tough personnel decisions in connection with putting the 2 organizations together, while also, of course, staying focused on taking care of our existing residents, properties and operations. Tom Lowder and his management team have been terrific to work with through this process, and we look forward to completing the merger and executing on a successful integration. I want to thank all of our associates at both MAA and Colonial for their hard work and service to our residents, to our shareholders and to each other. And with that brief update on the merger, I'll now turn my comments to a discussion of the quarter's results. As detailed in yesterday's earnings release, operating performance reflects continued solid leasing conditions across the portfolio, same-store physical occupancy at the end of the quarter at 96%, slightly ahead of last year. Average effective rent for the quarter increased 4.1% as compared to the prior year and grew 1.2% on a sequential quarter basis. Resident turnover remains low with our 12-month turn rate through the second quarter at 57.2%, up slightly from 56.5% at the same point last year. Move-outs associated with buying a house generate 20% of our turnover through the first half of this year, which is fairly consistent with last year at 19%. Move-outs associated with renting a house continues to not generate any meaningful pressure, driving only 6.8% of our move-outs year-to-date, which is also fairly consistent with what we've experienced over the past several quarters. Move-outs due to the amount of rent increase we're asking have moved down slightly from last year at 12% of our move-outs year-to-date, as compared to 13% last year. We continue to be encouraged by the steady growth in rents. With our revenue growth year-to-date at 4.6% and based on the full year revenue guidance of 5% to 6%, we obviously expect that current pricing trends will continue over the second half of the year. As expected at this point in the cycle, the Large Markets segment of the portfolio continues to deliver better pricing performance when compared to the Secondary Markets segment. Austin, Houston, National, delivered some of our best results in the second quarter. We continue to believe that forecasted new supply across our portfolio is unlikely to mature a [indiscernible] in leasing conditions over the next several quarters. The Texas markets continue to enjoy healthy employment conditions and should absorb the new supply coming on line without meaningful deterioration in pricing trends. The outlet for new job growth and new supply across our large tier markets in 2014 remains healthy at almost 8:1, well ahead of what is needed to generate positive absorption and drive what we believe will be continued solid rent growth, exceeding long-term averages. And as employment trends continued to improve across our secondary markets, we're excited about strengthening leasing prospects and rent growth from this segment of the portfolio as well. As we've commented in the past, our secondary markets generally tend to not be as exposed to supply pressure and we believe bring a stabilizing influence to the overall portfolio's performance as new development ramps up in this phase of the cycle. Leasing at our 4 new lease up properties continues to go well and was slightly ahead of our forecast. We've been particularly pleased with leasing pace at our Phase 2 lease up at 1225 South Church Street in Charlotte after having received the last of the 210 units in April, the property is already 98% leased and almost 80% occupied. This is very strong leasing and well ahead of our pro forma expectations. We expect to stabilize all 4 lease up projects around year end. We'll remain active with capital recycling plans, with 4 properties sold during the quarter and 2 properties acquired. From all that we've seen, cap rates haven't moved in the past few months and investor appetite for our apartment real estate in both large and secondary markets remain strong. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. And now I will turn the call over to Al. Al?
Albert M. Campbell: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide a few comments on the company's second quarter results, balance sheet activity for the quarter and on our updated view of premerger guidance. Core FFO for the quarter, which excludes the $5.7 million in merger-related costs was $56.6 million or $1.27 per share, which is $0.05 above the midpoint of previous guidance and 12% above the prior year. Year-to-date, core FFO in the same basis was $111.8 million or $2.53 per share, which was 13% above the prior year. Same-store NOI guidance of 5.5% for the quarter was in line with our expectations and has continued strong occupancy and pricing strength supported total revenue growth of 4.4% for the quarter. Same-store operating expenses increased 2.9% for the quarter, with property taxes and insurance producing the largest portion of the increase. And operating expenses for the quarter, excluding taxes and insurance, increased only 1.4%. Year-to-date, same-store NOI increased 6.6%, based on a 4.6% increase in revenues and a 1.7% increase in operating expenses. We expect continued solid revenue growth over the remainder of the year, with only slight moderation in the fourth quarter. Operating expense growth over the remainder of the year will be impacted by real estate taxes due to challenging prior year comparisons. Credits recorded in the back half of the prior year produced only about 1.5% growth in real estate taxes, resulting in tough comparisons over the next 2 quarters, as compared to the last year. Our performance and FFO results for the second quarter was mainly produced by recent development communities leasing and ahead of plan, revised timing of financing transactions and lower than projected G&A cost for the quarter. These items combined to produce about $0.04 per share of favorability for the second quarter, with an additional $0.01 per share coming from gains of settlement of casualty claims, which are included in FFO, per NAREIT's definition. During the second quarter, we acquired 2 communities, one community was acquired from Mid-America Multi-family Fund I, which was the only remaining community in the fund and that fund is now closed. The second community was purchased during lease up and was 72% occupied when acquired. The gross combined purchase price for both communities was $71.1 million, including an $18.3 million loan relating to the Fund I community, which was assumed by the company. We also sold 4 communities during the second quarter, for total gross proceeds of $74 million. The 4 communities averaged 23 years of age and were sold for a blended cap rate of 6.6%, that's based on in-place NOI after a 4% management fee and $350 per unit CapEx reserve. And also these sales represented an exit from 2 secondary markets for the company, Athens, Georgia and Melbourne, Florida. Progress on the company's developed pipeline continued during the second quarter with one community being completed and moving into the lease up growth. We now have 2 communities remaining under construction, with an expected total cost of $73.8 million for 564 units, of which $36 million remains to be funded. We funded a total of $8.6 million of development costs in the second quarter and expect an additional $25 million to be funded over the remainder of the year. We also have 4 communities remaining in lease up, 3 developed by MAA and the one recently acquired. These 4 communities were 82% occupied on a combined basis at the end of the quarter and we expect 3 of these communities to be fully stabilized by the fourth quarter, with the final community projected to be stabilized in the first quarter of next year. We completed a number of key balance sheet plans during the second quarter. During May, we entered foreign interest rate swap contracts to effectively lock the rate on $150 million of our bond financing plan for later this year. Our time improved, fortunately, as we were able to complete the trades before the recent rise in Treasury rates. And given the expected timing of the pending merger, we now expect our bond offering will occur late third quarter or early fourth quarter this year. Also, after quarter end, we've received commitments from our bank group for a new upsized, unsecured credit facility. The new facility will provide initial borrowing capacity of $500 million with expansion capacity of up to $800 million. New facility reflects current or improved market pricing and provides the company for liquidity and growth necessary to support the planned larger company. Closing of the new facility is expected over the next couple of weeks. Our balance sheet ended the quarter in growth position. The company leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 43.2%. Total debt was 6.3x EBITDA and MAA's fixed charge coverage ratio defined as EBITDA to interest expense was a solid 4.2x. At the end of the quarter, 88% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates over the next 4 years and our total average interest rate was 3.5%. We plan to increase the duration of our interest rate maturities over the long term, with a long-term bond financing plan later this year. Finally, given the second quarter performance, we're increasing our FFO guidance for the year. We're now projecting stand-alone FFO, excluding the merger related cost, to be $4.83 to $5.03 per share, which is $4.93 at the midpoint. This range represents a $0.06 per share increase over the midpoint of previous guidance. We're maintaining our same-store guidance, which continues to project solid pricing performance and stable occupancy, supporting 4% to 5% revenue growth for the full year. We expect operating expenses over the remainder of the year to increase 3% to 4% in total, with real estate taxes producing the primary expense pressure for the year as mentioned before. Given the pending merger, we now expect timing of funding transactions primarily to planned bond transaction to produce about $0.01 per share of additional favorability that is now expected to occur a bit later than previously planned. AFFO for the full year on a stand-alone basis and before merger-related cost is now expected to be $4.21 to $4.41 per share. And our current annual dividend rate is $2.78 per share. And that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Howard, I'll turn the call over to you for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Al, just a question for you sort of looking into '14, the focus in the last couple of years relative to the capital structure has been distancing the company from the GSEs and moving towards an unsecured rating. What do you think your top goals will be after the merger relative to balance sheet activities?
Albert M. Campbell: I think we'll see -- you'll see us have a balanced approach is a simple answer to that, David. And we're very proud of where we've come with our balance sheet and we've certainly achieved very good metrics that take us to the bond market this year. We feel like we'll be able to execute our inaugural offering in good position. And so you'll see us, over time, obviously continue to support that platform. But over the long term, continued commitment to our partners to have maximum access to capital will be our plan. So hopefully that answers your question, as to what you're looking for.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: If we start to see rates kind of -- spreads widen a little bit into the end of the year, do you think that would cause you to sort of take any kind of different direction relative to that approach?
Albert M. Campbell: Well, I'll say a couple of things to that. One is on the deal we're affecting -- doing this year, we've already locked in about half of it, we're fortunate with the trades that we did, as mentioned earlier. And where the market is right now, David, I would say that unsecured debt is probably -- it's inside of agency right now. We would probably -- if we did a deal a day, you're probably talking about 4.5% all-in costs. And I think if we did a similar agency deal today, you're probably talking about 4.75% for a 10-year deal, on both of those. So I think you would see us just continue to have a balanced approach, maybe taking, tactically, over time, the best solution at the time, but making sure that we keep our appropriate metrics in balance with what our plans are.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Is there a reason you don't consider [indiscernible] at this point, given your scale and kind of where yields are, would that be an attractive option in a rising rate environment?
Albert M. Campbell: I'll think what we look at it is that given the cost of debt and equity right now, that seems to be the best for our combined cost structure right now. Having said that, if we had a reason to ramp up our development pipeline in some way because of opportunities we had or some other things in our funding change, we would look at that. But I think, right now, debt and equity are our primary sources.
H. Eric Bolton: Certainly, David, we've been in the preferred market in years past. And if conditions weren't going back, we'll certainly do that.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: It seems like if you think about your cost of capital going up in the next couple of years and you can lock in a slice of it at a relatively attractive yield into perpetuity, it might be a nice option.
Albert M. Campbell: There's certainly a lot of demand for that in the marketplace, David.
David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Yes. And then my only other question, and forgive me if you touched on this, I'm still sort of struggling with the dynamics of the same-store guidance change and I sort of either, I guess, the sort of the changes either imply revenues are a little bit lower to hit the same midpoint as NOI or you're targeting the same revenues, but maybe NOI is going to come in a little bit lower? I guess, maybe help me through some of that dynamics in that range?
Albert M. Campbell: Right, okay. If you take a look at what we've done for the first 6 months, David, revenue's are about 4 6, expenses are 1 7, NOI's 6 6. And if you then compare that to what we have guidance for the full year, we have revenues of 4 to 5. So the midpoint of that is 4.5. So we expect revenues to continue to be solid and maybe that's implying a slight moderation in the fourth quarter, which we've talked about all year. On expenses, I think that's the key. We've had 1.7% increase first part of the year. And the implied guidance is 3.5%. And so, as I talked about, the pressure there is really real estate taxes. We have taxes, we believe, will increase 6% to 7% for the full year. You got to remember though, they're a quarter of operating expenses. And then on top of that this year, we have some challenging comparisons in taxes from the prior year. And the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year, we had some credits, we had some favorable appeals and had some valuations that came in better than we expected. So we had some credits in the back half of last year, making this year's back half a tough comparison for taxes. So, that's really the story of what's going on.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rob Stevenson from Macquarie.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Al, just to touch a little bit on the -- more on the property tax issue. When you're sitting here today and once you get past the back end of the year with these big increases, is the expectation that the year-over-year growth starts to moderate on the property taxes. I mean in most of your municipalities, are you up to as much fair value or you think that there's probably still more room to run either on the assessment or the mileage rate in some of these areas?
Albert M. Campbell: I think a good way to think about that, Rob, is looking at taxes over the long term. If you look at the last 6 years and you add them all to get an average, including this year, which is 6% to 7% growth, taxes have only -- that's less than 2% growth somewhere around 1 8, 1 9, and 1 7. Eric's got the number there. But -- so I mean long term, its -- we definitely expect it to be in that range. I think this year we and everyone expected the pressure particularly from tax -- particularly from the strong markets where there's been a lot of growth coming online. You may continue to see that a little bit over 2014, but you would expect over the next few years of that to kind of move into more of a normal band.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: Okay and when you look at the colonial portfolio, is that located in anywhere that's behind the times on the property tax issue. In other words, are there big jumps left there or are they move through things just like you have over the last couple of years?
Albert M. Campbell: I think you'll see they'd move through pretty close to us. And as they report today, and as you talk to them, I'm sure that you're seeing similar in taxes this year and probably have similar expectations going forward. And as we blend the portfolios, we don't see any major differences in the trends that we've seen.
H. Eric Bolton: Yes, they're still very similar footprints.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: All right. And then given the move in interest rates, does it have you guys -- you guys have done about half year disposition expectation for the year? Any inclinations given the interest rate sensitivity, probably, on some of your assets that you would probably want to sell of expediting that and raising that capital sooner rather than later?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, I mean, we're constantly looking at it, Rob. But we're pretty pleased with what we've been able to accomplish. We've -- as mentioned so far, we've got several others under contract right now and we are obviously in the process of taking a broader look at the combined portfolio and disposition plans. And I think that we will look at expediting perhaps a little bit more next year. But obviously we're also having to lay a lot of different crosscurrents here. But I think that, broadly speaking, we continue to believe that a steady, disciplined approach to recycling capital is the right approach. And we've demonstrated over the years, a clear ability to exit these secondary markets when it made sense because of where we were with the asset. And Fannie and Freddie continued to demonstrate a high degree of willingness to finance a lot of these assets. And so while we're going to continue to keep -- we certainly have a more aggressive posture in cycling this year than we've ever had. And we'll likely keep the same pace up, I would suspect, over the next year.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: And then, Al, help me understand, if I think about the 1 27 in the second quarter and maybe there's a couple of pennies of sort of nonrecurring stuff in there, then you've got the headwinds from the property taxes and you've just sold $70-some million of income producing assets, and so there's some level of drag from second quarter to third quarter on a core basis. But what would have to happen for you guys to fall all the way down from 1 27 into the 1 16, 1 15, 1 18 sort of range, what is the major driver of the bottom end of the range for both the third and fourth quarters?
Albert M. Campbell: Well, I think -- just to -- one thing, before the major drivers of that to help understand the third and fourth a bit, Rob, is third quarter has historically had its high level of operating expenses. It's the hot summer months and so that is -- if you go back and look, that has been in terms of FFO per share, that has shown volatility in the past and I think you'll see that again this year. In the fourth quarter, what you're going to see is because of our deal volume, we've moved a lot of that in the fourth quarter, we expect a lot of that to close in the fourth quarter. You have acquisition expenses there. And then we've put our deal further back in the year and so when we do the $350 million deal or whatever size we end up making it, we'll be taking our fixed rate debt from 88% fixed to about 93% fixed. So you'll feel that impact in the fourth quarter. So that right off the bat. And I think the major thing that could happen to push us to the bottom or at the top of that range really is significant changes in timing of these transactions, primarily dispositions and acquisitions and the big change in there. And obviously, fundamentals could change, occupancy changes would have a big impact. But I think acquisitions would be the biggest.
H. Eric Bolton: I would tell you, Rob, the biggest variability is the transaction timing that Al's mentioning. I mean we feel pretty good about the operating metrics and the trends there. It's the variability and the timing of transactions that really is the hardest thing to pin down and what drives the need for the range that we have.
Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research: And then just lastly, what's the current expectation for the stabilized yield on the development pipeline?
Albert M. Campbell: About 7.5 to 8 now, Rob.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: The stock is weak today and I guess maybe that has something to do with decelerating, I'm not condoning the move, but decelerating same-store in the second half shouldn't be a big surprise, but I guess it is. But the other thing is, Colonial is reporting, I know you're not commenting on them, but they produced 4.3% same-store revenue growth for the second quarter. Some might view that as distracted with the merger and all of that sort of stuff. But let's put that issue aside. I mean do you think that there is a kind of, do the 2 companies have a difference in theory about running property operations and do you think that you, MAA, could eke out more performance in that portfolio, putting aside the synergies and everything else, do you think that you're doing something differently that you can apply there?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, Rich, I mean, that's all to be more fully explored and demonstrated. I mean we are really into the weeds right now on putting the 2 platforms together and we will have a lot more to say about that particular subject after we sort of get the merger closed and we get into projecting 2014 and Q4 2013. But let me also just say that on this notion of decelerating fundamentals. It really, I just want to highlight the fact, we're talking about real estate taxes. Revenues are absolutely hanging in there. We absolutely feel good about the trend that we've posted so far this year and we'll continue to hold up. Revenues aren't moderating, expenses aren't going up with the exception of one line item and that's real estate taxes. And that happens to be because we had a tough prior year comparison because of a bunch of credits took last year, so...
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: If I said decelerating fundamentals, I didn't mean to say that, I meant decelerating internal growth and that's what I meant. And I'm in the camp that, it looks great, so you're preaching to the choir. But let me just ask you just once more on Colonial, did the 4.3% same-store revenue growth, was that in line with your expectations this quarter?
H. Eric Bolton: We didn't have expectations, we didn't define expectations. I will say this, Rich, I mean, clearly, it's been a busy period over the last 60 days since we've announced this transaction. And it's had a lot of focus from both companies. And it has been in some ways a trying time because we're having to put the 2 organizations together. And as I mentioned in my comments, there's a tough personnel decisions that come from that. So to assume or conclude that perhaps there was some pressure on the quarter as a result of all these other stuff going on, is not an unreasonable assumption to make.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: You mentioned earlier on the call that 20% of your turn was from people buying homes, 6.8% was people to go and rent a home and those were kind of in line with expectations. They kind of do sound a little bit higher than I thought, but maybe can you put that into context with what -- where it has peaked in the past? I don't think you've ever seen move-outs to buy a rental home as high as -- close to 7%, have you?
H. Eric Bolton: Well let me -- I'm going to give you just a perspective on this real quick and then I'm going to let Tom answer your question more specifically. But just to give you some context, this time last year, turnover associated with moving out to buying a home was running at around 19.6% or so. So it's been steady for the last couple of years. And move-outs to rent were 6% last year. We're at 6.8% now. So there's no noticeable trend that causes us any concern at this point. And then specific to your point, Tom?
Thomas L. Grimes: And, Rich, this builds on fundamentals a bit. The peak was March 2007 where move-outs to home buying were 33.4% of total turns. Important to note, I think, at that time, that our effective rent growth was 4.9%. And we believe that in the Sun Belt that a healthy home building industry and a healthy economy leads to people buying houses, people getting jobs and people renting plenty of apartments.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And then last question is on development. Obviously, Colonial brings an increased development pipeline to the table for you. I'm curious, I mean, I think you've addressed this, but I'm wondering if your thought process has changed a little bit on the longevity of your development strategy, is this going to be kind of Michael Jordan playing baseball or trying to give it a shot and then go back to basketball? Or are you going to stay with development for a while and make it a bigger part of your asset base?
H. Eric Bolton: The short answer is, we're not going to change our strategy, Rich. I continue to believe very much that we, first of all, want to be sure we have a platform by which we can direct capital into brand-new product, to-be-built product. But having said that, in this region of the country, I continue to believe that if a cycle is sort of a 6-year cycle that maybe there's a year to 2, where it makes sense to take on the risk of being the developer ourself. But we continue to believe that the bulk of the cycle in an effort to find opportunities to deploy capital in new construction and new development, that the best way to do that is be an opportunistic buyer of that. And we will bring the development team of Colonial on to our platform, which we're excited about because they are going to continue to be able to help us to work with developers to find opportunities to come in and provide capital, provide an opportunity for them to exit that development on a basis they find attractive, on a basis that we find very attractive. And ultimately, I believe, find ways to deploy capital and brand-new product that yields very, very close to what it would be if we were the developer ourself, but doing so without the risk on our balance sheet.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And just lastly on that, do you have a number of how big development will be as a percentage of your assets when you combine the company, and what your comfort level is longer term?
H. Eric Bolton: I would say $200 million to $250 million or close to a $9 billion balance sheet.
Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: That's your comfort level or that's...
Albert M. Campbell: That's about where we would go.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you guys could provide us with some July trends on rent and occupancy and what's happened since the end of 2Q?
H. Eric Bolton: Sure, Karin. July looked good, occupancy's still strong at 96%. Traffic was up 4.6%. And our asking rents on new lease prices was at 4.3%, which is really the best we've seen it this year.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: What about your renewal notices, what type of levels are you seeing further out?
H. Eric Bolton: Looking forward to the -- for the rest of the -- sort of out through October, is we're sending close to 6 and we're getting about 5 4 on that.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Next question is just on Texas. I heard your comments earlier about you don't feel like supply is really been hitting results there. Just taking a look at a market like Dallas, where year-over-year revenue growth slowed about 200 basis points from 1Q to 2Q. I just want to understand -- reconcile those two things and comments from some of your peers that a market like Dallas is starting to get impacted from -- by new supply and why do you think your portfolio is being insulated, if it is.
H. Eric Bolton: Karin, I don't think we mean to imply that new supply has no factor or bearing on a permanent pricing or the market. But I think what we're really trying to say is places like Dallas that are seen -- that have very healthy economy and are seeing some influx of new construction that job growth is at a point where fundamentals are still very, very good. And while there are some moderation to it, it is not the beginning of the end for a market like Dallas.
Albert M. Campbell: I would tell you, Karin, that one of the metrics that you hear talked about a lot, that we focused on a lot as well is sort of this comparison of jobs to new supply coming into a given market. And at least the information that we have from initial metrics and moodys.com and so forth suggest that in 2013 that, that metric is roughly around 10:1 jobs to every new unit. And in 2014 that jumps to 11:1. So -- and if equilibrium is around 5:1 or perhaps 6:1, clearly Dallas is showing a little moderation, but it's still going to be better than average and better than historical long-term run rate and we feel good about it.
Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then, just a last final question just on the mechanics of guidance. It looked like you guys had lowered expense growth guidance, about 50 basis points between 1Q and 2Q, but the other 2 components, revenue and NOI, stayed the same. I just -- was there any other -- was there any reason why NOI growth stayed the same even though you moved expenses down a little bit?
H. Eric Bolton: Not really. I mean that wasn't a significant change in that expense, Karin. And so we were not perfectly on the midpoint one way or the other that may move us to right on the midpoint of 5 on NOI somewhere closer to it. We're maybe a little above it before, but nothing significant.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Eric, you touched a little bit upon the acquisition market and disposition market. Can give us a sense of pricing? I mean we've seen a pretty big move in the -- from Fannie and Freddie rates over the last 90 days, is that impacting pricing in the secondary markets? And also, as you look out to the acquisition pipeline what's kind of your -- what should we expect in terms of pricing and what's kind of your expectation when we start to see some upward movement in cap rates?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, I mean, so far it hasn't really transitioned into the actual -- the cap rate market as far as we can see. And we continue to see deals in this past quarter that we were losing in the large markets that were trading somewhere between 4.5 to low 5 range. And the secondary market trading anywhere from 5 to 5.5 range for the kind of product that we're looking to buy. And so while NOIs are remaining pretty healthy, investor appetite is certainly very healthy despite the fact that interest rates have moved up a little bit, it hasn't really translated into any material -- certainly, material change in cap rates. We haven't really seen any change whatsoever, continue to -- in the properties that we're taking the market to sell, older properties in some of these secondary markets. I mean, they're moving fine and we've sold 4 properties so far this year at an average cap rate of 6 8. This is a 25-year-old product in small market. So no real change.
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just a second question, as a bigger picture question. As you looked across your markets, obviously supply ramping, when do you expect supply across your markets to peak? And then given that we've seen a little bit of backup in the multifamily housing start numbers here, what's kind of the expectation for peak supply across your markets?
H. Eric Bolton: I think it's going to be 2015, late 2014 and then sort of first half of 2015 .
Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And just a follow up to that is how are you managing accordingly? I mean, is it -- is there an apprehension starting new developments and focusing more so in acquisitions? And can we see a reacceleration in development than in '15?
H. Eric Bolton: Yes, I think this -- we're not planning to ramp up any more development, that's for sure. We think the best thing to do is be in a position to be on the sidelines ready to buy some of this product that gets delivered in late '14 and '15. That probably doesn't pencil out as well as a lot of people were hoping. And I think that it very well could be that by late 2015, 2016 that getting back into traditional development for a couple of years may make sense, we'll have to look at it at that point in time, but that's how we're preparing for it.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question. Eric, you mentioned that move-out to renting remained consistent in the 7% range, relatively unchanged in the last couple of quarters. But there continues to be a substantial amount of buying from the institutions in the Sun Belt markets. And it does take some time, 3, 4, 5 months for the homes to be renovated and rented. So I'm curious if you think the 7% is a bit of a ceiling? And how much higher do you think that number could go up?
H. Eric Bolton: Well, I don't think it goes a whole lot higher, Haendel. I mean maybe it goes to 7.5% or something, I don't know. I continue to believe, very much, though, that people make a decision on renting a home versus renting an apartment based on a lifestyle decision. And I think that a lot of people who are interested in renting these homes are folks who are previous homeowners become accustomed to that lifestyle and want that kind of product. The people that we're renting to by and large are sort of young professionals. And they're really not wanting that kind of a lifestyle. So I think that -- my point is -- the point I was trying to make in my call, or comments earlier, is our long-term run rate for many, many years was somewhere in the 4% to 5% range. We saw it kind of move up to 6% -- to 7% in the last year. So I just don't see it moving a whole lot more than that.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: You also mentioned that you think the U.S. Texas markets should be able to absorb the supply fairly well. Curious as to your view on the supply versus job dynamics in some of your Southeast markets, places like Charlotte, Raleigh, et cetera.
Albert M. Campbell: Now, Charlotte looks well-suited for it. Raleigh is one that's been a little bit of a surprise for us. It's at 5:1 ratio right now. And frankly, we would expect it to be a little bit softer. But it has worked very well. We've got an effective rent growth of close to 5% there and it's chugging along. I think the interesting dynamic on this is really job growth coming in 2014 for our Southeast secondary markets. And that they will begin to come to the table a little more aggressively as job growth really picks up in 2014.
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: One last one. You talked about no real change in buyer underwriting or cap rates here in the last 60 days. Curious if you're seeing any change -- or I guess no real change in cap rates, but I'm curious if you're seeing any change in buyer underwriting. And if so, how much of that has that changed?
H. Eric Bolton: Not for what we've seen, no real change. I think that we track all the deals that we don't get and try to understand as best we can what was it that the buyer that got the deal from us. Were they willing to accept a lower return? Or were they forecasting higher rent growth, what? Just what was it and we obviously can't get into all those. We don't get all that information. But I -- we haven't -- I mean, I think that to some degree it's probably people getting a little bit if their debt cost to capital cost are moving up a little bit and all things being equal the IRRs being the same requirements and so forth, I just assume they're being a little bit more aggressive on exit cap assumptions or rent growth assumptions or something, I don't know. But I think that broadly, the investor appetite just remains so high for this product type in both large and secondary markets that they're covering the difference somehow.
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of David Bragg from Green Street Advisors.
David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division: My questions have been answered.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I'm showing no additional audio questions at this time. I'll turn the conference back over to you.
H. Eric Bolton: Okay. Well, thanks, Howard. We appreciate everyone joining us this morning and we'll be talking to you soon. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-05-03 10:00:00) =====
Executives:  Leslie Wolfgang – SVP, Director-IR and Corporate Secretary Eric Bolton – Chairman and CEO Al Campbell – EVP and CFO Tom Grimes – EVP and CFO
Analysts:  David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald Rob Stevenson – Macquarie Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies Dave Bragg – Green Street Advisors Buck Horne – Raymond James 
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating in the MAA First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. The company will first share its prepared comments followed by a question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin.
Leslie Wolfgang: Thank you, Jonathan and good morning everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations for MAA. With me this morning are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to Safe Harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-X filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning’s call, will be available on our website. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Leslie. We appreciate everyone joining us this morning. FFO results for the first quarter of $1.25 per share were at the top end of our expectations and represented a record quarterly result. About half of the favorable performance was due to strong results in same-store operating expenses with the balance of the variance due to lower than expected G&A costs partially resulting from some timing differences versus our forecast. As Al will recap for you in his comments, we have increased the midpoint of our FFO guidance for the year to $4.87 per share as a result of the favorable Q1 result with some offset driven by earlier timing of balance sheet and financing plans. Same-store revenues for the quarter were in line with our expectation as pricing performance drove the results with effective rents increasing in every market across the portfolio. Top performances were captured in Austin, Dallas, Houston, and Nashville within our large market segment of the portfolio with Fredericksburg, Lexington, and Chattanooga delivering top results in our secondary markets. Resident turnover in the first quarter increased 3% as compared to Q1 last year and a 57% on a rolling 12-month basis. Resident turnover continues to trend lower than our long-term average. Move-outs associated with single-family home buying represented 20% of our move-outs in Q1 only a slight increase from 18% in Q1 of last year. Move-outs associated with single-family rental continue to not be a meaningful factor driving only 6% of our turnover in the quarter consistent with the results over the last several quarters. We continue to believe that a recovery in single-family market is a net positive factor for performance across our portfolio. It’s interesting to note that the top three markets driving 63% of the increase in move-outs during the quarter due to home buying which were Austin, Nashville, and Dallas also posted the strongest rent growth during the quarter. Taking a look at permitting activity and new supply trends, we continue to believe that at this part of the cycle – as this part of the cycle matures, our secondary market segment of the portfolio will generate a more stable performance profile and serve to offset some of the moderation associated with higher levels of supply in the larger markets. Permitting activity within our large market segment has clearly moved up, but it’s still about 10% below the peak level during 2006 and encouragingly permitting within our secondary market segment, it’s still only running at about 50% of where it was at the peak in 2006. More importantly, when looking at the demand side of the equation, job growth prospects continue to show improving trends and when compared to supply projections suggest that leasing fundamentals should continue to support healthy rent growth. Looking at updated projections and the ratio forecast in new job growth and permitting activity at a healthy 10 to 1 relationship we continue to believe that while leasing fundamentals and pricing trends would show some moderation from last year’s record performance, net absorption across some markets should remain strong and pricing trends should continue to exceed historical averages. We are actively underway with efforts to sell 11 properties in the portfolio with four of those under contract and expected to close soon. We continue to forecast total dispositions for the year in the $150 million to $160 million range. As noted in the earnings release during the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Milstead Village in Atlanta from our Fund I joint venture and expect to close on the one remaining property within the fund located in Houston during the second quarter. We are currently working on several other acquisition opportunities and remain comfortable with our guidance range for the year of $250 million to $300 million in wholly owned acquisitions. The market environment remains extremely competitive for fully and stabilized properties with cap rates holding steady. We’ve clearly seen investment capital move increasingly into some of our secondary markets. We continue to believe that our long established record for performing for sellers and extensive deal flow really yield us additional acquisition opportunities this year, work environment is clearly very competitive. As we enter the peak leasing season we feel good about the outlook for the year. We don’t see any evidence to suggest that the recovering single-family market is a meaningful threat to our ability to capture solid rent growth. And while new apartment deliveries are clearly accelerating, so long as the employment markets continue to show recovery as we expect they will, we believe that absorption will remain strong. That’s all I have in the way of prepared comments and I’ll now turn the call over to Al. Al?
Al Campbell: Thank you, Eric and good morning everyone. I’ll provide a few comments on earnings performance and balance sheet activity during the quarter and then I’ll highlight the key assumptions included in the updated guidance. FFO for the fourth quarter was $55.2 or $1.25 per share which represents a 12% growth over the prior year and $0.06 per share above the midpoint of previous guidance. About half, as Eric said, or $0.03 per share of the favorable performance compared to the original forecast came from the same store portfolio which produced 7.7% NOI growth compared to the prior year versus an expectation of about 6%. Revenue performance for the first quarter was in line with expectations supported by 4.7% growth in effective rents and stable occupancy levels. Operating expenses drove the favorability in the same store with personnel, repair and maintenance and real estate tax expenses combining to produce the majority of our performance for the quarter. Real-estate tax expenses in the first quarter benefited from favorable prior year appeals, which is expected to be offset over the remainder of the year by continued pressure on taxes in several of the key areas discussed before. The majority of the remaining out performance in earnings for the quarter was produced by G&A as bonuses, health insurance and professional fees were all below projections for the first quarter with a portion of the favorability related to timing differences. During the first quarter we acquired one community for Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, a 310 unit property located in Atlanta and entered an agreement to acquire the remaining community in the Fund, a 360 unit property located in Houston. And the gross combined purchase price is $59 million including an $18.3 million loans to be assumed by the company. MAA owns a one-third interest in Fund I which will be closed following these transactions and the company continues to hold and pursue joint venture investments through Mid-America Multifamily Funds II and III in the future. We continue to make good progress on the development pipeline during the first quarter. MAA now has three communities under construction with two others recently completing in the lease-up phase. Two lease-up communities both attained 82% occupancy during the quarter and they are expected to be stabilized in the second half of the year. We funded an additional $12.4 million for the completion of the three communities remaining under construction during the quarter and we took delivery and leased the first half of 2025 South Church located in Charlotte. We expect delivery of the remaining units during the second quarter. We also expect initial unit deliveries at River’s Walk in Charleston during the second quarter with 31 of the units already leased. Initial deliveries for 220 Riverside located in Jacksonville are expected in the second half of 2014. Our balance sheet ended the quarter in a great position. During the first quarter, we issued around 325,000 common shares through the ATM program at an average process of 68, 62 per share with total net proceeds of $22 million, which was primarily used to fund acquisition and development activity. We also repaid $75 million of additional secured borrowings during the quarter releasing the mortgages and increasing our unencumbered asset total over 57% of gross assets. The company is now in a good position to approach the public bond markets for future financing needs. At the end of the first quarter, the company leverage defined as net debt to gross assets was 43.7%, total debt was 6.3 times EBITDA, and MAA’s fixed charge coverage ratio was 4.5 times. At the end of the quarter, 90% of our outstanding debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates supporting a total leverage interest rate of about 3.6% for the quarter. We expect to increase our protection from rising interest rates with long-term fixed rate financings planned later this year. And just after quarter end, we executed $150 million of interest rate swaps effectively locking a portion of the interest rate on expected future financing transactions. Finally, given the first quarter performance and updated expectations, we are increasing our FFO guidance for the full year by $0.04 per share to midpoint. We are maintaining our same store guidance, which continues to project strong price and performance and stable occupancy producing 4% to 5% revenue growth for the full year. We expect operating expenses over the remainder of the year to increase in line with our original forecast as term costs begin to rise with growing leasing activity and re estate taxes reflect of upward pressure in key areas we discussed previously. We also expect timing of funding transactions for the year, primarily the planned bond financing and equity activity, to produce about $0.02 per share of dilution compared to the original forecast for the year as we move somewhat earlier than planned to lower execution risks. We’ve outlined the major assumptions for our guidance in the press release. In summary, we now expect our project diluted FFO per share for the full year to be 477 to 497 or 487 at the midpoint. Quarterly FFO per share is expected to be $1.16 to $1.28 for the second quarter, a $1.13 to a $1.25 for the third quarter and a $1.15 to $1.27 for the fourth quarter. Our quarterly guidance ranges continue to reflect the seasonality in our business as well as potential impact of timing on the significant acquisition, disposition and financing planned for the year. AFO for the full year is expected to $4.10 to $4.30 per share which represents a 66% payout at the midpoint. That’s all we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Jonathan I’ll turn the call over to you now for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question please.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald: Hey, good morning guys.
Eric Bolton: Hey, David.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald: Just a couple of sort of kind of detail questions. Did you disclose what the rent mix was in the first quarter in terms of growth for new versus renewals?
Tom Grimes: Sure, David, it’s Tom. I’ll rattle those off on the first quarter on a year-over-year basis new lease rates were 3.8%, renewals 4.9%, blended 4.3%.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald: Should we expect those kind of rates going forward through the rest of the year to be consistent with your total revenue expectation?
Tom Grimes: Total revenues were 4% to 5% for the year and it really is driven by pricing so, I would tell you that generally, yeah.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald: Are you seeing any kind of convergence in those rates at this point or are they still – are they maintaining a relatively consistent spread?
Tom Grimes: Right now, they’re staying pretty balanced and consistent. We’re not seeing anything closed certainly on that.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay, and then I guess how is that – how do we think about that versus the performance gap that we’re seeing between the (inaudible) group, the large and the secondary markets together from a revenue perspective. That gap seems to be closing a little bit at the revenue line. Is that more of a function of occupancy then?
Tom Grimes: No, I mean, I think what you’ll see is the large margins begin to moderate as new construction comes and play and it will begin – you will begin to see the secondary markets begin to pick up a little bit as their advantage and deliveries begins to show. The timing on that couldn’t exactly predict for you, but we don’t think the Texas is going to roll the way Texas has been rolling for the infinite future is just being great for us, but at some point we’ll begin to moderate.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald: And just one last question, so a year from now, maybe we expect that we could expect that the gap between the revenue performance for those two buckets to be a little bit closer than it is today, sounds like?
Tom Grimes: Yes, we would think that our crystal ball sometimes is foggy but that’s what we would anticipate at this point.
David Toti – Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay. Thanks for the detail.
Tom Grimes: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson from Macquarie. Your question please.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Good morning, guys. Can you talk a little bit about some of the markets that have been a bit of a surprise operationally to you to the upside and downside thus far in the year relative to expectations?
Tom Grimes: Sure, Rob, I mean, I have probably historically underestimated Texas’ strength a little bit, I mean, it is – it’s encouraging to see what it is continue to do and then I think Jacksonville is a real bright spot. I think a lot of folks have thought that it was not a great place to be and its performance was 5% revenue stable occupancy and growing rents is pretty encouraging. On the little bit slower side and not really surprising seeing some of the things – we would have expected I think the secondary markets to come in a little stronger in places like Columbus, Georgia but that is a market that has the ability to do great things, it’s just been a little slow lately.
Eric Bolton: Yeah, I will tell you Rob, this is probably the biggest worry bead in the portfolio now to me would be Raleigh. I think that’s a market broadly just getting a lot of supply. It’s kind of all over the city and I think that’s probably one of the weaker markets I would expect over the next 6 to 8 quarters, but as Tom says Texas just continues to be quite strong. There is a lot of supply picking up in the Texas markets, but the job growth engine there is so robust it just continues to handle it. But all-in-all, we do think the secondary markets will continue to show growing strength as we get into next year in particular.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Alright and then Al, I mean you guys did only 60 basis points of expense increase. When you look out over the year, I mean is – does this bode, is it just a timing issue or are you, sort of, at four months through the year now? Are you guys running ahead of what your expectations were for expense growth for the full year?
Al Campbell: Well, thank you. First quarter was better than we expected. There is no question, Rob, and as we talked about really that was couple of things real estate taxes and really turn costs. And taxes are somewhat timing and that we’ve got some favorable appeals in the first quarter and we continue to expect pressure in the back half of the year, so it is somewhat timing. And on the turn costs we certainly have down in our forecast rising turn costs over this year as we talked about. We expect that will be the case in the second, third, and fourth quarters and especially as we get into more leasing activity in the second and third quarter. So, we saw some benefit in the first quarter that was some timing and some unexpected favorable surprise. And in terms of our guidance we carry that through the back half of the year that performance, but our same-store performance as it was is intact and so we expect it from the second quarter on to be about what we thought.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay, and then just the last question. Eric, when you take a look at the supply that’s coming online is some of your bigger – of the sort of larger markets, what’s going on with construction costs there? I mean are the numbers still working for people if they stick a shovel in the ground today or six months from now from a numbers standpoint when you consider land costs and then plus what you have see in terms of inflation, in terms of material and labor?
Eric Bolton: I think it’s getting tougher Rob. I was at a meeting last week with a number of developers talking about the growing pressures surrounding lumber costs and labor costs in particular and if the single-family housing market continues to pick up and you continue to see building taking place there, the labor situation for the multifamily developers is only going to get tougher. And I think that this rising pressure on construction costs and development costs could begin to act as a bit or a moderator to the level supply heading into ‘14, ‘15 kind of delivery. So, from a perspective of not being a big developer, I’m kind of encouraged to see these trends picking up. I think it is starting to create pressure and these fields are not penciling out as well as they were a year ago.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay, and then I lied. One last question, may I know have you guys given the tier in the market with the properties for sale, have you guys seen any sort of impact thus far from the presumed changes to Fannie and Freddie financing?
Al Campbell: Not really at this point Rob, we’re certainly seeing a lot of people bidding on projects we’re seeing pricing be about what we thought and as we reflect in our continued guidance. So, at this point we’ve really haven’t seen much impact in that.
Eric Bolton: And frankly we’re seeing some of the life companies coming in increasingly to some of these markets offering some incredibly attractive terms 7.5, seven year money. And so we’re not seeing any financing issues that cause us to worry about our ability to continue to cycle capital out of these secondary markets.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Is that – are the life guys going to smaller and regional guys or is this basically available to you and the other sort of bigger players only?
Eric Bolton: They are certainly going broader than they have in the past I think because they see multifamily is a good industry in a pretty good yield and given the risk they are not going to go to some of the markets but they go broader than they have in the past which is supporting the market.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Hi, good morning guys. Just, following-up on the disposition question, can you give us a sense how dispositions are going to play out for the year just based upon what your marketing – maybe how much you expect to close in the quarter and kind of what you think it’s going to close in the back half of the year?
Al Campbell: Yeah Mike, we’ve got as Eric mentioned I think in his comments we’ve got four assets under contract. I think we would expect us to close near the last part of the second quarter maybe one or two spill into the very first part of the third quarter and that’s about half of the plan for the year. After that they are fairly evenly spread probably another group in the third quarter and another group in the fourth quarter of roughly equal sizes.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: And you’re still thinking late second quarter, early third quarter in terms of the unsecured debt issuance. And also just in terms of being a first time issuer, what kind of spread are you expecting at this point?
Al Campbell: Yeah Mike, we – as we’ve talk about I think in our original guidance we had it occurring late July, early August, we have moved that up a little bit just because the market is in really good shape obviously our balance sheet is in great shape. We are ready to go to the market and it’s just timing of when we need the money at this point. The market is red hot. You’ve seen a lot of deals come through at very good spreads and obviously treasuries remain low. So, we believe if we went to the market right now we can get of treasury somewhere in the 175 to 200 over treasuries for the applicable period, which if you do the math on that, at the high end of that, you are at 3.25% for a 10-year deal. And that’s pretty good, that’s inside of inside of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That’s a good pricing. We would hope to do that or even a little better assuming current conditions and so, we’re moving as quickly as we can given the dilution on how the other factors in our plan to execute on that strategy.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Switching gears here to operations, did you get April leasing trends and I think you mentioned a 4.3% blended increase – average increase in the first quarter. What was that versus the first quarter of 2012?
Tom Grimes: It was up versus 2012, excuse me, honestly I don’t have that, I think it’s down, we are expected there is some moderation there first quarter, it was down of – first quarter of ‘12 was a little around 7% blended.
Eric Bolton: We would definitely expect the rent growth trajectory to be a little lower this year then it was last year so, that’s not unexpected but blended 4.3%, I don’t know off the top of my head what it was for Q1 last year, but it was I’m sure north of that.
Tom Grimes: Yeah.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, fair enough. And finally, Eric, can you just touch upon, kind of, the acquisition pipeline, I know the first quarter is usually slow, but how is that firming and kind of, what are you seeing in terms of pricing difference right now between your primary and secondary markets?
Eric Bolton: Well, we are looking a lot of things right now, Mike, it’s – as I said pretty darn competitive. We still feel good about $250 million to $300 million guidance that we have out there. We’ve got couple of deals under contract currently that are going to due diligence so, I can’t comment on the certainty that they’ll close but they’re looking pretty good. I would tell you that we’re routinely seeing for the quality of the assets that were after the pricing in the large markets versus secondary markets versus secondary markets, the GAAP is probably around 50 basis points, I mean, pricing running 5.5% to 6% in the secondary markets and 5% to 5.5% in the larger markets and it’s particularly for the stabilized deals it’s super competitive, but pricing is holding up real strong.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: I appreciate the color guys. Thank you.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon from Robert W. Baird. Your question please.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird: Eric, given your comments on construction costs, what is your appetite for continuing to do the one or two development deals a year and are you still getting a healthy volume of inbound calls from those private or regional developers with attractive projects that you’d be interested in?
Eric Bolton: But we definitely are feeling a lot of those phone calls, Paula and that continues to be our favored way pursing development opportunities. We – I’ll tell you I’m probably had a bit more cautious about it today then I would have been a year ago just given the volume that we are seeing – what we are seeing is increasing – increasingly more developers who are interested in a presale and taking the risk off the table sooner rather than later and so, we went to a period sort of towards the end of last year where the conversations were more around with the developers wanting to have a continued interest of some hype in the project sort of once we got stabilized, there were some sort of promoter, some sort of back-end opportunity that they could continue to participate in. Today, the conversation at least from what we are seeing is a little bit more urgent and they are not as aggressive about wanting to stay in and they are little bit more interested in wanting to get a certainty of giving out, which I think says something and about, sort of, what the developers, I mean there is obviously a lot of talk about supply so, I just think it’s a time to be prudent and cautious and we have not – we don’t have any other development situation or opportunities underway right now and if someone comes to us with a really compelling opportunity we would certainly have an interest in it, but we are – I think a lot of the supply that it’s going to get delivered in ‘14 and ‘15 is going to create some good buying opportunities, and we are okay with being patient.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird: Thanks very much. That’s all I have.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Paula.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Your question please.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies: Yeah quick question. Just in regards to transaction markets. I mean, you guys are saying things are very competitive right now. Does that compel you to consider selling more assets and specifically selling more assets in primary rather than secondary markets?
Eric Bolton: Not really I mean our disposition strategy is really built around the idea of continuing to cycle capital out of investments that we feel like have margins that we can do better with. And that really is to process that we go through to decide where – which assets to sell and it’s not so much a market driven decision as much as it’s after CapEx almost if you will and AFFO margin decision that drives our selection process. And so we’re selling in large markets and we’re selling in secondary markets but the idea that we need to monetize a bunch of investments because of some portfolios shift or strategic objective that we have we don’t really have that concern of that need. So we – that $150 million to $160 million maybe $175 million range it’s a level that we think is about what we’re very comfortable with, we’re comfortable with ability to redeploy that capital and keep manage the earnings process through this and so that’s kind of the way we’re approaching it and I think you will continue to see that over the next couple of years.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies: That’s helpful. And when I just kind of think about guidance, this quarter, your prior guidance, the midpoint was $1.19, you guys came in at $1.25 which is a $0.06 beat, but you raised overall guidance for 2013, the midpoint by $0.04. So, I was kind of curious why just the $0.04 raise versus at least the $0.06 just to account for the 1Q beat?
Al Campbell: Tayo, this is Al. The $0.06 as you mentioned $0.03 call it same-store performance, $0.03 G&A and other items did carry through the year, but that’s all set by couple of cents of items that as talked about earlier and mentioned the Mike’s question. We are changing the timing of some of our transactions here, the bond transaction a little bit sooner, and if you saw we raised if you put together our plans this year and we talk about before we think we’ll need around $25 million in equity for the full year to maintain our leverage given the dispositions and everything we have going on. So, you can see we have done most of that in the first quarter. So, that was a little bit earlier than we had originally planned. Those two things cost about $0.02 neg against the $0.06.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies: Got it. Thank you very much. Great quarter.
Eric Bolton: Thank you.
Al Campbell: Thanks Tayo.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg from Green Street Advisors. Your question please.
Dave Bragg – Green Street Advisors: Thank you. Good morning. In your press release you left the door open to more future joint venture purchases. Can you just talk about under what circumstances we should expect to see this from you and how the level of interest from partners compares to recent years?
Eric Bolton: Well, Dave, we have – we mentioned two funds. Fund II and fund III actually Fund II is a fund that is sort of kept off we really only have one investor that we do business with one probably capital investor and the only fund we really active if you will and looking to add new assets to Fund III. Having said that, that fund in our strategy for using the fund is really get towards value add acquisitions looking for properties that we define is being seven years of age or older that we can go in we have and those particular types of transactions particularly in today’s market are very, very hard to find in terms of pricing that we feel comfortable with fully stabilize assets at that level are very easily financed. And so we really have not dialed into our forecast this year any expectation doing any more JV acquisitions this year. Having said that, we’re still looking at them and we’re still being given opportunities to bid on them. But the pricing is just very, very frothy particularly in that market given the financing availability.
Dave Bragg – Green Street Advisors: Okay, thank you. And Eric, we have spoken about this many times in the past, but given the increased level of purchases from single-family rental investors, especially in Atlanta and Phoenix and it seems as though those two markets slowed disproportionately for you in the first quarter. Are you observing more competition from the single-family rental asset class than you were, say, a year ago?
Tom Grimes: Hey, Dave, this is Tom. That hasn’t changed at all at this point in terms of move outs. Atlanta, I think it has the ability to pick up steam here in the very near future, we have one property that was off which was really some people changes that we’ve made adjustments on that pulled the market down a little bit and that group closed at 95.7 and we’ve got a nice pop and occupancy which will hope to drive revenues in Atlanta. Phoenix is an encouraging story all around, I’m optimistic about where it’s going particularly our assets to the north is surrounded by the great deal of infrastructure in business construction. So, well, with single family of rentals is the factor it is not at this point, the factor that’s changed much.
Eric Bolton: I think Dave just as you say talk about this lot. I do think that we continue to believe that the single family rental threat is not a meaningful threat for us. We’ve been at 6% of our turnover due to move outs for home renting for now probably 8 to 10 quarters. If that number would have – let’s say it moves to 8% and it’s never been that I don’t see a giving proportionately a lot of worsen it is right now, I mean, going back several years ago, the lowest it’s ever been is about 4% so, it’s kind of hang in a very steady level and I continue to just believe that people make their decisions in terms of renting a home versus renting apartment for a lot of lifestyle reasons and the people we’re catering to just really I think are going to continue to favor the apartment rental over the home rental.
Dave Bragg – Green Street Advisors: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Dave.
Tom Grimes: Thanks, Dave.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your question please.
Buck Horne – Raymond James: I was just wondering if you have any recent statistics on rent-to-income ratios for new leases signed.
Eric Bolton: Yeah, sure. The portfolio average for rent income ratio is about 17%, which is still down from the 19% or a peak sort of the part of the recession and then March is, sort of today’s incomes on today’s rents is 16.7.
Buck Horne – Raymond James: That’s great, thank you and any comment on foot traffic in the communities this leasing season and one quick one for Al. I just wondered if you could help quantify the magnitude of the property tax swing you’re thinking you’ll see later this year.
Al Campbell: Sure. On the first quarter foot traffic was right where we needed to be to so essentially flat with last year and then really look at April is that it’s picked up a little bit on – in the 3% range, but just still positive and exactly what we needed to be.
Eric Bolton: Buck, I’ll answer you on the taxes. In first quarter, given the – we have projected for the full year of about 6%, 5.5% to 6.5% guidance still believe that’s correct. The first quarter was little over 3% because of some of the credits we got because of the assessments and appeals that were favorable. So you can do some math on that. We are – we would say that the second, the third, and fourth quarter higher, probably second quarter 4% to 5% and little higher in the third and fourth, just because comparisons from credits and things we had in the prior year.
Buck Horne – Raymond James: Alright, that’s very helpful. Thank you guys.
Eric Bolton: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today’s program. I would like to handle the program back to Eric for any further remarks.
Eric Bolton: Thank you. I appreciate everyone joining us this morning and we’ll look forward to seeing everyone at NAREIT in a few weeks. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2012 Q4  (2013-02-07 10:00:00) =====
Executives:  Leslie Wolfgang – Director, IR Eric Bolton – Chairman and CEO Al Campbell – EVP and CFO Tom Grimes – EVP and COO
Analysts:  Karin Ford – KeyBanc Rob Stevenson – Macquarie Gaurav Mehta – Cantor Fitzgerald Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets Paula Poskon – Robert Baird Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets Buck Horne – Raymond James Tayo Okusanya – Jefferies Carol Kemple – Hilliard Lyons 
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating in the MAA Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. The company will share its prepared comments followed by a question-and-answer session. At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin.
Leslie Wolfgang: Thank you, Tammie and good morning everybody. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations for MAA. With me this morning are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments, I want to point out that as part of the discussion this morning, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-X filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call, will be available on our website. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate you joining us this morning. As outlined in yesterday’s earnings release, MAA wrapped up 2012 in a strong fashion generating same-store NOI growth of 8.5% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, same-store NOI increased 6.6%. In 2013, we expect another year of solid same-store results with NOI increasing in a range of 4% to 6%. We don’t believe the current pipeline of new apartment construction in our markets and submarkets is sufficient to materially weaken leasing fundamentals during 2013. The outlook for continued recovery and job growth across our portfolio along with positive demographic trends are expected to generate continued growth and demand and net positive absorption. Across our large tier market segment of the portfolio, the ratio of new jobs to new unit deliveries is expected to remain very healthy in 2013 at almost 9:1, while the secondary market segment of the portfolio will be slightly stronger at close to 12:1. During the fourth quarter, resident turnover declined 4.5% as compared to the prior year. Move-outs to buy a home declined 1.8%. Move-outs to rent a home moved up only slightly from 5% to 6% during the quarter and remain an insignificant factor in driving resident turnover. The number of new resident move-ins in the fourth quarter increased 2.5% when compared to the prior year. Effective rent across the same-store portfolio grew 4.8% in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, new lease rents grew 3.2% in the fourth quarter. Renewal pricing for existing residents on a lease-over-lease basis increased an average of 5.5%. We continue to make progress on positioning the balance sheet for broader access to the unsecured debt market. We ended the year with over 52% of the portfolio unencumbered and expect to see the unencumbered asset pool grow in 2013. As reported a couple of weeks ago, S&P issued an initial investment grade rating on MAA, a BBB-minus with a positive outlook. Leasing continues to go well on our new development projects in Nashville and Little Rock with rents running ahead of pro forma. Initial occupancy started last month at our new lease-up in Charlotte and while still early in the process, we’re on track to meet expectations at this Phase II project. Construction is underway at our project in Charleston and we expect to begin pre-leasing late this quarter. We’re excited about our new project in Jacksonville that broke ground in Q4. Our 220 Riverside project is located in a highly desirable urban location across the street from the headquarters of three of the city’s largest employers. It’s adjacent to Unity Park, Jacksonville’s newest urban park and is within easy walking distance of the city’s Riverside Arts Market. We expect the acquisition environment to remain competitive in 2013 as capital continues to chase yield and investment opportunity. We’ve modeled $250 million to $300 million of wholly-owned acquisitions in 2013, which is down slightly from the $345 million in acquisitions completed in 2012. In our base case modeling for 2013, we’ve not assumed any additional JV acquisitions as we expect the environment for value add or repositioning place to remain very pricey. Our strategy and approach for deploying capital remains consistent with the focus on both large and secondary markets across our Sunbelt footprint. As noted in our earnings release, we expect to increase our disposition activity again this year with dispositions ranging from $150 million to $160 million. We remain committed to a steady program of recycling capital from lower after-CapEx margin investments into higher margin properties. As we head into 2013, our performance objective for shareholders remains centered on strengthening MAA’s full cycle performance platform. As increasing levels of new construction come online in 2014 and 2015, we expect our disciplined approach to investing, across both large and secondary markets, combined with a significantly strengthened balance sheet will position the company to both capture steady external growth and generate superior stable, long-term, same-store results. I’m going to now turn the call over to Al to update you more on Q4 and 2013 guidance. Al?
Al Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. I’ll provide a few comments on earnings performance for the fourth quarter and on our balance sheet. And then I’ll outline the key assumptions included in the 2013 guidance. FFO for the fourth quarter was $53.4 million or $1.21 per diluted share, which represents 13% growth over the prior year and a $0.06 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. About two-thirds or $0.04 per share of this favorability from expectations was produced by property performance with $0.03 related to the same-store portfolio and another $0.01 related to development in recent acquisition properties. Revenue performance for the fourth quarter was essentially in line with expectations, while utilities, repair and maintenance and real estate tax expenses combined and produced the majority of this favorability for the quarter with roughly equal contributions. An additional $0.02 per share was related to interest expense and acquisition costs for the quarter primarily due to no acquisitions occurring during the fourth quarter. FFO for the full year was $196.3 million or $4.57 per share, which is a record for the company and represents 15% growth over the prior year. During the fourth quarter, we sold one additional community for $13.6 million completing recycling plans for the year and bringing year-to-date gross proceeds from dispositions to about $113 million. And as Eric mentioned, we continue to make good progress on the development pipeline. During the fourth quarter, we funded an additional $20.5 million toward completion, leaving just over $57 million to complete all projects currently underway. You’ll notice in the supplement to the release that the total – our disclosure of total estimated cost for the development project has been revised. The total cost presented now represents all costs expected to be capitalized for the projects instead of primarily construction-related costs included in the prior disclosure. And I should note that the projected cash flows and expected returns for these projects remain intact and well above our investment hurdle rate. Our balance sheet ended the quarter in great position and we continue progress towards achieving full and efficient access to the public debt market. During the quarter, we issued around 343,000 common shares to the ATM program at an average price of $65.67 per share for total net proceeds of $22.2 million which was primarily used to fund development activity. Also, as Eric mentioned, in January, we received a first time issuers rating from Standard & Poor’s which reflects the strength of our balance sheet and really completes our goal of receiving investment grade ratings from all three rating agencies. We plan to put these ratings to good use in 2013 which I’ll discuss just a bit more in just a moment. Now, I’ll turn to earnings guidance for 2013, and we’ve outlined the major assumptions in the supplement to our release, but in summary, we projected diluted FFO per share for the full year of $4.83, the midpoint of our projected range of $4.73 to $4.93 per share. FFO is expected to be between $1.13 and $1.25 for the first quarter, $1.18 and $1.30 for the second quarter, $1.12 and $1.24 for the third quarter and between $1.16 and $1.28 for the fourth quarter. Our quarterly guidance range reflects the potential impact of timing of our significant transaction disposition and financing activity planned for the year. The primary driver of 2013 growth is expected to be continued strong performance from the same-store portfolio. Our estimate includes full year same-store NOI growth of 4% to 6%, based on a 4% to 5% growth in revenues and a 3.5% to 4.5% growth in operating expenses. We expect solid pricing performance to continue in 2013 with some moderation as we move into the back half of the year. And our estimate is based on occupancy levels remaining essentially constant with pricing growth in the 4% to 4.5% range. We expect real estate taxes, which remember represent about a quarter of our operating expenses, to produce the largest increase in expenses project to grow 5.5% to 6.5% over the same-store portfolio in 2013. Our guidance includes acquisitions of wholly-owned communities of $250 million to $300 million including the planned acquisition of two communities from Fund I, our joint venture with Fannie Mae. We also plan to sell $150 million to $160 million of wholly-owned communities during the year and our cap rate expectations for acquisitions are in the 5.5% to 6% range with disposition cap rate expected to be about 100 basis points higher on average. We expect to fund an additional $40 million to $50 million on the development pipeline to 2013 with no new developments currently planned. We also expect to spend an additional $8.5 million of redevelopment capital on the interior renovation program and on recent acquisition communities combined. Capital spending on the existing properties is projected to be around $41 million or $840 per unit with $30 million going to our recurring capital expenditures and an additional $11 million toward revenue enhancing projects. Other key assumptions include plans to refinance about $150 million of existing debt, prepaying a portion of our 2014 maturities. We do currently plan to access the public bond market in 2013, most likely in the back half of the year as we continue to transition our balance sheet, fund growth and broaden our cap resources. We expect our leverage to find as debt to gross assets to range between 43% and 45%, while we expect our unencumbered asset portfolio to increase to a range of 55% to 60% of gross assets by year-end. Interest costs are expected to be 3.8% to 4% for the full year of course depending on the timing of financing transactions mentioned earlier. We anticipate combined property management and G&A expenses to be between $37 million and $38 million for the year, declining about 20 basis points as a percent of total revenue. That’s all that we have in the way of prepared comments. Tammie, I’ll turn the call over to you for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Karin Ford of KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc: Hi, good morning. Just wanted a quick question on your fourth quarter revenue growth, just looking specifically at the large markets, but I guess it applies to both. You posted 7.1% revenue growth, but it looks like rent was up 5.9% and occupancy was up 10 basis points. So was ancillary income – could you explain the gap and why was that up so much on a year-over-year basis?
Tom Grimes: Thanks for asking that question, Karin. It’s two pieces of it and you mentioned one. Ancillary income is a component of that. We’ve been able to push through larger cable increases in our larger market groups and that’s showing up a part of it. And the other piece of it is we’re reporting our quarter end fiscal occupancy in our average fiscal occupancy for the quarter for the large markets group was up 70 basis points. So it’s a pretty big driver of it as well.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you. Next question is, can you just talk about what the post quarter trend has been in January, what’s occupancy today and where have renewal increases been so far this year?
Tom Grimes: Sure. It’s continuing on with – it’s very good trajectory occupancy. At the same point, it was last year at 95.5%. And our renewal increases, we’re getting around a little above 6% right now.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc: Okay, great. And last question is just a bigger picture one for, Eric. Can you just talk about your view on the right size of the development pipelines for Mid-America at this point in the cycle and do you expect it to be increasing or decreasing here as we push through 2013?
Eric Bolton: I would tell you, Karin, that we’re – as Al mentioned, we haven’t delved in any expectation starting anything new in this year other than the 220 Riverside project in Jacksonville. Having said that, we continue to look at a number of opportunities and developers continue to approach us. It’s conceivable that we might do another project or two. Broadly speaking, we are comfortable carrying roughly somewhere around $150 million to as much as $200 million of development on the balance sheet. We just continue to believe in the strategy for us that make sense is to be more focused on looking for opportunistic buys of some of these new constructions that is going to be coming out of the ground particularly in 2014 or 2015. We think that over time, we’re able to generate better returns for capital and certainly take on a risk adjusted basis that we’re better able to just be there in 2014 and 2015 while this new project comes out of the ground. All of it won’t work and there maybe some that ultimately provides a better way to bring that new product in the portfolio. Having said that, as I mentioned don’t be surprised if we announced another deal or two this year. But with the other projects leasing up as well as they are and the funding pretty well set, we feel like we could probably start another one or two if we find the opportunity.
Karin Ford – KeyBanc: Great. Thanks for the color.
Tom Grimes: Thank you, Karin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Good morning, guys. Just a follow up on the last question on development. What’s the expected stabilized yield on those three projects in the pipeline today?
Al Campbell: Rob, this is Al. It’s about 7.5% to 8%. That really hasn’t changed, and so that’s the expectations.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay.
Al Campbell: So lease up is going well, we’re meeting those targets.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay. So with those projects coming in and the other projects coming out from basically being in leased up, it’s still 7% to 8%, you said?
Al Campbell: It is that the latest project is at the lower end of that, I think, because it’s a different point in the cycle. But 7.5% to 8% for that group is the right number.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay. And then if I think about the $121 million you did in the fourth quarter, Al, what has to happen? What’s the two or three major levers that would drop you towards the low end of your first quarter guidance range?
Al Campbell: We’ve got a couple of things going on in Q1, Rob. One is a little bit of normal seasonality as the winter leasing season plays out in the first quarter, but then you have some timing as some SG&A cost really bigger in the first quarter related to some gearing work and some things that we had going on with our bond program this year that we expect in the first quarter. So that’s causing the largest part of that decrease. And I think to go beyond that to the bottom end of the range, you’d have to have some transaction timing that we have planned in the year be significantly different in that first quarter.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay. So, basically, you’d have to sell $160 million at some point already in the past here to get that type of dilution?
Al Campbell: Yeah. If you look at the quarterly guidance, I think for the year, yeah, you have to assume like you sold assets faster than we thought. We bought assets later than we thought, I’m taking for a negative result, and things like that. And then, obviously, our same-store performance that we didn’t quite meet the targets there that we had set out. We don’t think that’s the case, but that’s what the guidance range is there to cover.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay. And then can you guys talk about what the – how much non-core assets you guys have today? I mean, you guys are targeting $150 million to $160 million of dispositions. I mean, what’s the size of the entire – when you take a look at your portfolio today that if you had an opportunity to redeploy proceeds, I mean what’s the size of the potential disposition over the next couple of years for you guys?
Eric Bolton: Well, we don’t really, to be honest with you, Rob, we don’t have a core versus a non-core definition. For us, we don’t have really any desire to make any sort of strategic shift from our footprint, no strategic shift from our allocation between large and secondary. We like the strategy. Having said that, our disposition program is driven by, I believe though it’s just prudent to cycle out some of the large margin investments every year. We’ve gotten to a point now with coverage ratios and other aspects of the balance sheet now able to support a little bit more of a robust effort as it relates to recycling. We think going far for the next couple of years or more that something around $150 million to $170 million is likely what we will be doing every year going forward.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay. And then lastly, what’s your view today on moving further Northern Virginia? Does any of the sort of issues that you’re seeing in sort of north of the core, sort of Northern Virginia, DC, suburbs make you hesitate about moving further north? Do you see opportunity, something that you guys have been taking a more active look at these days?
Eric Bolton: We have been looking more in Northern Virginia. We certainly don’t envision going into DC itself and I think that really doesn’t fit with what we’re trying to do from a strategy perspective. But, Northern Virginia certainly is a market that we continue to like. We’ve added a couple and are looking at some other opportunities up there now.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Are you seeing better opportunities today as a result of concerns about sequestration and things like that or is it still a pretty tight surprising market in your view?
Eric Bolton: It’s still pretty tight, it’s still pretty tight.
Rob Stevenson – Macquarie: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Rob.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gaurav Mehta of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Gaurav Mehta – Cantor Fitzgerald: Good morning.
Eric Bolton: Good morning.
Al Campbell: Good morning.
Gaurav Mehta – Cantor Fitzgerald: Couple of question on your guidance. So, if I look back, your large market had been outperforming your secondary market. What do you expect in 2013? Do you expect the gap to widen or narrow and would you be able to break down your NOI guidance by large and secondary markets?
Eric Bolton: Well, broadly speaking, we think that given the ratio of new job growth to supply that I mentioned earlier, and the fact that the ratio is actually stronger in the secondary markets in 2013 as compared to what it was in 2011 and the fact in the large markets, that ratio weakened slightly in 2013 as compared to 2012, we don’t think that the gap gets any wider. We think that 2013 is probably an inflection year and that the secondary markets will perform in a more aligned or closer to the large markets. It just really depends on how much supply does come into some of the larger markets in 2014 and 2015. But I’d certainly expect that by the time we get to late in 2013 and into 2014 that the gap is fairly narrow between the two segments in terms of their performance. And just depending on, again, how the supply picture works out and how the economy and job growth picture works out, we very well could see the secondary market performance begin to pick up and surpass large markets at some point down the road. That’s really the piece of our whole strategy is to try to create a more, in aggregate stable level of performance by trading off a little bit between the large and the secondary markets.
Gaurav Mehta – Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay. That’s Helpful. Second question I have is on your balance sheet. So, if I look at your guidance, it looks like you’re expecting $0.01 debt refinancing charge in 2013. And then you also talked about your desire to access public bond market. So can you perhaps expand on your refinancing activities in 2013? When I look at your maturity table, it seemed like you don’t have any debt expiring in 2013. So would you be looking to refinance perhaps from that from 2014 and 2015?
Al Campbell: Well, that’s a good point. I think, in general, we don’t have to do anything in 2013. As you mentioned, we have no maturities, but we do have plans to continue our progress and do a couple of things. One, to continue increasing our unencumbered asset portfolio. As we talked about, our targets are 55% to 60%, which we think is – 60% is where long-term we think we want to be. Also to increase our fixed rate protection, so we think that in the end of the year, we’ll be closer to somewhere call it 93% to 95% of our debt fixed and which is taking a little bit higher. It’s a good time to do that and it’s something we want to do to protect the balance sheet. So, I think those two things are part of our plans and to execute that we do plan to be in the – and obviously, we want to put our ratings, the progress that we’ve made to this point, it’s a good use in 2013. So we plan to go to bond market probably the back half of the year to do a transaction. A good way to model it would be a transaction that’s the minimal size to be index eligible at somewhere in treasury plus 200 basis points. Hope we can beat that, but given a first-time issuer in those kind of things, that’s kind of how we look at it and the plans that we have. And then also the funds of that will be used to knock down the 2014 maturity stock that you see there and get us ahead of that.
Gaurav Mehta – Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay. And then last question I have is on your JV. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you’re not looking to acquire anything via JV. Is that because of the economics that do not make sense for you or you do not have interest from the JV partners? And also what are your thoughts on future development via JVs?
Eric Bolton: Well, the expectation at least in our initial guidance that we won’t have any JV acquisitions is purely just a function of we think the market to buy and that those sort of value adds older properties which is what our JV is focused on doing. The pricing in that market is just really frothy right now and we’ve not been able to make any deals work as those projects are easy to finance. Frankly, buyers are able to get a little bit more creative with some of their underwriting. And we just see that the pricing is really tough to make work right now in that regard for the older products. JV for development probably not something we’re interested in doing. We continue to believe that the right approach for JV or for development is for us is essentially a pre-purchase model. It’s not to say we would never consider it. But at this point, it’s certainly not something we’re focused on doing.
Gaurav Mehta – Cantor Fitzgerald: Thank you. That’s all I had.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Hey, thanks. Good morning folks.
Eric Bolton: Good morning, Rich.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Hey, Al, I just noticed one thing about the balance sheet now that you’ve gotten the investment grade rating from all three agencies. Debt-to-total gross assets reflects maybe even a little bit of an increase over the course of the year. Can you explain that?
Al Campbell: No, debt-to-gross-assets compared to prior year-end is down a couple of 100 basis points really.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: No, I mean talking about your guidance. So, I think you were 43.9%, right, as of the end of the quarter...
Al Campbell: Yeah... Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets:...and the guidance is 43% to 45%?
Al Campbell: Yeah. The guidance is to stay about where we are plus or minus a few bps. But 44% is sort of the midpoint of the guidance and that’s really our target.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay.
Al Campbell: You might see us go a little bit below that as we progress in the year, but that’s really – given our strategy, Rich, sort of a lower risk strategy and the reception that we’ve gotten from the rating agencies, we think that’s pretty much the right level.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Eric, you talked about 2014, 2015 supply risk and I think you kind of said – you kind of explained some of the strategy that you’ve put in place that mitigate some of that risk for you guys in your markets and one of them being I guess buying out products coming out of the ground and developing it yourself. But what other strategies, can you provide a little bit more color on what MAA is going to do differently this time when supply does inevitably kind of rain on the parade at least to some degree for you? And how your behaviors might change from maybe the past few cycles with other cycle?
Eric Bolton: Well, I think that for us we think that now given our markets and just given our strategy, now is not the time to ramp up a big development pipeline. I think that there’s plenty of that happening and plenty of it coming and we find that particularly in some of the secondary markets that a lot of these developers are not really building this product with the intent of holding it. We also find a lot of them are not particularly adept at leasing and lease-up and we find that while there’s a lot of handwringing in one sense from an operating perspective about, worry about supply trends, in another sense I’m looking forward to it, because I think it’s going to yield for us some terrific buying opportunities down the road and that’s why the work underway on the balance sheet is so important. And for us it’s all about just trying to find a way to create a competitive advantage for our capital and with the balance sheet and with the execution capabilities that we have as some of this product comes in the market, certain submarkets, without a doubt are going to get a little bit soft in 2014 and 2015 and we hope to be there with a checkbook in hand and create some great buying opportunities. So, I think that for us it’s all about just making sure we’re positioned for some inevitable submarket weaknesses that will pop up from here or there, and not get enamored with the idea that everybody is building and we need to build too and let’s just ramp up a big development pipeline. That’s just – that’s not the way we operate.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: So would you say that’s the biggest difference for the company, the balance sheet and your ability to participate on the buy side versus last – previous cycles? And is there anything strategic you can do besides that to mitigate some of the risks or is that basically it?
Eric Bolton: I think that’s basically it. I think that just being disciplined with how we deploy capital is the best thing you can do to mitigate risks when things weaken. And as we look to deploy capital in 2013, our expectation in the underwriting will reflect some level of rent growth moderating in 2014 and 2015, and if we can buy on a basis that has that assumption built into it, we’ll buy. If not, we won’t.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Fair enough. On your commentary, you said 9 to 1 jobs to units for large markets I think, right, and 12 to 1 for secondary, is that what the numbers were?
Eric Bolton: Correct.
Al Campbell: Correct.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: What’s the trouble down there? I assume it’s not 1 to 1, right? So I assume you got to have some number, is it 5 or 6 to 1 where you’re kind of equilibrium? Like how far above are those numbers from where if you kind of get into an equilibrium-type stage?
Eric Bolton: I’ve seen a couple of different reports or several different reports and it’s either 5 to 1 or 6 to 1 is kind of where the equilibrium. Different people go through different allocations in terms of certain number of households will choose to own versus rent and certain ones will choose to rent a home versus rent an apartment. And so, most suggests that 5 to 1, 6 to 1 you’re kind of at equilibrium.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Back to you, Al. If you were to hold everything else constant except for the fact that you now have three investment grade ratings. How much do you think the company saves if, notwithstanding the change in interest rates and all that, sort of stuff, just holding everything else stationary, is it 50 basis points, call it, 10-year money what – more than, less than that, what do you think?
Al Campbell: Well, I think we’ve already captured to the process on our credit facility 30 to 40 basis points, Rich, and that was – you need one – you need two ratings to do that. With this final rating, I think that the next step will be at full access on an efficient basis to the bond market should get you another 20 or 30 basis points I think. Now you may not see all of that the first issuance but certainly as you become a seasoned issuer that’s very realistic, I think. So that’s the goal.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And last question is on the same-store guidance of 4% to 6% NOI. How much would that be if you kind of took out the ancillary stuff in the revenue line, would it be 100 basis points less or maybe not that much. Can you just kind of...
Al Campbell: Maybe 40 to 50 basis points, Rich, somewhere in that line. It’s a contributor but certainly rents are the primary driver.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, fine. Thank you very much, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Paula Poskon – Robert Baird: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Eric Bolton: Good morning, Paula.
Paula Poskon – Robert Baird: Eric, regarding your acquisition guidance, can you just talk about what deal flow has looked like recently in particular with EQR selling so many of their assets in many of your core markets and whether or not you’ve looked at those and whether or not you think even just having that additional activity has attracted new buyers to your markets?
Eric Bolton: Well, the market is pretty active. I mean our deal flow remains very, very full. We’re looking at a lot of different opportunities at the moment. I think that whether it’s the EQR transactions, or properties or whether it’s just capital broadly being drawn to the apartment sector, there is certainly a lot of capital in all the markets than we’re seeing more activity in secondary markets as well. As it relates specifically to the EQR assets, honestly, we’ve seen a couple of them. But for the most part, it’s really not the product that we’re targeting to buy. We’ve added a little over $1 billion worth of new assets in the last four years. The average age has been four years old. The product that we’ve been seeing that EQR is putting out there was 15 and in some cases 20 years old and that’s really not what we’re targeting to add to the balance sheet.
Paula Poskon – Robert Baird: That’s very helpful. Thanks, Eric. Are you guys surprised that move-outs to home ownerships is down given all the euphoria about the housing recovery? And I guess, relatedly, how is that metric varying across your markets?
Tom Grimes: Paula, it’s Tom. I think surprised not so much in fourth quarter because it’s been sort of the story all year down to flat, flat to down, down to flat. It’s not materially down to be honest with you, but it’s at an all time low. I think this time last year, I would have thought it would have picked up a little bit, but it’s not that surprising to be honest with you. As far as how it varies by market, we see a higher percentage in the large markets moving out to homebuyers and a lower percentage in the secondary markets.
Paula Poskon – Robert Baird: Interesting. And finally, are you seeing any competition from the single-family rental product that’s also been so much in the news in recent months?
Tom Grimes: Just none. And we’re really glad we’re not doing it because it seems like a very, very hard business to make money doing on an ongoing operating basis. But I mean there’s just not been that move-outs, renting homes has stayed between 5% and 6% for the last two years. I would think now is the best time it’s ever going to be to rent a home and it doesn’t seem to move the needle and certainly not with the folks that we’re renting to. My sort of sense is that home renter is most likely going to be an ex-homeowner and that people just want to be in a house aren’t coming back to us, they’re going to that pool.
Paula Poskon – Robert Baird: Thanks very much. That’s all I have today.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Paula.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Good morning, guys.
Eric Bolton: Hi, Mike.
Al Campbell: Hi.
Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Al, just to go back to the debt offering situation. I know you guys – you don’t have a lot of debt maturing but you do have a bunch of swap maturities maturing. Is kind of the plan as those maturities come due to then do the unsecured offering and kind of time that so there’s no significant benefit. I think you threw out a number of treasuries plus 200 basis points would probably put you right around 4% there versus the 5.2% maturities. Just kind of wondering what you’ve got kind of embedded in terms of interest rate savings on that.
Al Campbell: You’re right on top it, Mike. That’s a very good number you put together. And you’re exactly right, we are knocking down 2014 maturities and we’re going to do that after the swaps mature. Now, since you do a bond transaction in one big deal, we’re going to let the $100 million to $150 million of those swaps mature before. That’s why we say we’ll be in the bond market in the latter part, call it, late second, third quarter time range and let majority of those swaps mature so that we can match that very well. But you’re on top of that, it’s to replace those costs and around 4% is what we have. That’s a good estimate to dial in right now.
Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. So pick the interest expense savings that you’ve dialed into the numbers is pretty minimal, the way its set up there?
Al Campbell: It is. It is. It is. And obviously because we’re also moving fixed rate debt up as a percentage, so that we’re taking it closer to 93%, 94% fixed at the end of the year versus we’ve average more or like 90% fixed or hedged this year. So that has impact on as well, Mike.
Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. I appreciate that. Eric, you talked about the disposition strategy not wanting to change your exposure between primary and secondary markets. But can you talk a little bit about your exposure between secondary and kind of tertiary markets? Do you expect to change that around a bit over the next couple years?
Eric Bolton: Well, it’s a good question, Mike. And yes, we do. What we’re really driven by, as I mentioned, is a desire to continue to harvest value out of the lower margin investments and reinvest in a higher margin investments. What that generally translates to is selling older properties and buying newer properties. As it so happens, a lot of our older assets are in the more tertiary markets that we have. And so as a consequence of that, you will see the tertiary market component of that secondary market segment begin to shrink. And as it relates to – and you look at the dispositions we have planned for this year of the markets like Brunswick, Georgia, Valdosta, Thomasville, Melbourne, Florida, Athens, and Lagrange, Georgia. Those are all targeted dispositions this year. And we believe that in our goal is honestly just to be sure that we’re getting this capital recycled into investments that we think over the next 10 years will produce higher margins. And to the extent that we’re able to cycle out of some of those markets, those names I just mentioned and go into some other secondary market such as Kansas City, such as Charleston, such as Savannah, the hope is that that creates maybe a little bit more comfort with the secondary market segment of our portfolio and we hope the market appreciates that change.
Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: And, Tom, not to leave you out. I think you said 40 to 60 basis points embedded in the outlook for 2013 related to ancillary income. What’s kind of the forecast in terms of market rent growth you guys are kind of thinking about for 2013 dialing in? And also not sure if you have this number, but what’s kind of like the loss to lease are, embedded like where market is versus kind of where the portfolio is today?
Tom Grimes: It will be just sort of a continuation of what we’ve got, it will be on market rents between 4% and 4.5% and in terms of what average effective will be throughout the year. And then ask that question again about loss to lease – where we are loss to lease or is that sort of what’s baked in?
Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Yeah, kind of what’s – kind of where does – what are portfolio rents like how much have you captured kind of what’s the earning in 2013 versus how much do you expect in terms of market? I’m just trying to walk through the dynamics of that.
Tom Grimes: Yeah. I mean a lot of it is based on the good work that was done this year on moving renewals and new rents out. So I think it’s a blended effort between new rents and renewals and that it’s – we’re probably 30% of the way done, something like that.
Mike Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you much.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Buck Horne – Raymond James: Hey, thanks. Good morning, gentlemen.
Eric Bolton: Hi, Buck.
Buck Horne – Raymond James: Eric, if the market for older value add assets is still frothy right now, why not accelerate the capital recycling efforts a little bit more aggressively and really try to lower the average age of the portfolio into this market right now?
Eric Bolton: Well, we are selling more than we’ve ever sold. We sold more last year than we’ve ever sold in a given year and we’ll sell more this year. I think that to some degree it’s a function of also being able to redeploy those proceeds. We’re mindful of how much earnings dilution we’re willing to take in a given calendar year to complete this recycling effort. I would say that, we’re pretty comfortable executing at this level. Having said that, I mean, obviously, if we see an opportunity to sell two or three more assets than what we had contemplated, we certainly won’t hesitate to pull the trigger on that. But broadly speaking, we think that the volume that we’re contemplating is about right given our ability to reinvest the proceeds. As I mentioned earlier, we’re not under any sort of pressure. I don’t feel – we’re not trying to strategically change anything about our portfolio. We’re not trying to do anything fundamentally different. It’s really just a steady diet of continuing to recycle – harvest value, recycle into higher margin investments and we expect to be at this level for quite some time.
Buck Horne – Raymond James: Okay. Also thinking about your markets right now, there is a couple that kind of pop out of me, I’m just kind of curious about specifically Jacksonville, Nashville, and maybe Raleigh is places where it seems like a lot of new housing supply has started to ramp up in those areas, but maybe the job growth and/or the income growth in those markets hasn’t quite met what some economists might have thought would have occurred in those markets. And I’m wondering what your thoughts are. I know you’re expanding into Jacksonville and that maybe a kind of a bit of a unique opportunity. But what are your thoughts about those types of markets? And then separately from that, what are your thoughts about Texas and what your maximum exposure to Texas ought to be?
Tom Grimes: All right. I’ll jump in, Buck, this is Tom on the market stuff and I’ll let Eric cover the exposure to Texas. I’ll be glad to talk about what we see happening there. But just – I think you said Raleigh, Jacks, Nashville and was there a fourth?
Buck Horne – Raymond James: No, just those three would be – just at a high level, talk about those areas?
Tom Grimes: Sure. No, I think Raleigh is pretty encouraging on the job growth front, but it has some new construction coming into the market they were watching carefully. It tends to – it’s spread out a bit. It’s a little bit of exposure in our Brier Creek submarket, not so much in our Cary properties and virtually nothing that competes with the Hue, Downtown. So, we’re optimistic on that one. It’s been good for us. We think it’ll continue to put out good growth but not over-the-top growth. And Jacksonville is one where that opportunity is unique and we can go into that further if you want to, but it’s just, as Eric described in the call comments, sort of a super opportunity. But right now, Jacksonville is chugging along at 5% on a revenue growth rate, growth of 37 and occupancy at 96. And I think you’ll see out of markets like Jacksonville and Raleigh just kind of continued steady good growth. It is not going to compare to – it’s certainly not early in the year to Austin, Dallas, Houston, those kind of places. So I would expect it just to continue to do well. Nashville, we’re expecting to be strong again. It’s jobs to completions ratios, 8:1 and we’re pretty optimistic about what Nashville can do next year.
Buck Horne – Raymond James: Okay, great. Texas, real quick, it’s obviously very strong. What do you think maximum exposure in Mid-America’s portfolio ought to be to Texas?
Eric Bolton: Well, I think that, I mean, as far as Dallas and Houston are concerned from a broad portfolio allocation perspective, we’re pretty much there. We started recycle some money out of Dallas little bit last year and the year before and Houston, somewhat similar. I would tell you that we’re looking at more opportunity in Austin and looking at a little bit more opportunity in San Antonio, two markets where our exposure from a portfolio perspective is not too great at this point. I wouldn’t see Texas broadly as a market that gets a lot more growth in our portfolio, but as you know it’s a pretty strong economy there and we like the long-term dynamics. We just have to be mindful of the supply issue from time-to-time.
Buck Horne – Raymond James: Thanks, guys.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Buck.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Tayo Okusanya – Jefferies: Yes. Good morning. Congrats ongoing three-for-three with the rating agencies. Most of my questions have been answered, but just a quick one. The increase in recurring CapEx, that’s in the numbers 2013 versus 2012, could you talk a little bit about that and what’s driving that?
Al Campbell: I think the important thing to note – Tayo, this is Al, good morning. I think the important thing to note about that is over the long-term there is a increase from the prior year, I think it’s by 6% – $0.06 to $0.07 somewhere in that range. But I think if you look over the last five years, CapEx has grown probably 2.5% on average for the five-year period. So, the recurring capital tends to be a little bit volatile depending on the project you have going on. Paint jobs, roofing are pretty significant projects and can be pushed forward or backward here or there and so that has a little bit of impact long-term 2.5% growth. We think the current spending level is a good level and over the long-term the inflationary growth is about right.
Tayo Okusanya – Jefferies: Got it. Okay, that’s helpful. And then also could you talk a little bit just about what you’re seeing from a tax perspective, as well as increases on property taxes?
Al Campbell: I can. Interesting thing, you’ve seen, you’ve followed us, we went into this year thinking taxes would grow 4% to 5% having 4.5%. We ended up seeing about 3% this year. The main pressure as we expected were Texas, Florida and Georgia. We expected both value increases and millage rate increases in those three key areas and we saw all of that in Texas. I mean, they are definitely aggressive on their program. Florida and Georgia what we saw was the values began to come up, but we didn’t really see the rise in millage rates that we had and thought might happen. That’s a little bit more of a political situation, a lot of things involved in that. So that was part of that favorability coming in the fourth quarter. Going into 2013, we do expect at least in the short term some continued pressure in this area and in those key markets, Texas, Florida, Georgia, and add Tennessee in there for 2013 at least because it’s on a revaluation cycle and 2013 is a revaluation year. So, all those things are part of that growth. I think important again to take a long term perspective on taxes just like I mentioned capital, if you take our projected 6% midpoint growth in taxes for 2013, and you add that in to the last six years, you’re going to get less than a 2% growth in taxes over the last six years. And so, again, important to note, though we’re seeing pressure now and maybe some in 2014 over long term more modest growth, the states and municipalities are really getting back a little bit of the declines that they gave up back in 2009 and 2010.
Tayo Okusanya – Jefferies: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carol Kemple of Hilliard Lyons. Your line is open.
Carol Kemple – Hilliard Lyons: Good morning.
Eric Bolton: Good morning.
Carol Kemple – Hilliard Lyons: Earlier in the call, you all mentioned buying a couple of properties from the JV. At this point, do you think you’ll look to buy the JV out or why these two properties in particular?
Eric Bolton: Well, this is the Fund I JV that we had with Fannie Mae and we just approached them, and began conversations some months ago and just decided that – that’s a JV that we capped. It’s not active in the market looking to add any assets. They were interested in just cleaning that up and so we’re just going to buy them out of those two properties. Our other JV, Fund II that we have, it’s an active JV. It’s one that’s targeting the value-add reposition in place. It’s still – our partner is still very much interested in finding ways to deploy capital as we are, but as I mentioned, it’s just the pricing for those value-add opportunities is very, very competitive and we just didn’t feel comfortable forecasting any acquisition activity in that this year. But the assets that we co-own with them at this point, they’re comfortable continuing to own as we are and so that one is still active.
Carol Kemple – Hilliard Lyons: Okay. And then do you know with the properties that you all targeted for disposition this year, what their average effective rent rate would be on a monthly basis?
Al Campbell: No. I can’t tell you specifically for that portfolio. I can tell you this, Carol, this is Al. If you take the property that we’ve sold over the last few years, you’re talking about a difference in dispositions, the average is less than $700, call it $650 to $700, and then the ones we’re acquiring are more like $1,000, $1,100 on average per unit. So there is a pretty big difference there.
Eric Bolton: And that would hold true for this group as well.
Al Campbell: Yes.
Carol Kemple – Hilliard Lyons: Okay. So the $650 to $700 would probably be true?
Al Campbell: I would expect that, yes.
Carol Kemple – Hilliard Lyons: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question is a follow-up from Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Sorry for keeping you around. Just a small one. Al, what you have dialed in to G&A for acquisition related expenses?
Al Campbell: What we do, Rich, is very simple. We take 75 to 80 basis points of the acquisition volumes, so you can take $250, $300 what you dial-in times call it 80 basis points, and that would be what we’d use. That’s over long term what we’re seeing to be the average of that cost.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Is that – just out of curiosity, has there been a way to manage those costs now that they’ve been expensed in the FFO calculation or is there no real way to kind of lower that exposure?
Al Campbell: You’re talking about primarily like commissions and legal costs. I mean if you buy a bigger deal, it’s a little more efficient because of the leap on all the activities, but other than that, it’s really tough to manage that much more than that. It used to be – I’ll give you this, it has come down, it used to be closer to 100 basis points.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Right. That’s what I mean, yeah.
Al Campbell: 75 to 80 basis points because of the size of deals and we are working on...
Eric Bolton: I think the size of the deal has been – frankly, several years ago, some of the deals that we’re buying were – had legal issues or financing issues and some of the legal issues were just a little bit more challenging. Frankly, going forward, what we’re seeing is things are a little cleaner and not nearly the level of distress and so, it may come down a little bit.
Rich Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions. If you’d like to – any closing remarks?
Eric Bolton: No closing remarks. Thanks, everyone, for joining us and we will be – you know where to get a hold of us if you need. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect at this time. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-11-02 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating in the MAA Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. The company will first share its prepared comments, followed by a question-and-answer session. At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin. 
Leslie Bratten Cantrell Wolfgang: Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations for MAA. With me this morning are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO.
 Before we begin with our prepared comments, I do want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Eric. 
H. Bolton: Thanks, Leslie, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. 
 Third quarter performance exceeded the midpoint of our guidance, with favorable leasing conditions that continue to support high occupancy and strong rent growth. Resident turnover remains low, with third quarter move-outs increasing only 0.7% as compared to the third quarter of last year. Rent growth trends also remained steady, with same-store effective rent growth of 5.2% in the third quarter, which is consistent with the 5.2% performance captured in the second quarter. We're currently under way with property level budgeting and forecasting for next year and expect that favorable leasing conditions will continue in 2013. From what we see at our properties, a continued recovery next year in the single-family housing market is unlikely to have a meaningfully negative impact on leasing conditions across our portfolio. 
 Turnover associated with move-outs to single-family home buying drove only 18% of our turnover in the third quarter, which is consistent with the performance in the preceding second quarter. Likewise, turnover associated with move-outs to rent a single-family home only contributed to 6% of our move-outs in the third quarter, which is again consistent with the preceding second quarter. 
 While it's reasonable to believe that a more robust recovery in the employment markets and economy could eventually drive more demand for single-family housing, these same factors will also support increasing demand for apartment housing as well. New apartment supply projections across our portfolio continue to look manageable when compared to the outlook for job growth and growing demand. Within our Large Markets segment of the portfolio, latest projections suggest a ratio of just over 8 jobs to each new unit expected to be delivered next year, which is stronger than the last upcycle we had over the 2004 to 2007 time frame. 
 Within our Secondary Markets segment, the story is even better, with the job growth to new supply ratio projected to be just over 10:1 in 2013. 
 In our large markets, you really have to get into submarket analysis to understand what threat, if any, emerging new supply is likely to have at specific locations. It's worth noting that in a number of the larger markets, new supply is more likely to create pressure on locations in more of the urban or core CBD submarkets and less likely to materially impact most of our locations. Within the secondary markets, in general, we just don't see much new permitting activity taking place, and would expect that this segment of our portfolio is more likely to capture improving performance as compared to our Large Markets segment towards the second half of next year. 
 As noted in our earnings release, we had an active quarter for property transactions, selling 5 properties and acquiring 4. Over the past 3 years, we've added a total of $1.1 billion in new properties, with an average age of 3 years. And as a result, we believe we have materially strengthened our long-term earnings outlook. Construction activities and lease-up continues on our core development properties, and we look forward to more meaningful earnings contribution from this pipeline in 2013 and '14. You'll note in our earnings release that we recently closed on a land parcel near downtown Jacksonville and expect to be under way with development of 294 units at this site before year end. 
 We expect to continue with an active capital recycling program next year as we steadily redeploy capital into higher-margin investments. Our strategy remains centered on value creation, primarily through the acquisition process, and we expect that our markets, the extensive relationships we have across the region and our established transaction execution capabilities will continue to yield attractive new investment opportunities next year. 
 So in summary, we expect to capture record FFO per share results in 2012, outpacing last year's record result, and expect 2013 will likewise be another record year performance for MAA. 
 That's all I've got. Al? 
Albert M. Campbell: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide a few comments on earnings performance for the third quarter, as well as a few highlights on investing and financing activities. 
 FFO for the third quarter was $48.2 million or $1.11 per share, which is $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our prior guidance. Better-than-expected performance from both our same-store portfolio and development in lease-up communities produced the majority of this favorable performance for the quarter. 
 Revenue performance was essentially in line with expectations, driven by the 5.2% growth in average effective rents over the prior year, reflecting a continued pricing momentum in virtually all of our markets. Operating expenses for the same-store portfolio were better than expectations, with lower-than-projected repair and maintenance, utilities and real estate tax expenses combining to produce about $0.01 per share of favorable results. The remaining $0.01 per share for the quarter was primarily produced by our development pipeline, as lease-up for the 2 communities with delivered units continuing to outperform expectations. 
 As Eric mentioned, we were very active in property transactions during the quarter. We invested $218 million in the 4 new communities acquired, which brings our year-to-date acquisition volume to $345 million. Initial cap rates for these acquisitions averaged around 5.6% on first year's projected cash flows, after deducting a 4% management fee and a $350 per unit CapEx reserve, which is expected to grow to about 5.8% on completion of the significant upgrade projects at several of these communities. 
 As part of the annual recycling plan, we also sold 5 communities during the quarter, for total proceeds of $47.3 million, producing a $16.1 million gain on dispositions recorded during the quarter. These sales bring our year-to-date disposition volume to about $100 million, and we have one additional community under contract to sell during the fourth quarter. And after completing this final sale, full year disposition volume is expected to be about $113 million for the non-communities averaging 25 years of age. The overall cap rate for these dispositions is expected to be about 6.8% based on the final in-place cash flows after deducting a 4% management fee and a $350 per unit CapEx reserve. 
 Construction and lease-up continues to progress very well in the 4 communities under development. During the third quarter, we funded an additional $12 million toward completion of these projects, bringing the total investment to nearly $109 million or about 75% of the expected total cost of these projects. At quarter end, Ridge at Chenal Valley in Little Rock was fully delivered, while Cool Springs in Nashville was 75% delivered. Nearly 2/3 of the delivered units were already leased by the end of the quarter. 
 Cool Springs is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter, while 1225 South Church in Charlotte is excepted to be completed in the first quarter of 2013, followed by River's Walk in Charleston to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2013. As mentioned in the release, we plan to begin construction of one additional development community located in Jacksonville during the fourth quarter, which we expect to be completed mid-2014. 
 Our balance sheet ended the quarter in great position, and we continue to make progress to our rating goal. And as previously mentioned, during July, we received the first time investment grade rating from Moody's of Baa2, which is the second level of investment grade, which immediately reduced the cost of our outstanding borrowings under both our unsecured credit facility and term loan by 30 to 40 basis points. During the quarter, we also expanded our unsecured credit facility to $325 million and issued $175 million in secured -- in senior unsecured notes to pay down additional secured borrowings and to fund the acquisition and development activity. We also issued 813,000 common shares during the quarter at an average price just over $67 per share, for a total net proceeds of $53.7 million, which was also used to fund acquisition and development activity. 
 During the quarter, we repaid an additional $43 million of secured debt, releasing the related mortgages, which along with our acquisition activity, increased our unencumbered asset pool to 51% of gross assets at the end of the third quarter, as compared to only 24% 1 year ago. At the end of the third quarter, our total debt, net of cash balances, was 44.7% of gross assets and just below 7x EBITDA. While our fixed charge coverage ratio for the third quarter was 4.3x, well above the rating agency thresholds. And also at the end of the quarter, 90% of our outstanding debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates, resulting in total effective rate of 3.7% for the quarter. 
 We believe these metrics put us in a very good position to pursue an additional credit rating from S&P, with the goal of achieving a full investment grade position later this year or early next year. 
 And finally, given the third quarter performance and updated expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our FFO guidance for the full year by $0.04 per share at the midpoint, $0.02 of which relates to the third quarter performance, with the remaining $0.02 relating to the revised expectations for our same-store and non-same-store portfolios over the remainder of the year. Our updated FFO guidance for the year is now a range of $4.46 to $4.56 per share, $4.51 at the midpoint, which is a 13% increase over the prior year. And the key assumptions included in our forecast are wholly-owned acquisition volume of $345 million to $400 million, a $50 million increase to the top end of our guidance range; disposition volume of about $113 million, only depending on one additional community under contract; and development funding of $80 million to $85 million for the year. We also expect our leverage to fund these net debt-to-gross assets to end the year in the 44% to 46% range, with about 90% of our debt fixed or hedged, with an average interest cost between 3.7% and 3.8% for the full year. 
 That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Howard, I'll turn the call over to you for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald. 
David Toti: I just have a couple of sort of detail questions for you today. The expense diversions between the large and secondary markets was a little bit noticeable. Do you think there's a specific driver to that in the quarter? 
Albert M. Campbell: The big driver of that -- I'll let Tom tell you some of the details, but the big driver of that was real estate tax. We had some credits during the third quarter, and so they impacted one segment more than they did another, and that was the main driver. Typically, you get a lot of information in the third quarter and that's pretty common that, that can happen. 
Thomas L. Grimes: And then on the -- David, on the operating level, we had a little bit higher turn level in the secondary markets in the late second quarter. And we're actually able to wring a little efficiency on the cost per turn in the third quarter on that. So we were able to spread our turn cost out a little bit and be more efficient there. 
David Toti: That actually leads into my next question, which was the turn is lower in the large markets, which is sort of counterintuitive. Is there any sort of dynamic that you think is happening to drive that? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Absolutely. Here in the small markets, we had again and sort of late second, early third quarter, we had some onetime exposure to military deployments, carrier deployments in Virginia and the 3rd Infantry Brigade in Columbus, Georgia, and that generated a little bit higher turn. That creates kind of a onetime market lull, and then it sort of snaps back out. So it's not a market fundamental shift in the secondary. It's really just sort of onetime move-out, and then it picks right back up. 
H. Bolton: October occupancy in the secondary markets was back ahead of last year, so it was just a onetime event. 
David Toti: Okay. That's helpful. And then my last question it just has to do with you sort of boosted guidance a little bit, but the underlying assumptions didn't move that much. Are you still pretty comfortable with the 4.5% to 5.5% range revenue growth for the full year? 
Albert M. Campbell: We are comfortable with that. I think if you average out the first 3 quarters, you'll come somewhere to low -- below the midpoint of that range. I will say that given what we expect for occupancy, continued pricing performance and solid occupancy performance for the fourth quarter, we expect the revenue performance in the fourth quarter to be ahead of the average that we have so far, improving out a bit. 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, the secondary markets have been finding a little bit of an occupancy comparison headwind. That ends with the third quarter, and we're more optimistic. And well, it ends -- that headwind ends in the third and we're pretty optimistic about the fourth. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rob Stevenson from Macquarie. 
Robert Stevenson: Al, given your comments there, where -- as you head into fourth quarter here and into next year, where is your most significant expense pressures besides real estate taxes? 
Albert M. Campbell: Taxes are certainly one. As we went into the year, I think that the context is we expect the taxes to be 4% to 5%. And so that was certainly the most significant pressure going into the year. I think in overall context, it's still -- it's the same message. Taxes now are 3.5% sort of 3% or 4% for the year expectations because we have better information now. That is the primary pressure that we expect. I think repair maintenance and utilities during the third quarter gave us some positive performance, and we're feeling very good about that. But I think in the fourth quarter, you will see some unfavorable comparisons on real estate taxes. For the full year, it's still going to be 3.5%, Rob, but we had a lot of information coming in, in the fourth quarter of last year, driving some credits last year. So for that one line item, you're going to see, though, good for the year and better for the year now, it's going to be unfavorable for the fourth quarter, so I would expect that. 
Robert Stevenson: So nothing else that should be sticking out besides taxes? 
H. Bolton: No. 
Albert M. Campbell: Not really. At this point, no, we don't expect anything else. 
Robert Stevenson: And what's the rough magnitude of the breakdown on your expense side between, Al, real estate taxes as a percent and then just other sort of major groups? 
Albert M. Campbell: I think real estate taxes and personnel costs are by far the largest and well over half. So those are the key drivers. And utilities are another big, big area. So and keep in mind that we do bill back the majority of our utilities back to our customers. But those 3 are really the drivers, the biggest dollars in that lineup. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then I guess a question for you, Eric. I mean what's your thought here? I mean you've sold some assets, you've issued some stock, but where are you thinking to fund future acquisition and developments in terms of asset sales there, especially given where the implied cap rate is on the stock today? Does selling more aggressively, especially some of the older assets, to bring the average age down on the portfolio or continue to bring the average age down the portfolio make more sense in today's market? 
H. Bolton: We will definitely be selling more next year than we sold this year. We have a plan to really step up the recycling effort over the next 2 to 3 years. And as long as conditions support it, we plan to see that pace pick up a little bit. I would put order of magnitude somewhere around $150 million, maybe $160 million or so next year. But we really will see over the next couple of years more of a sort of a balanced funding plan, where we will be recycling into higher-margin investments, as well as on a net basis, we'll probably still be, we believe, a net acquirer and that will require the need to go back to the market at some level. But we think that the disposition of the recycling effort will become a greater component of our funding plans and needs over the next couple of years. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then what's been the recent conversations with the board on the dividend? 
H. Bolton: We will have that conversation with the board as we always do in early December. We -- in early December, every year, sit down with our board and update our 3-year business strategy. And as part of that process, discuss dividend payout. And so we will do that in the first week of December. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then just lastly, you guys entered K.C. this quarter. I mean what other markets out there or are there other substantial markets that interest you at this point and where you're seeing decent deal flow where you could enter with buying a couple of assets? 
H. Bolton: No other real target market that I can point to right now. We continue to like the footprint. We continue to be very committed to the idea of bifurcating capital between large and secondary markets roughly in the same weighting we have today. As a consequence of our stepped-up efforts of recycling capital out of some lower margin, older investments into higher margin, newer investments as a focus of that, it just so happens that a lot of our older properties are in some of our secondary or more tertiary markets. And so, you'll be seeing much more active recycling taking place in that particular component of the portfolio. And so markets like Kansas City and San Antonio and Charleston and Savannah, those are some of the secondary markets that we would like to continue to fill out in. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay. I mean and I guess just to add to that, I mean is there any inclination on your part to partner with some merchant developers in some of those areas? If you can't find enough product to buy in the secondary markets as a whole to keep your sort of weighing between the secondary and primary markets sort of relatively consistent? Or with that, would we likely to see some of the secondary markets NOI sort of tailing down and the primary markets becoming an increasing portion of the NOI or the company? 
H. Bolton: No, I think that, clearly, we do have a lot of conversations always going on with developers in some of these secondary markets. And that's why you see us deploying capital in development in markets like Little Rock and Charleston and Jacksonville. You're not going to see us do development in Dallas and Atlanta. We let others do that. But, yes, in an effort to kind of keep our portfolio strategy intact and continue to execute on this recycling effort, to the extent that we deploy capital with development, it will be a secondary market focus. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets. 
Richard Anderson: So I just want to get back to the fourth quarter guidance or the fourth quarter revenue number. It implies you going from 4.2% revenue growth to 6.7% revenue growth? Is that right? 
Albert M. Campbell: No, that wouldn't be the math I would -- what I would say is the first 3 quarters gets you somewhere around the lower end of the range. We expect the fourth quarter to be a strong quarter, so I would expect the full year to be below the midpoint of the range, maybe closer to the bottom of the range, but still be -- but the performance of fourth quarter is stronger than the third quarter. And probably with the first 3 quarters -- first 2 quarters, yes. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. So if your revenue range for the year is 4.5% to 5.5% and you're running at below 4.5%, you're saying you get -- by getting -- am I doing that right? I mean... 
Albert M. Campbell: The first 3, you average out to close to 4.5% and if you finish strong in the fourth quarter, you'll end up somewhere around, call it, 4.75% to something like 4% or 4.6% to 4.8% range, Rich, and that's sort of the thinking. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. So you don't think you'll -- maybe I'll take it offline because it seems like you need to do more than that. And you're also saying the top end of the range, so are you saying the NOI number is more... 
Albert M. Campbell: NOI is top end of the range. 
Richard Anderson: Right. Is more of an expense-driven phenomenon? 
Albert M. Campbell: Yes. That's what we've talked about. And we really -- we talked about that a little bit in the second quarter, begin saying that our range in expenses -- we didn't change our range in the second quarter -- but we said we'll be toward the bottom end. We had a little more favorable performance in expenses in the third quarter, and so we felt the need to move the range. And so revenues will end up in the range below the midpoint for sure but have strong performance in the fourth quarter, stronger than the first 3. That's the expectation. 
Richard Anderson: So speaking on external growth, I know you're primarily an acquisition story, but it appears you are at least contemplating to doing more development in the future. And you say that, at the same time, you're saying you'll step up recycling, and using dispositions more as a funding element to your story. So I don't know, it seems like 2 different directions you're going in terms of taking on risk? And can you just talk a little bit about your development mindset? I probably asked this question here every quarter, but your development mindset as it relates to where you think you are in this game. Are we in the sixth inning, seventh inning? Just talk to me about that. 
H. Bolton: Well, we think that development will remain a limited part of our external growth story. I mean kind of order of magnitude, we think that external growth on sort of a steady state basis via acquisitions will probably be somewhere between $300 million to $400 million a year. Our development pipeline, we're kind of comfortable carrying up to about $150 million at any one point in time. We've got 4 projects, currently 2 are nearing lease-up, stabilized status. The other 2 will be delivered next year, 1 in January of next year. So we think that we're at a point that we can reload that pipeline, and thus we did the deal in Jacksonville that we just alluded to. I do not believe that, that for a host of reasons that us being a big developer is the right thing to do. And our platform, our approach to development, as we're doing again in Jacksonville, is essentially to enter into a negotiated fixed price contract with the developer. We handle the lease-up, they build it for us. They are free to walk away, we own it. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. It makes sense. Last question, do you -- I'm asking everyone, do you know if Astec owns any of your stock? 
H. Bolton: We are unaware of that at this time. 
Richard Anderson: Actually, more to the point, though, what do you think about M&A? I mean you guys obviously are a great organization. I'm not suggesting -- I hate to see you go, but I mean do you think the endgame for the sector will be some consolidation, public-to-public consolidation? Not maybe commenting on your situation specifically, but just as a general thought about M&A in the space? 
H. Bolton: I don't think that there's any sort of macro trends or macro needs afoot that would suggest that we're going to see a flurry of M&A start to take place. I think when it takes place, what M&A that does occur, is typically company-specific issue that has arisen, either it's -- for a host of reasons, somebody just decides that staying independent or staying in the public market doesn't make any sense. And so I don't think that there's any -- I don't see any huge initiative under way to have it or need, frankly, for the sector to shrink down to half the number of companies it is today, as an example. I just think it's a case-by-case situation, and companies decide what they want to do. 
Richard Anderson: And for you guys, you feel pretty good about just continuing to do your thing? But if you ever got the right price, you would have a conversation because that's your fiduciary responsibility? Is that the right way to think about it? 
H. Bolton: I mean, certainly, we understand what our fiduciary responsibilities are. And I mean, we're always going to do the right thing for shareholders. Having said that, we're very comfortable doing what we're doing. We felt like that we've demonstrated the ability to create great value for shareholders over a long period of time. We feel like we're fulfilling a particular niche in this sector that I think the market appreciates in various points in the cycle, more times or more so than others at various points in the cycle, but we're comfortable doing what we're doing. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. 
Michael Salinsky: First question, probably for Tom. Can you talk about new lease and renewal growth in October, as well as on how that compares to the third quarter? And also, where you kind of sit portfolio-wide from an occupancy standpoint at the end of October? Just trying to get comfortable with the revenue guidance you guys talked about there. 
H. Bolton: Yes, sure, sure. And I'll just bang through on third quarter and October numbers here. Starting with new lease, 2.8%; October, 2.4% -- or excuse me, 2.8%; for our third quarter, 2.4%; for October renewals, 6.1% and 4.7%; for blended, at 4.3% and 3.4%; and then occupancy is running ahead of October by about 20 basis points or so, where it has been running about on an average basis about 40 basis points behind. And so, we feel pretty darn strong. We also have, another forward-looking metric would be exposure. This time last year, we had exposure of 9.3, which is our 60-day uncovered, and we're at 8.3 this go around. Traffic for October was outstanding, turnover was down. So we feel pretty good going forward. 
Michael Salinsky: Okay, that's actually very helpful. A couple bigger picture questions. First one, can you define what you mean by favorable for '13? Not asking for guidance, but just I want to get your thoughts on '13 at this point, given where we are in the cycle? 
H. Bolton: Well, I think that we're going to continue to be in a position to see steady rent growth. I mean the metrics that -- I know that there's hand-wringing over 2 issues: over this resurgence or recovery in the single-family market; and then, obviously, the conversation about new supply. We continue to believe that the threat surrounding single-family is overblown. As I've noted in my earlier comments, in the third quarter, we did not see any increasing pressure associated with single-family, either rental or for purchase, and just continue to believe that the dynamics surrounding single-family home buying are unlikely to create any pressure for us, meaningful pressure, this next year. On the supply side, I mean clearly, supply is picking up. But again, when you look I mean the way we have to try to get comfortable with supply is compare it to forecasted demand or forecasted job growth. And supply in and of itself is not a problem. It's only a problem if there's not enough demand to absorb it. And when we look at the ratio of job -- new job projections to supply in our large markets next year, it's better than it was in the last upcycle. And in the secondary markets, it's outstanding. It's only 10:1 next year. Our 10:1, which is very strong. So we continue to not to see anything out there that would suggest any material weakening in 2013 performance, as compared to 2012. The comparisons, the prior year comparisons, year-over-year comparisons, are a little more difficult just as a consequence of continuing to compare against these growth numbers that we're putting up every year. But and then when you look at the other metric that people look at in terms of ratio, rent to income, we're still right around 17%, which is well below the peak we were back several years ago at 20%. So there's just a lot of reasons for us to suggest that there doesn't appear to be looming significant headwinds going into next year. 
Michael Salinsky: That's very helpful. Then a final question, if you look at a couple of the recent Atlanta purchases as well as the Kansas City purchase, they tend to be more kind of urban mid-rise type of product, and you also made a comment about moving to kind of higher margins. Should we -- is that any change in strategy there on the investment side? Or is it more opportunistic than what you've traditionally done? 
H. Bolton: It's really more opportunistic, Mike, I think because I mean we're committed to the idea of bifurcating cap between the large and the secondary markets. Now within those markets, whether it's an urban, more downtown-oriented location or suburban location, we're sort of indifferent on that. There, once we get into the market, we're looking for good submarkets where people want to live that where we can find properties that we feel like we can acquire on a very favorable basis. And a lot of these southeastern markets, a lot of the favorable places for people to live, a lot of where the employment centers are, are out in the suburbs. Likewise, there's some great places near downtown and downtown. So we kind of -- and we think that there's some probably good things about being diversified, both suburban and urban. As opposed to concentrating on one particular end market. 
Thomas L. Grimes: And, Mike, the last -- the couple of purchases, just to remind the core stuff or the urban stuff is getting some press. But Lake Nona is suburban outside of Orlando and a great medical district, and Bronco and San Antonio, both good old bread-and-butter mid-America good suburban garden stuff. So we're buying a little of both now, which is probably the difference, not an abandonment of our suburban roots. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Dave Bragg from Zelman & Associates. 
David Bragg: Could you just quickly take us from the 5.2% increase in average effective rents to the 4.2% revenue growth in the quarter? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, I got it. And, Dave, I mean it's essentially, it's 2 main drivers. First, our average effective occupancy or average what you would call our physical occupancy was off 40 basis points from prior year. That's driven by a 70-basis-point gap in the secondary markets, which I think I touched on a little bit earlier. But just in case folks missed it, but it was really driven by some turnover related to military deployments in some of the secondary markets. The second component of that is we had great savings in utility rates, this go around. We were excited about that. The downside of that is, though, that our utility recovery fees or our reimbursement revenues were down, that's another 40 basis points of it. We're very happy with that happening because our recovery is probably -- rate is about 80%. We'd rather see it on the savings. Those are the 2 big drivers. 
Albert M. Campbell: I'll just add to that, Dave. There's been some questions about the guidance and so -- in the fourth quarter, just want to make it clear, what we're seeing is that we're expecting continued strong pricing performance of average brands. We saw 5.2% in the last 2 quarters consistent -- continuation of that, on top of the stable occupancy and minimal impact from utilities and those things that Tom just talked about. So what we expect is the top pricing rent to drop to the bottom of the revenue line in the fourth quarter. 
Thomas L. Grimes: Occupancy should be more neutral than negative for us. 
Albert M. Campbell: Yes. 
David Bragg: That's very helpful. That gets us there on the fourth quarter. And then the other question just as it relates to revenue growth and guidance, when you think back about your prior outlook or your initial outlook of 4.5% to 5.5%, that top half of the range, which is less likely now, what didn't play out? Was it performance in secondary versus large markets? Or was it rent games on either renewals or new move-ins or the utility reimbursement or occupancy. Can you just talk about the drivers of the -- where you're trending now versus the thought that you had earlier? 
Albert M. Campbell: I'll give you, I think it was a little bit of each of those line items, Dave. I think it was a little bit of pricing not quite as sharp as we thought, but a lot more coming from probably occupancy. Average occupancy for the year has been a little lower than we had projected going in and then some impact from the utilities and other things. And remember that utilities and those things are reimbursements in revenue from the expenses that we got benefit from in the bottom line. So I would say, it's really no single area. It's spread across small impacts in several of those areas. 
H. Bolton: But worth noting, I mean the midpoint of that revenue range was 5%. We think we'll probably come in for the year at 4.7% or something in that range probably. And so we're not talking about some sort of significant miss here. We're talking about at the margin, probably as Al just mentioned, probably a little bit lower effective occupancy just as a consequence of pushing the rents in and some of this -- this military, our secondary market segment in the third quarter took a little bit of a hit because of this onetime event that Tom has referred to. But secondary markets were back in October, running ahead of last year. So it's -- there's no trend here that is worrisome. 
David Bragg: Got it. And then the third quarter new move-in and renewal numbers of, I think you said 2.8% and 6.1%. Could you split those out for us in the secondary versus the large markets? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, give me 2 seconds. So that is -- so I've got that for the quarter, but not for the month, if that's cool. 
David Bragg: The quarter's fine. 
Thomas L. Grimes: And we were -- it skewed more on the new lease rates, it was up 4.7% and over 1% on the secondary markets, and then renewals were 6.4% and 5%. 
David Bragg: And, Tom, could you actually tell us what the new move-in gains were over the prior release, which is more comparable, it appears? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, on -- at a company-wide basis? 
David Bragg: Yes. 
Thomas L. Grimes: We were -- new leases were 3.1% and 6.3% and 4.5% for blended. So, 3.1%, new; renewals, 6.3%; blended, 4.5%. 
David Bragg: That's helpful. And my last question, Eric, on your opening comments on single-family housing. When you talk about the potential benefit, could you talk about your expectations there? And are you seeing any early signs of improved job growth in your markets? And which markets would, if not, in which markets would you expect to see that and how meaningful does that become on the revenue line? 
H. Bolton: Well, we are seeing slow recovery in employment markets taking place. As the news reports outline, the Texas markets continue to do quite well. We're -- Atlanta has been lagging, but it's showing signs of getting better as is Florida. I think that it's interesting, when you look at the impact of single-family move-out or move-outs due to single-family buying, it's actually as an example, it's actually created more pressure for us in our larger markets than it has in our secondary markets. So as I alluded to in my opening comments, the move-outs due to home-buying was only about 18%, on average. It's actually about 20% at our bigger markets in the quarter, but in the secondary markets, it was 15%. So I think that clearly as the economy hopefully begins to show more meaningful recovery and people begin to get more comfortable in their jobs, I do expect that we will probably see a little bit more activity surrounding turnover associated with buying homes. But I don't think we're headed back to anything close to what we were years ago. My guess is we get back to maybe 25% or something of our turnover and I think that that's probably a 2014 kind of phenomenon. But I think as we look into next year, it's just hard to see the single-family recovery derailing fundamentally, the rent growth and the revenue growth projections that we think we'll have going into next year. 
David Bragg: Right. But my question is actually on the other side. Are you getting more optimistic surrounding the potential for incremental job creation related to new housing construction in your market? And are you seeing any signs of that yet? 
H. Bolton: Not really. I think that your point is right. I think a recovering single-family market can have a very good implications for job growth across the country. And so, we haven't seen it yet. But I think it very well could happen. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Paula Poskon from Robert W. Baird. 
Paula Poskon: Apologies if I missed this, could you guys just run through some of the tenant credit metrics like where your rent-to-income ratio is this quarter versus last quarter and a year ago average helpful income, readings from move-out, things like that. 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, sure. The rent-to-income ratio, as Eric called it, 17%. I like to refer to it as 16.9%. So it's up about 40 basis points, but a long way away from the 20% that it was a couple of years ago. Household income is about $57,000, which has grown over time. Rents have just grown at sort of a faster rate. And then as far as move-outs for economic reasons, and I can get you an exact stat, but those things are well down. And what I don't want to over answer the question, Paula, I'd rather circle back. I got those 2 things. What did you want about the move-ins and move-outs and that sort of stuff? 
Paula Poskon: Well, really just any change in the trends and if there's significant -- if you're seeing a significant shift in the trends between primary and secondary markets, between large and secondary markets? 
Thomas L. Grimes: No. And along those things that Eric mentioned with Dave earlier, I think it's a little different than conventional wisdom that we have fewer homebuyers in our secondary markets than our primary markets. Our rent-to-income ratio is better in our secondary markets than our primary. And I think that's a little bit of a different issue as well. But they're great in both, to be perfectly honest. 
Paula Poskon: So I know -- I realized that turnover is down, but for those new tenants that are moving in, is their credit quality better or worse than the tenants that are vacating? Is there any change in that trend? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Our average, we have a sort of safe rent score that we track and I don't have the exact data points for you. But it continues to trend up each quarter. It's just sort of a steady improvement. 
Paula Poskon: And this is maybe more of a kind of anecdotal or perspective question, but portfolio-wide and then separating between large and secondary markets, what do you think -- how do you think the percentage shakes out between -- in your tenant base, between renters-by-choice and renters-by-force? 
Thomas L. Grimes: I mean if you looked at -- if you looked at the reasons for home-buying, you would come to the conclusion that the secondary markets have more renters-by-choice and they like being there and they're not exiting for home-buying. But I think that's about the only data point that we really have into that psychology, and I just wouldn't read too much into it. I think it is -- I think everyone is reacting similarly on realizing that the American dream is not always buying a home and that there's some financial stress that comes with that. And I think while we are not becoming 100% a renter nation, I think people are more comfortable with that today and I think until jobs pick up, you won't see home-buying pick up and you won't see a turnaround, I think it's 65% or so. Eric? 
H. Bolton: I would say that given the impact of us having a better credit quality resident and continued growth in average income of our resident profile, we're definitely getting folks that are, if you will, more capable of being able to buy a home. But I think the decision, what constitutes renter-by-choice or renter-by-necessity has undergone a fundamental shift. And the bottom line is there's a lot more people out there that are renters-by-choice. And I think we'll stay in that mindset for quite some time. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Just a couple of questions. Going back to Kansas City, Missouri, trying to understand what kind of demand/supply fundamentals you're seeing in that market or whether there's demographics in that market that attracted you to it and the longer-term plan in regards to how big you can get to that market to take advantage of economies of scale. 
H. Bolton: Well, Kansas City fits into our definitions of a secondary market. It's -- the other REITs are not there. It's a market where we feel like we can come in and use our balance sheet and our operating platform and our execution capabilities and create very attractive returns for our shareholder capital. It's a market that tends to have more stable characteristics, it doesn't tend to get a lot of excessive supply as you might get in some of the bigger markets and thus, we like the stable nature of that particular market. Very stable employment base there and very affordable region of the country. And this particular opportunity was a newly built property with a broker involved and developer that we know and we were able to come in and provide them a very definitive quick close and make an attractive acquisition. But what we would expect over the next several years is to see our presence there grow by another 5 or 6 properties. We'll obviously take our time and be patient about it. But we like to market as part of our secondary market strategy. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay. That's helpful. And then just sticking to the secondary market strategy as well, when I go take a look at some of your same-store statistics, and then there's a section in your supplementary, the way you kind of talk about your individual markets that have less than $30 million in gross real assets. And I'm just kind of curious, I mean in those assets that means you basically have a handful of assets. I mean, what kind of economies of scale or what kind of margins are you kind of getting in those markets when you only have 1, 2, 3 assets in those markets relative to some of your larger markets? And is there a long-term plan to also grow those markets? Or is there a long-term plan to kind of exit some of these smaller markets where you do not have the type of economies of scale. 
H. Bolton: Well, I think that just as a consequence of rotating capital out of lower margin investments into higher margin investments, what that often translates into is selling both older assets and assets where we don't have much in the way of efficiency from scale in the given market. And so, the impact of that or the consequence of cycling, you're going to see over the next several years is that these -- some of these properties that are listed in that section you're referring to will probably get sold. And we just are able to we think recycle the capital in a more effective way into markets like a Kansas City or some of the other secondary markets. So we're mindful of really, first, the margin specifically on the investment and then the overhead efficiency as well. And that will drive us to cycle out of some of these properties. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay. That's helpful. And then this question is for Al. Al, if you do end up getting the second credit upgrade sometime over the next 1 to 2 quarters, how do you see that impacting your overall cost of capital? 
Albert M. Campbell: I think it's -- we think it will have a direct impact on being able to access the bond market, probably 25, 30 basis points below where we just access the bond market on a private placement. And I think that will be the initial. I mean you've got to cut 2 phases to that, Tayo. You got 1, you can get your credit rating and you have your first time full rating, we'll go into market. I think we will have a benefit of 25 basis points or so immediately, hopefully. But then after we've been in the market for a while, maybe 1 year or 2, we'll have actually I think another step down as a well-known seasoned issuer in the market, maybe another 20 basis points or so. So let's call it, we had a spread of 235 on the recent deal, we could expect something like 200 on our initial deal then even south of that once become seasoned. So that's what we're expecting and we're hoping for. 
Omotayo Okusanya: It doesn't have any further impact on your line of credit, does it? 
Albert M. Campbell: Well, no. The line of credit impact when we got our first 2 ratings, Fitch plus Moody's, we had the impact on the lines of credit; they were written a little differently and then -- so when you go to the full bond market, though, you really need all 3 to have your best pricing performance. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Ms. Carol Kemple from Hilliard Lyons. 
Carol Kemple: Do you all have anything under contract now that -- to buy that you expect to close on by year-end? 
H. Bolton: We're working on one other deal at the moment, Carol. It's in due diligence. Not sure it will get closed, but we're working on it right now. And that's probably the only other deal that gets done by year-end if it gets done. 
Carol Kemple: Okay. And I think I missed this earlier. Overall, how much were new leasing prices up in renewals in the third quarter? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Sure. New leases were 2.8%, renewal 6.1% and blended 4.3% 
Operator: I'm showing no additional audio questions at this time. I'll turn the conference back over to you. 
H. Bolton: Okay. No further comments. I appreciate everyone joining us this morning and we'll see you at NAREIT. Thanks. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2012 Q2  (2012-08-03 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating in the MAA First (sic) [Second] Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.
 The company will first share its prepared comments, followed by a question-and-answer session. At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin. 
Leslie Bratten Cantrell Wolfgang: Thanks, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations for MAA. With me this morning are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO.
 Before we begin this morning with our prepared comments, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Eric. 
H. Bolton: Thanks, Leslie. Second quarter results, we're at the top end of our expectations, reflecting continued strong leasing conditions across our summed up markets. Given the favorable second quarter performance, accelerating rent growth and active acquisition pipeline, and the progress to-date on securing an investment grade rating, we have raised FFO guidance for the year and expect another record performance in 2012. 
 Property performance is driven by accelerating growth in pricing with continued low-resident turnover and high occupancy. We're encouraged by the trend in year-over-year pricing with the second quarter's growth and average effective rent increasing to 5.2%, as compared to 4.7% in the first quarter. We expect pricing performance will remain strong in the third quarter before we begin to see normal seasonal moderation in the holiday season. The third quarter is always a busy leasing quarter for us and we'll get a lot more clarity on real estate taxes over the next couple of months. But in summary, leasing conditions across our markets remain very good, and we're optimistic about NOI performance over the back half of the year. 
 As detailed in the second quarter release, the Large Markets segment of our portfolio continues to perform very well with 7.7% NOI growth for the quarter. Our Secondary Markets segment also delivered very solid performance with 5.2% NOI growth. This difference in performance between market segments is in line with our full cycle portfolio strategy, and is what we expect at this point in the cycle. Until we see new supply trends pick up in a more meaningful way, I expect we will see this performance pattern, with our Large Markets segment outperforming our Secondary Market segment. However, with minimal new permitting activity underway in the Secondary Market segment of the portfolio, we expect that we will see the ratio of job growth-to-new supply begin to favor the Secondary Market, so the portfolio by mid-to-late 2013. 
 And let me expand on this point just a little. In thinking about the likely future direction of market conditions and the outlook for leasing, we compare job growth forecast to expected new supply, which we based off of actual permitting activity. During the last recovery cycle from 2004 to 2007, across our markets, we saw 7 new jobs created for each completed unit associated with new development permits being pulled, or a ratio of 7:1. Given the current increasing trend in permitting activity and the continued slow recovery in the employment market, the current outlook for our large-tier market is that the ratio of new jobs to new supply will moderate from a current 14:1, to an expected ratio of 8:1 next year, more or less in line with national trends. 
 Now what's important to recognize is that this is still a very healthy leasing environment, and is better than the ratios we experienced during the last recovery cycle. And this is, of course, especially true considering today's lower propensity for new and existing households to become homeowners, as compared to the 2004 to 2007 time frame. 
 Now looking at our Secondary Markets, the story is even better. Based on the forecast we have, we expect the ratio of job growth-to-new supply in our Secondary Markets will actually improve slightly next year to 11:1, from the 10:1 relationship that we have today. There are, of course, a lot of different ways to underwrite the risk associated with new supply increase in any given market or region. But based on how we measure and assess the apartment-leasing environment heading into 2013, we continue to feel good about our ability to capture solid rent growth across our portfolio over the balance of this year and through 2013. 
 On the transaction front, our group remains active and is underwriting quite a bit of opportunity at the moment. As outlined in our earnings release, we have raised our outlook for new acquisitions to a range of $300 million to $350 million. The environment remains competitive, but as we get closer to year end, we find that our established record of being able to move quickly and definitively through due diligence enclosed on the transaction, attracts more interest. We've closed on $191 million in acquisitions so far this year and expect to continue with an active capital recycling effort into higher margin investments over the next couple of years. As we pursue new investment alternatives, we remain committed to our Sunbelt footprint and our 2-tier market strategy across the region. 
 As noted in our earnings release, Moody's assigned an initial investment grade rating to MAA during the second quarter, reflecting the work and commitment made to further strengthen our balance sheet and broaden access to capital. We have more work to accomplish in growing our unencumbered asset base, but we are well on our way towards completing this goal. We currently have over $260 million of capacity available for cash and in-place credit facilities, and are well-positioned to continue supporting new growth objectives. 
 So in summary, we're encouraged with the outlook for continued solid NOI growth from both our same-store and non same-store properties. Our new development lease-ups are performing better than is projected, and are expected to make an increasingly meaningful contribution to FFO performance over the next couple of years. We believe MAA is well-positioned to continue capturing solid results in this robust part of the market cycle, while retaining solid downside protection as market conditions eventually cycle, or if more pronounced weakness in the economy were to occur. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Al for more insights on our Q2 results. Al? 
Albert M. Campbell: Okay, thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide comments on earnings performance for the second quarter as well as a few highlights regarding investing and financing activities. FFO for the quarter was $48.3 million or $1.13 per share which was $0.06 above the midpoint of our prior guidance, and Eric mentioned, is another record for the company. The strong result for the quarter was produced by several areas of our business, all performing above expectations, including the same-store portfolio, development activities, as well as financing costs. 
 Same-store NOI grew 6.5% in the second quarter, based on a 4.6% increase in revenues and a 1.9% increase in operating expenses. Revenue growth was driven by a 5.2% increase in effective rents, compared to the prior year, which was essentially in-line with expectations. Operating expenses moderated more than projected from the first quarter, primarily due to personnel and repair maintenance costs, producing about $0.02 per share of favorability to our forecast. Non same-store communities, consisting of development and recent acquisitions, also outperformed expectations during the second quarter, producing an additional $0.02 per share in favorability, the majority of which was related to 2 development communities currently in lease-up, Cool Springs in Nashville and the Ridge at Chenal Valley in Little Rock, which are both ahead of plan. 
 The remaining $0.02 per share favorability for the quarter comes from financing and acquisition costs, about 1/2 of this or $0.01 per share is timing in nature, related to lower-than-projected deal volume in the second quarter, which we now expect to occur in the third quarter. During the second quarter, we acquired 2 wholly-owned communities and purchased the remaining 2/3 interest in one community from Fund II, the company's joint venture. And in July, we purchased an additional wholly-owned community, bringing year-to-date acquisitions, including the joint-venture purchase, to just over $191 million at an overall average NOI yield of about 6%. 
 As part of our disposition plans for the year, we sold one community during the second quarter and 4 additional communities in July and early August. These sales bring year-to-date proceeds from property dispositions to about $88.5 million, from which we expect to report total net gains of about $33 million. We have 2 remaining communities planned for sale this year, which are in a contract phase, and we expect our overall cap rate for this year's disposition portfolio to be about 6.75%, based on in-place earnings, after deducting a 4% management fee and a $350 per unit CapEx reserve.
 Construction and lease-up continues to progress very well in the 4 communities currently under development. During the second quarter, we funded an additional $16 million toward completion, bringing the total investment to $97.1 million of the expected full construction costs of $143.6 million. 1/3 or 405 of the planned units were delivered as of the end of the second quarter, which were 96% leased at REIT levels exceeding pro forma. We expect to complete the construction on 3 of the 4 communities by year end, and with the remaining community to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
 Regarding our balance sheet and financing activities. During the second quarter, we used unsecured proceeds from our recent term loan and bank credit facility to fund acquisition and development activity, and to repay secured agency debt. During the quarter, we repaid an additional $150 million of our agency credit facilities, releasing the related mortgages, which along with the acquisition activity, increased our unencumbered asset pool to 48% of gross assets at the end of the second quarter, as compared to 31% at year end. 
 As Eric mentioned, in July, we received the first-time investment grade rating from Moody's of Baa2, which is the second level of investment grade under their rating scale. This rating, along with our existing BBB rating from Fitch, reflects the solid progress to our balance sheet goals, and immediately reduces the cost of our borrowings under both our bank credit facility and recent term loan, which have built-in investment grade pricing options. The credit spreads on borrowings under these agreements are now 135 to 150 basis points over LIBOR, or a 30 to 40 basis-points reduction from the first quarter. 
 We ended the second quarter with our balance sheet in a very strong position. Our net debt was 43.5% of gross assets and 6.7x EBITDA. And our EBITDA covered fixed charges 4.4x. And also at the end of the quarter, 91% of our outstanding debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates, resulting in a total average effective rate of about 3.8% for the quarter. We believe these metrics put us in a very good position to pursue an additional credit rating from S&P, with a goal of achieving full investment grade position, late this year or early next year. 
 And finally, given the second quarter performance and updated expectations for the remainder of the year, we're increasing our FFO per share guidance for the full year by $0.09 per share at the midpoint, $0.06 of which relates to the second quarter. In the remainder of the year, we do expect our same-store and non same-store portfolios combined, to add about $0.04 per share to the results, and we expect an additional $0.01 per share contribution from lower volume costs, primarily related to receiving the initial -- the additional investment grade rating earlier than anticipated. We expect these favorable items to be partially offset by about $0.02 per share of additional acquisition costs, related to both the timing of deals and the volume of deals this year. 
 Our updated FFO guidance for the full year is now a range of $4.37 to $4.57 per share, which is $4.47 at the midpoint, or a 12% increase over the prior year. And as a reminder, the key assumptions included in our forecast, a wholly-owned acquisition volume of $300 million to $350 million, disposition volume of $100 million to $125 million, and development funding of $80 million to $85 million for the year. We also expect our leverage in the year in the 43% to 46% range, with about 93% of our debt, fixed or hedged, with an average interest rate ranging from 3.8% to 3.9% for the full year. 
 We currently have 1.7 million shares or about $115 million capacity remaining under our current ATM program, and we intend to utilize our ATM program to essentially manage or fund our acquisition volume over the remainder of the year. That's all that we have in a way of prepared comments. So Jonathan, I'll turn the call over to you for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald. 
David Toti: Eric, I want to go back to the Secondary Market performance a little bit, just so we can maybe understand some of the dynamics in the numbers. Is it possible you could disclose the new with renewal rates in the Secondary Markets of the quarter. And then, possibly walk us through the change in occupancy on a year-over-year basis, relative to those assets. 
H. Bolton: Sure, I'm going to let Tom do that. He's got the information handy here. 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, and I'll back into that real quick. On a new and renewal rates for the Secondary Markets for -- sorry to be a little behind on this, but we had about 3% on new rates and 5% on renewals. And then on the occupancy component, I think that's covered in the Q. It went down a bit, but really driven by military move-outs in 3 of our markets in Columbus, Savannah and Virginia. Those were temporary moves. The third infantry brigade deploying in Columbus, and a carrier moving out in Virginia, and those have recovered since. 
David Toti: Okay. That's very helpful. And then, I guess another question for you is, expense growth seems to have moderated somewhat in the second quarter, and we've seen a rather elevated expense growth of other, sort of your peers. Is this aberrational in the quarter? It seems like it's actually below guidance at the moment. Are you expecting sort of bigger problems in the second half? Is part of that tax driven potentially? 
Albert M. Campbell: It is, Dave. This is Al. I can answer that. And we still have our range of 3.5 to 4.5 for total expenses for the year. Now, as we mentioned in the press release, we'll probably end up at the low end of that. So some of the moderation that we saw in the second quarter will carry through. The large part of it, the moderation was expected. It just occurred a little faster and a little sharper than we have projected. So we still think we'll end at the low end of that expense range that we gave for the year. A big portion, as you mentioned, is real estate taxes, which we have and always set for the year, was between 4% and 5%. Midpoint of that 4.5% is what we still expect, and we think that's about right, given the information that we received for the -- so far this quarter. The pressure points are coming from the places we thought and it's about what we expected. And we'll have more for that -- on that in the third quarter, have more clarity, but we expect it to be in the low end of our guidance in total for expenses. 
David Toti: Okay, that's helpful. And then my last question is just around -- some of you guys mentioned, relative to capital recycling going forward, now that some of your balance sheet goals are out of the way, and there's been some aggressive growth. What kind of assets can we expect to see in the disposition category in the next couple of years? How do you guys define assets that are right for disposition? 
H. Bolton: David, it really just starts with the process of identifying those assets that have the lowest after-CapEx cash flow margin, and we have no real intent making any sort of -- to make any sort of strategic shift out of a given region or given market. It really is just looking at those investments that are producing after-CapEx cash flow that are below the margins, that we feel like we can get elsewhere. And now what that means, as you might imagine, after-CapEx cash flow, it often translates into lower or older properties, and also it translates into properties that have lower rent structure. And as a consequence of that, you're going to see, obviously, then us, likely moving more and more out of some of the older properties. And some of the older properties, a lot of which came with the merger that we did with Flournoy Company back in 1997, also happened to be in some sort of beyond Secondary, almost really -- you would define almost as Tertiary Markets. And so that's -- and that's where you're going to see most of the capital cycled out of our other older assets and in some of the real Secondary Markets. We, again, are remaining very committed to the Secondary Market segment of our portfolio, and -- but you're going to see a cycling capital pie, a little bit more actively, in that component of the portfolio. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson for Macquarie. 
Robert Stevenson: Eric, just as a follow-up to that last question, what is the gap between whatever it is, the bottom 5%, 10%, 20% of your portfolio in terms of operating margin versus the sort of average? 
H. Bolton: I think it's a couple of percent. That's what I would say, and probably 2%, and maybe 3% at the very bottom. But that's probably a good indication of it, Rob. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay, so over time, you could -- you're going to -- would sell assets that have 200 to 300 basis points lower operating margins, and so, that should possibly benefit your overall operating margins as a firm? 
H. Bolton: Absolutely. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay, and then, Al, just on the guidance level, I mean, you guys are tracking for the first 6 months -- and maybe it's a question for Tom. But you're tracking at 4.5% revenue growth, your guidance is 4.5% to 5.5%, I think. Like, what's happening in the back half of the year that's going to cause an acceleration from where you were in the first half versus, I think a lot of your peers are forecasting sort of decelerating revenue growth? 
Albert M. Campbell: I'll tell you what the forecast is built on and Tom can come in and give you some operating reasons of why that is, but the acceleration in the third quarter is because a lot of leasing activity comes in the third quarter, and that's when we get our pricing power. So we expect some movement there. And in the fourth quarter, I think it's the continued trend that we see this year. We'll have some moderation from seasonality projected, but in large element, the trend forward will continue and there's a comparison opportunity in the fourth quarter this year, compared with the prior year. That's a big part of the acceleration in the fourth quarter. And so that's been built in our forecast all year, I would say, and it's so far, performing about the line with expectations. 
H. Bolton: Yes, Rob. I think that's really just a compounding of the new rent growth. We will see some seasonal moderation in the fourth quarter on pricing, but what we've built in on our pricing will matter more than those few leases, that rent at a lower number in the fourth quarter, and we've got some good occupancy comparisons in the fourth quarter as well. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then, Eric, what are you seeing today in terms of the market for acquisitions? Are you seeing a lot of people bringing product on the market to try to get it out under the current tax regime, and trying to get them closed by year end? Has that not been a factor thus far, any interest in OP units, et cetera? 
H. Bolton: Well there's certainly a lot of volume in the market right now. We're underwriting a whole lot of deals, more than I can remember us ever looking at. And so it's very active. I do think that there is some motivation by a lot of capital to take advantage of what is obviously a very attractive financing environment, a very attractive operating environment and probably one of the more favorable tax windows that we'll have for some time. And so all those factors are, I think, are suggesting that anybody that's got any intent on moving out of investment, they're looking to do that between now and year end. I think that occasionally, we'll run into folks that are looking for some sort of tax-free exchange, but honestly, not very often. I think more often than not, we'll see that with some of the portfolio transactions that I occasionally come across. But on most of these one-off transactions that we're doing, it's really more just cash acquisitions. 
Robert Stevenson: Are you looking at any new markets this round? 
H. Bolton: Not -- well -- Kansas City is a market that we've been looking at some deals in. We're -- but other than that, no. I mean, we continue to like the region and broadly the footprint that we're in. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from BMO Capital. 
Richard Anderson: Can I just get back quickly to the margin discussion, can you quantify that? What absolute level of operating margins do you think you can buy at, is it over 70%? What's the number? 
H. Bolton: I don't think it's that high. 
Albert M. Campbell: 60. 
H. Bolton: It's going to be in the -- I'll call it 60 to 70 range. 
Albert M. Campbell: And the number I threw out, Rich, just to clarify, the 2 to 3 is probably the bottom level of what we'll be selling from the midpoint of the portfolio, that's a good point. If the new assets that we'll buy will have the lowest, the best margins and, probably better, that gap will be wider than. 
Richard Anderson: Next question on development. I'm curious with your thought processes to be a developer in any level. I mean, given the incremental risk associated with development, it's such a small percentage of your overall kind of operating strategy, why even bother developing? You're probably aren't going to get paid for it anyway, in my opinion. What were your thoughts on that? 
H. Bolton: My thought is this: We did not want to be developer. We do, however, want to find opportunities to deploy capital in new assets on an attractive basis. And we think that the way to accomplish that is to essentially outsource our development operation, by essentially hiring developers that come to us with opportunity. We negotiate a contract. They essentially take the development risk, because these are contracts with fixed price. We take the lease up and then that's really it. And we're also mindful of how much of that we want to take on the balance sheet at any point in time. But we just don't think that being a big developer, and take on the overhead associated with that, is the right thing for us to do. 
Albert M. Campbell: Rich, remember our NOI yield expectation for our current pipeline is 7.5% to 8%. Compare that to 6.5% on acquisitions right now. So there's still a good spread there to capture in this part of the cycle and so -- and in our developments, what we're doing are ahead of plan. So that's all good news. 
Richard Anderson: Eric, I'd like to get to the conversation you had about jobs permit, unit permit? I think you said it was running at 7x in the last cycle and it's higher than that this time around because of the lack of desire to own a home. I think that's what you said. Is that about right? 
H. Bolton: Yes, during the last recovery cycle, 7:1. During this particular year, it's 14:1. So it's double, if you will. But it's really a function of 2 things. One, it's a function of the propensity for renters to stay in a rental market but, fundamentally, it's because there hasn't been any supply delivered into the market for the last couple of years. 
Richard Anderson: What are these jobs that are being created? Are they construction jobs, are they -- what kind of jobs are they? And do they all matter to you as an apartment landlord? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Rich, it's Tom. We can run through it. In Houston it's oil and gas. In Dallas, it's technology. In Charleston, it's manufacturing. Across the Sun Belt, it's a range of things that are not temporary in nature and are, frankly, been historically strong to the Sunbelt. So I mean, they're there and we're chugging along. It matters. Every job matters. 
Robert Stevenson: Peter, just coincidental events, right? The jobs are happening and permitting is happening, but they're not necessarily tethered together, one-to-one. Is that what you're trying to say? I'm just trying to understand the logic a little bit. 
H. Bolton: What I'm trying to say is that, I think in order to have a healthy leasing environment, one has to obviously look at the amount of new supply coming into the market and whether you should be alarmed or not about that level of new supply coming into a market, depends upon whether or not there's going to be enough job growth, to handle and absorb that supply. And while, I think, there's a lot of hand wringing that's starting to take place about permitting activity being up as much as it has grown over the last couple of years, obviously, from very depressed levels, I don't think it's something to be overly concerned about. I think we're going to go from an environment where we've seeing, if you will, just unbelievably good fundamentals to probably, as a result of supply coming into the market, to an environment where it's going from unbelievably good to just really good. And I think that's what we're trending. 
Richard Anderson: Okay, that clarifies that. And then, Eric, last question for you, probably you've been asked this question many times, but you consider your company kind of the defensive, or having defensive characteristics, maybe not shared by some of your peers, a full-cycle type of story. So why should -- if fundamentals are white-hot right now, what would be the reason for people to buy MAA stock and not some of your peers? Or are you saying maybe that things are starting to get to peaking conditions, development is starting to pick up and then that in itself is a reason to maybe look at MAA a little bit more closely because of its defensive characteristics. 
H. Bolton: Well, again, our objective is to be the best full-cycle performer that we can be. And I think that while we have defensive characteristics, if you will, I think that we also have the capability to be very competitive in this phase of the cycle also. And our objective is to be in a position to deliver very competitive performance within the growth cycle, if you will, and to retain, though, the downside protection as much as we can. I think that our story should have appeal for, to some degree, it depends on your investment horizon. Our thought process is built on the basis that we think to deliver the -- our shareholder performance horizon that we're aiming for is really designed to match or align the horizon that we use for deploying capital. When we buy properties, those properties are assumed to be owned 7 to 10 years. That's the kind of horizon that we have to think about in terms of delivering performance for shareholders as well, because that's how we deploy capital. And of course, over that kind of horizon, you have up parts and you have down parts. And what I can tell you is that, over that kind of a horizon, and if you look at over the last 7 to 10 years, when you look at our total shareholder return and what it's been compared to others, what's important to recognize is that roughly about 2/3 of that performance for our shareholders has been the dividend that we've paid. And we think, ultimately, that's what the REIT platform is all about. It's all about trying to deliver total shareholder return over a long period of time, a lot of that return being composed of the dividend. And so, our objective is to take some of the cyclicality out of equation. Take some of the cyclicality out of the performance in an effort to support the ability to fund a steady growing dividend, sort of, no matter what. Through good times and bad times. And so I think you have to be willing to bring a little bit of downside protection into your story and onto your balance sheet and how you deploy capital. You have to have that component in there to achieve that kind of long-term performance. And in return, what you have to be willing to do is give up, perhaps, a little bit of the froth at the very top end of the market. And we think that's okay. We're comfortable with that kind of a profile. 
Richard Anderson: Well said. 
Operator: Our next question comes on the line of Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. 
Michael Salinsky: You talked about developments running a little bit ahead of underwriting. Can you give us a sense of how much that's running ahead? And will you expect those to pencil out now? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, no. I mean, we're feeling pretty good. Venue in Nashville, we expect it to be 41% occupied, and they're 53% occupied and we expected 1/2 month's rent concession to do lease-up and then we're not running with any lease-up concessions. And it's the same story, really, Ridge, we expected them, actually, they're a little further ahead to be 22% and they're 52% occupied. Same story on the lease-ups. 
Albert M. Campbell: Yes, I was just going to say, Tom mentioned it, it's all about timing of the lease-up and the lack of concessions and, as we ended the year, I think, we had $0.10 to $0.12 per share dilution from our pipeline, and probably going to be more like $0.04 to $0.06, or $0.04 to $0.07 this year. So it's a very good story. I think the yields that we'll achieve on this portfolio continue to be 7.5 per 8 but the IRR, once we're done with these things, would be better because we're avoiding largely dilutive prospects at the initial parts of these projects. 
Michael Salinsky: That's encouraging. Second question, more operations. Can you give us what new lease and renewal rents, lease over B-spaces were in the second quarter and also for July? And where you ended July on an occupancy basis? 
H. Bolton: On July, on occupancy was 96 and then new lease was for the second quarter was 4 2, renewals 6 2 and for July, 3 2 and 6 5. 
Michael Salinsky: That's lease over lease, correct? 
Thomas L. Grimes: That is year-over-year. Lease over lease was 4 1 and 6 6, and 4 and almost 7 for July. 
Michael Salinsky: Al, a question for you, you talked on your last call about looking at a term loan or private placement in the second half of the year. Is that still in the plan for 2012? And also where would you expect pricing given the debt upgrade there? 
Albert M. Campbell: It is, Mike. As we talked about before and as you've seen it on our balance sheet, we paid down our secured financing from agencies using a bit of our credit facility. And so, we expect one more transaction this year, probably in the range of $100 million to $150 million, likely private placement term loan, the best product in town and we'll have more on that in our upcoming releases. I think it's safe to say, right now, surprising on a 10-year basis, we may blend 7 and 10 years, so that will change somewhat. But safe to say, somewhere in the 4% to 4.5%, maybe 4% to 4.25% expectation for that over the -- probably be funded -- begin funding late third quarter and likely be staged somewhat 50-50 in 50. You know, my 50 a month for a few months late in the year, Mike. So that should help you model out and get you pretty close to where we are. 
Michael Salinsky: Final question for Eric. We haven't really seen a whole lot of activity on the JV front and I was kind of going after value add. What are you seeing in terms of value add and does it still make sense today, given the compression we've seen in cap rates? 
H. Bolton: Well I think, what we're finding is that the value add transactions that come to market, these are properties that we characterize as sort of 8 to 12 years old. The competition on those is really fierce because those are assets that are fairly easily financed and, in this environment, the private capital folks are able to get very attractive financing terms and, as a consequence, put some pretty big numbers on the table. And based on what deals we've seen, where pricing has traded, they've we've also made some fairly heroic assumptions regarding the ability to raise rents and capture a lot of value out of whatever repositioning plan they plan to execute on. So it's really, frankly, just a matter of very aggressive pricing in that particular transaction set that has caused us to not see a lot of opportunities there that makes sense for us. 
Michael Salinsky: The final question. At this point in the cycle, you come for what your concentrations in primary versus secondary? Or is there an impetus maybe to increase the primary a little bit more to capture some growth over the next couple of years? 
H. Bolton: No, I mean, we've taken a hard look at this for quite some time and continue to believe that the current allocation that we have, which we define at roughly about 60% large and 40% secondary. I mean, optimally, the range is for 60% to 65% large and 35% to 40% secondary. We think that creates the optimum sort of portfolio cash flow performance profile that we're after in terms of long-term growth without -- with some of the volatility taken out of it. And so, we're pretty comfortable with allocation we have now. And again, going back to my point in our prepared comments, when you look at where supply is starting to get teed up, it's as always, it's in some of the larger markets and, in many cases, it's in a lot of the more urban locations in some of these larger markets. And eventually, that's going to manifest itself into leasing conditions, in some of these larger markets, and as I quoted in my comments, the ratio of sort of job growth to permits in secondary markets are actually going to be -- at least based on what we're looking at, and what we're seeing right now, are going to get better and more in our favor, if you will, next year. So I think, trying to move a bunch of cap out of our secondary markets into large markets right now would be the absolute wrong thing to do. 
Michael Salinsky: I appreciate the detail. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg of Zelman & Associates. 
David Bragg: So those comments on portfolio allocation are helpful and as was your -- the disciplined approach to dispositions that you conveyed, but the question is, just within the secondary markets over the near-term or intermediate term, what's the opportunity to reallocate within those markets and maybe increase your concentration to more desirable secondary markets and reduce concentration or exposure to some MSAs that you are in and are not as attracted to, long-term? 
H. Bolton: I think that's where a lot of the opportunity in this recycling effort is going to be aimed at over the next couple of years. Again, it starts with a definition of where are we seeing opportunities to redeploy capital in higher after CapEx margin cash flows. And what that is normally translating into is some of the older assets. As a consequence of portfolio transactions, we went through back in 1997 with the Flournoy Company. It happens that a lot of the older assets are in some of these more tertiary type markets. And so, I think you'll see us over the next couple of years continue to cycle out of certain secondary markets and into, I would call it, perhaps secondary markets that are a little bit more well-known and our goal is that we think that, that process would yield higher after CapEx cash flow and likely we think, over time, that the public market probably puts a better multiple on that cash flow as a consequence of moving capital out of, let’s say, Macon, Georgia into Charleston. Or out of Macon, Georgia into Savannah. My guess is that over time, that kind of creates a better performance profile for the company and I think also garners a little bit more appreciation in terms of pricing them, and the company has a multiple of that cash flow. 
David Bragg: Right. That makes sense. Next, could you talk about the Buckhead submarket of Atlanta and your interest there? Investing in a submarket like that seems a little different from your typical approach and so I was curious what you're seeing there and if we could interpret this as being an indicator of a shift in strategy towards more urban submarkets. 
James Andrew Taylor: David, it's really not any sort of shift in strategy. I mean, our capital deployment practice is really geared towards, first and foremost, looking for those opportunities where we think -- where people want to live. And where there's the proximity to employment, good retail and just a desirable area to live in. And then from there, it becomes just a question of looking for opportunities that we could capture on pricing that makes sense, for how we model and deploy capital. And it just so happens that, frankly, over the last 2 to 3 years, some of the better opportunities that we've seen have been in some of the more the urban-type submarkets in some of these cities. That's where a lot of stuff was built over the last several years and where a lot of distress took place. And so consequently, that's where some of the best buying opportunities have emerged for us this year. Now we think an added benefit from all that is that we probably do further diversify in some of these bigger markets with a mix of both suburban and urban locations, which I think probably has some value long-term, in terms of performance stability. But there's really no intent to make any shift from suburban to urban, or one way or the other. It's really just, let's go where people want to live. And as we've pointed out in the past, a lot of these southeastern cities, a lot of the employment centers are out in the suburbs. And so, that's what drove out there to begin with. It's not because we -- it's necessarily some of the best buying opportunities, we want to go where people wanted to be, where they wanted to live. And then it becomes a question of: "okay, now, let's find the best pricing opportunity." And it just so happens that these 2 recent acquisitions in Buckhead were presented to us. We like the assets a lot, the pricing worked and we bought them. 
David Bragg: Can we interpret that your intermediate rent growth outlook for the urban submarkets of Atlanta is pretty nicely superior to your outlook for the suburban markets? And perhaps in part due to the lack of supply there? 
H. Bolton: I think that -- of course every market, and every situation, is a little bit unique. But, no, I mean, I think that our outlook for rent growth is not -- based on what we're looking at, we don't see it being particularly strong in suburbs versus particularly strong in the urban areas. I think that you're right, and that a lot of the supply it is picking up, to some degree, in some of these bigger markets. Today, it has been more in the urban core part of the city. And my guess is that you may see fundamentals flatten a little bit quicker there, as opposed to some of the suburban locations over the next year or so. But I think that the only thing that would -- it'd really be more of a supply question and -- but from what we see right now, we're still expecting to capture pretty strong rent growth out of many of our suburban locations over the balance of this year. 
David Bragg: And last question is, can you update us on the competition you're seeing with single-family housing move outs to buy and rent? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Sure, Dave. The move outs to -- for home buying's up slightly about 4%, or 42 units, but still 18.3% of total move outs versus like 17.8% and not a material move there, and certainly not up around the highs of the 30% that we've seen before. And the move outs due to home renting has gone down 1.7%. It's now less than 6% of move outs and it just -- continues not to be much of a factor. 
Operator: Our next question comes the line of Paula Poskon from Robert W. Baird. 
Paula Poskon: Apologies if I missed this in your prepared or earlier Q&A. Are you -- do you have -- currently marketing anything for sale? 
Albert M. Campbell: We do have 2 other properties that are for sale right now. They're in the contract phase and expecting to close late third, early fourth quarter kind of range, Paula. 
Paula Poskon: Have you already reclassified those, Al, as discontinued ops? 
Albert M. Campbell: One of them is in the balance sheet as available for sale, the other one is not because it has yet to hit the bright -- or didn't, at the end of the quarter, the bright line for that test. But, yes. One is in there, you'll see it in the balance sheet. 
Paula Poskon: And what's the cap rate spread between what you're buying and selling at? 
Albert M. Campbell: We have on the whole portfolio this year, we expect about 6.7% x of cap rate. That's on in place cash flow after 4% management fee and 350 CapEx on the disposition. And so we're -- so that's -- and we talked about on our buying has historically been 5.5% to 6% range. So that hopefully gives you somewhat the spread. 
Paula Poskon: Yes, that's helpful. And are you considering moving more assets out of the fund onto the wholly-owned on balance sheet? What's the opportunity set there? 
H. Bolton: Not really. I think that the one transaction that we did in Austin was just a unique situation where our partner was looking to create a transaction for their capital and we sort of looked at that property. Obviously there's some supply that's trying to pick up in Austin and they just felt that, that was an opportunity to cycle out of that one. We took a hard look at the asset and given our horizon, and the way we thought about the market, we were able to offer them a price that made sense for us, made sense for them. So that's what we did. I think that, more often than not, honestly, you're going to see us, when we make a decision to sell an asset out of the JV, more often than not, it will just be taking the market as opposed to us buying the interest back. We're not actively selling anything else right now in any of our JVs. 
Paula Poskon: That's helpful. And speaking of Austin, just 1 final question. There's certainly a lot of construction underway in terms of the purpose-built student housing close to campus there. Do you anticipate any impact in your Austin properties? Do have a big percentage of your residents that are students? 
Albert M. Campbell: No, we don't, Paula. We're out a bit from University of Texas, we certainly love the jobs that it throws off but we are not heavily exposed to the UT students. 
Paula Poskon: That's all I have. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. 
Buck Horne: Can you give us an update on the rent income metrics for your incoming tenants and just how that may compare year-over-year? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Sure. The rent-to-income ratios, and I'll back it up a bit, in sort of '08, '09, it got as high as 19% and it is steadily worked its way down and we're at 16% rent-to-income ratio today. 
Buck Horne: How does that vary between large market versus secondary markets? Do you have that kind of granularity? 
Thomas L. Grimes: I do not. Not on that statistic. 
H. Bolton: I'll get it for you. I don't think it's that big a spread difference, to be honest with you. 
Buck Horne: And on your turnover. Do you know how many move outs were citing rent increases or the rent was too high as the reason of the move out? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, yes, it's 13% of move outs for us. We're at rent increase and that's a number that we comfortably control and it's been offset by lack of job loss and job transfer, so we're happy with that number and we replaced those folks that moved out with rents that are paying 8% higher than they were, so it's still making sense at this point. 
Buck Horne: Just one last one. It's kind of demographic question I have for you. Just thinking about the average age of your incoming tenant, have you seen any changes in the average age of who you're renting to or at least who's walking through the door these days? 
Thomas L. Grimes: I mean, that's stayed largely consistent. I mean, I think we'll see it pull down or actually I think we'll see it track sort of the eco-boomers' midpoint, but it has not changed materially. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Swaroop Yalla from Morgan Stanley. 
Swaroop Yalla: I'd like to get some more color on the Florida markets. It looks like south Florida is doing quite well and your bigger markets like Jacksonville and Orlando are not. I mean, what is the cause of the dichotomy there? And if you're considering sort of reallocating your capital there in Florida? 
Thomas L. Grimes: I'll answer that quickly. South Florida is -- you're looking at one asset in a very specific location with a good, good school district there in Coral Springs. And it weathered the storm extraordinarily well. So it's sort of specific submarket has allowed to do quite well over time. On the Jacksonville front, Jacksonville is coming back reasonably well, but it's just not rebounding as fast as the Texas markets go. But we're encouraged by where it's heading. They've been able to grow rents reasonably well this year and occupancy for the quarter was 95.7%. July, it's picked up a little bit more to 97% exposure at 7 5. So we feel like the fundamentals of Jacksonville, while they have been slower to turn than our asset in south Florida, has done -- is coming. There's more to come out of Jacksonville. 
Swaroop Yalla: Great. And then I was just wondering if you guys have the ratio of jobs to permits by individual markets and in particular I'm thinking about Raleigh and Dallas, and maybe even Austin. But do you guys have that by the market? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Sure. I'll be glad to run through that. With Dallas, it's currently 10:3, Raleigh the same thing, 10:3. We do actually have different numbers there for it, I'm not making that up. And then just circling back to Jacksonville, it has been -- it's been a little bit -- it's been low at 6, which is that slow job creation coming on, but picks up a ton next year. And it will be almost 12. 
H. Bolton: What we'll be glad to do, I'm sorry, but if you're interested is off-line, just give us a call and we can give it to you by market. 
Swaroop Yalla: No, that'll be very helpful. And lastly, Al, is there any update on S&P ratings and if that will do anything further for your borrowing costs? 
Albert M. Campbell: That's a good question. What we feel like we're in a very good position to continue our discussions with those -- with S&P and we believe that by late this year, we're hopefully in a very good position to achieve our goals of getting ratings from all 3. And once we do that, it will have an impact on our borrowings because I think we'll be in a position to access the full public bond market. And so, I mean, I know you've probably seen some of the transactions that have happened over the last few months, but it's been very aggressive. Some people rated at this Baa2 level, have gotten very attractive 10-year financing costs. So I'm talking in the 3.4%, 3.5% range for 10 years. So certainly, that's a very favorable future for us and we hope that we can achieve that level and get some of that type of financing next year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew McCulloch from Green Street Advisors. 
Andy McCulloch: Just one follow-up to David Bragg's question. Have you guys changed your underwriting assumptions at all in acquisitions? I mean, Mid-America has always been very conservative in its underwriting, especially on component, especially at the cap rate. And the secondary and tertiary markets where you've historically targeted, where competition is really less intense, you've always been able to source plenty of deals even after this conservative underwriting. But in some of these primary markets, like Buckhead, where you've been more active of late and where competition has to be a lot more intense, it's a little surprising you can win some of these deals, again, under what's you've had historically, very conservative underwriting. Can you just comment on that? 
H. Bolton: The answer is no. We've not changed our underwriting approach at all. The methodology that we've used historically is absolutely being used again today. I think that, honestly, the 2 deals that we've acquired were just unique -- in Buckhead, were just unique situations where the properties have been in the contract previously before. Sellers involved had some very hard deadlines and some things that they had to get accomplished in a very short order, and we were able to move very quickly and definitively, and offer that sort of assurance. See these are brokers involved, that we've done a lot of business with, and they really went to bat for us. And so, I mean, really, we find in today's environment, that really, it's just very competitive both in more the urban areas as well as in the suburbs. And it really just comes down to looking for scenarios where our ability to move very quickly and definitively through the due diligence and close, has a lot of value. And ironically, we find, as you might imagine, we find that we get more value for that, if you will, as we get into this third and fourth quarters of the year. Often, we find a lot of transactions that are initially brought to market that we don't get -- we don't get under contract the first part of the year, they often come back around during the third and fourth quarter of the year. And that's when we're able to offer the seller our execution capability, that they put a lot of value on. But, no, quickly, we certainly add to -- we've not changed our underwriting approach at all. 
Operator: This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks. 
H. Bolton: Okay. Jonathan, appreciate it, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Just let us know if you have any other questions. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-05-04 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating in the MAA First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. The company will first share its prepared comments, followed by a question-and-answer session. At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin. 
Leslie Bratten Cantrell Wolfgang: Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations for MAA. With me is Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. 
 Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Eric. 
H. Bolton: Thanks, Leslie, and welcome, everyone, on our call this morning. 
 Mid-America's first quarter result is the highest FFO per share performance in our 18-year history. FFO per share increased 14% over the prior year to $1.12 per share. Leasing conditions are strong, and we expect to capture increasing positive momentum from our same-store portfolios we have into the peak leasing season. 
 As outlined in our earnings release, we have increased FFO guidance for the year to a range of $4.28 to $4.48 per share or $4.38 at the midpoint. 
 Strong leasing conditions generated positive rent and revenue growth in each of our markets across the portfolio. As expected, during the first quarter, we did see an increase in resident turnover with move-outs increasing to 56.4% on a rolling 12-month basis from 54.2% at this time last year. The increase was primarily fueled by our more aggressive push on rents, as move-outs due to rent increases is now driving 12% of our resident turnover, which is up from 6% at this time last year. 
 We're comfortable with this result for 2 reasons. First, overall resident turnover remains near historic lows as pressure from residents leaving to buy a home continues to fall. Secondly, we captured, on average, close to a 9% rent increase from the new residents moving in as compared to those residents moving out due to the rent increase. We believe the long-term benefits associated with repricing units at this level of increase is worth some uptick in current quarter vacancy loss and a higher turn cost resulting from the forced turnover. 
 During the quarter, we captured a significant increase in move-ins, growing a strong 13.2% over Q1 of last year. Leasing traffic was up 8% as compared to last year and fueled the ability to capture the high volume of move-ins during the quarter and also supported the ability to end the quarter at a strong 96.2% physical occupancy. 
 For the quarter, on a sequential basis, we captured 110 basis-points growth in occupancy. And as a result, we have the portfolio in a great position heading into the busy summer leasing season. 
 It's important to note that with this higher volume of move-ins and gain in occupancy, we were also able to capture solid pricing performance with renewal pricing up 6.5% over the prior year and new lease pricing increasing 3.8%. 
 The higher number of move-ins in the quarter did create some turn-related expense pressure with unit get-ready expenses up 11%, representing the largest percentage increase item in our same-store operating expenses. We expect to see this expense performance moderate somewhat over the remainder of the year as the year-over-year increase in occupancy will likely not be as large as what was captured in Q1. 
 As expected, during this phase of the cycle, our Large Markets segment of the portfolio has picked up stronger pricing momentum when compared to our Secondary Markets segment. Our Large Markets segment performance has benefited largely from our Texas markets of Dallas, Houston and Austin. We expect to see continued strong pricing momentum this year from our Texas markets. Jacksonville is a market that continues to lag within our Large market group. But with minimal new supply pressure on the horizon, we expect to see some improvement build over the course of this year and into next year in Jacksonville. 
 The transaction market remains active, and we're looking at a lot of opportunities at the moment. As noted in last quarter's call, we are seeing more investment capital chasing deals in our markets, and cap rates have clearly come down. 
 Throughout last year, we were able to tie up a number of deals in the 6-cap range. It seems that the market now is running closer to 5.5% range this year for high-end properties with some transactions closing at cap rates closer to 5%. A lot of equity capital looking for better yields and an outlook for continued low interest rates is likely to put more downward pressure on cap rates, and it's hard to see cap rates moving up anytime soon in our markets. 
 Our new development projects are coming online, as expected, with initial leasing in both Little Rock and Nashville running slightly ahead of our forecast. Our project in Charlotte is well under way, and we expect the delivery of initial units in the fourth quarter. A new development in Charleston has just broken ground, and we expect initial unit delivery there in early 2013. 
 As outlined in our release, we closed the sale of 2 properties in the first quarter. We're currently under way with efforts to sell another 7 of our existing properties. We have one of the deals under contract and expect to have the others under contract in the next 60 days or so. 
 In summary, the operating environment remains very strong, and we're encouraged with the momentum in leasing traffic, new move-ins and the pricing that was captured in the first quarter. While we're just now getting into prime leasing season, we expect continued strong trends and are comfortable with our same-store forecast, calling for same-store NOI growth in the 5% to 6% range. 
 The transaction environment is very active, and we expect to execute at a higher level than we have historically in recycling capital from some of our older properties. We remain committed to our investment disciplines and are optimistic about the ability to capture additional external growth later this year. 
 That's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll turn the call over to Al now. 
Albert M. Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide comments on our earnings performance for the first quarter as well as a few highlights regarding investing and financing activities. 
 FFO for the quarter was $46.4 million, or $1.12 per share, which is $0.03 per share above the midpoint of our prior guidance and, as Eric mentioned, is a record for the company. The majority of this FFO per-share outperformance compared to our forecast was produced by financing and investing activities during the first quarter. 
 Interest expense for the quarter was $0.02 per share better than forecasted primarily due to a more favorable-than-expected execution on the unsecured term loan during the quarter. 
 Acquisition expenses were also about $0.02 per share favorable to expectations for the quarter. A portion of this relates to lower acquisition volume with no deals closing in the first quarter, while the remainder relates to the capitalization of some prior costs for acquisition and development land. 
 When we originally acquired the land tracts for 3 of our current development projects, certain costs, mainly commissions, title and attorney fees, were expensed as acquisition costs. During the first quarter, we determined that the correct treatment was to capitalize these amounts, along with other development costs, so we recorded a onetime adjustment during the first quarter. 
 These 2 favorable items during the first quarter were partially offset by about $0.01 per share of additional dilution related to the equity offering, which occurred earlier than projected in our initial guidance. 
 The same-store portfolio performed in line with expectations during the quarter, producing 4.5% NOI growth over the prior year based on a 4.7% increase in effective rents for the quarter. On a sequential basis, NOI grew 1.9% in the first quarter. 
 Same-store operating expenses for the quarter also grew 4.5% over the prior year with the largest increase coming from repair and maintenance costs primarily due to the higher level of move-ins during the quarter. Strong quarter-ending occupancy, combined with growing leasing traffic, positions same-store portfolio for accelerating revenue and NOI performance over the next 2 quarters of the year. 
 During the first quarter, we sold 2 communities, 1 located in Memphis and the other in Houston, as part of our planned recycling program for the year. We received combined proceeds of $29.8 million for the 2 communities, which represents about a 7% cap rate after deducting a 4% management fee, and $350 per unit in capital reserves. We're currently marketing 7 other communities as part of the full year plans, and we plan to sell $75 million to $120 million for the full year. 
 Construction is progressing well in the 4 communities currently under development, which are projected to cost about $144 million in total. We funded an additional $27 million during the first quarter, bringing the total investment to date to just over $81 million. We received initial units and began lease-up at 2 lease communities during the first quarter, Cool Springs in Nashville and Ridge at Chenal Valley in Little Rock.  A total of 148 units were delivered during the quarter with 176 units already leased. 
 Just after quarter end, we closed on the acquisition of Adalay Bay, a 240-unit community located in Chesapeake, Virginia. 
 During April, we also acquired the remaining 2/3 interest in Legacy at Western Oaks, a 479-unit community located in Austin for one of our joint venture funds. MAA's blended investment is now about 111,000 per unit in Legacy, which we believe positions the community for a strong return over the next few years. 
 On the capital markets side of the business, we executed 2 significant transactions during the first quarter. And as you saw in prior releases, we issued about 2 million shares of common stock through a public offering during the quarter, raising total proceeds of about $120 million, net of underwriter's discounts. This transaction provides the majority of our funding for both development and acquisitions for the current year. 
 During the quarter, we also closed on a 5-year or $150 million unsecured term loan with our bank group with very attractive terms and pricing. The new loan is funded in 3 equal tranches with the interest rate effectively locked at 2.71% for 5 years through the use of interest rate swaps. 
 The proceeds of the new loan will be used to repay additional secured borrowings, further increasing the unencumbered asset pool. At the end of the quarter, 35.9% of our gross assets were unencumbered, and we expect to increase this percentage by the end of the year, which we believe will put us in a very good position to pursue additional credit ratings. 
 Finally, as mentioned in the release, we did update our earnings guidance for the full year. While we are maintaining our operating and investing expectations for the year, we're flowing a favorable impact to the financing transactions through the remainder of the year, which increases our FFO per share guidance by $0.03 at the midpoint. 
 A large portion of the acquisition-related favorability in the first quarter is timing in nature and will correct itself over the remainder of the year. However, we do expect additional interest savings from the new loan over the next 3 quarters, partially offset by some additional calls related to the updated financing plans for the year. 
 We now plan to execute an additional financing transaction over the back half of the year to both increase our fixed-rate protection and to further strengthen our balance sheet position as we pursue  investment-grade rating. 
 Our updated FFO guidance for the year is a range of $4.28 to $4.48 per share for the year, which is $4.38 at the midpoint. And that's a 10% increase over the prior year. As a reminder, the key assumptions included in our forecast are a wholly-owned acquisition volume of $250 million to $300 million, disposition volume of $75 million to $125 million and development funding of about $80 million for the year. 
 We also expect our leverage, defined as net debt-to-gross assets, to end the year at about 45% with about 95% of our debt fixed or hedged and with an average interest rate of around 4% for the full year. 
 That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Howard, I'll turn the call over to you for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Mr. David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald. 
David Toti: First question. As we see the cost of capital go lower for the company sort of in lockstep with cap rates on acquisition potential -- potentials, has your underwriting criteria changed at all given that sort of environment over the last couple of quarters? 
H. Bolton: David, this is Eric. To be honest with you, no, it hasn't really changed much. We've -- we continue to look at our cost equity that we -- we define it looking at where our dividend yield is at any given moment in time, which obviously, to some degree, is -- or is affected by our share price. But we go through a process of defining what we expect our shareholders are looking for using the dividend discount model, and then we add the, as we've discussed with many of you in the past, add the -- a premium to that. And so the only -- as our cost of equity changes a little bit, it affects the model a little bit, but not a significant amount. And we continue to have a hurdle rate that's pretty consistent with what we've had for the last year or so. 
Albert M. Campbell: We do put in interest costs into underwriting that's consistent with what we expect to get from the full balance sheet. So over time, as those costs decline, it certainly will be in underwriting as well, David. 
H. Bolton: That's true. Good. 
David Toti: Okay. Well, that's helpful. And then sort of along those lines, how does the company internally weigh or measure how to allocate investment dollars between development versus acquisitions and the CapEx you're spending? There's a pretty wide variety of returns, so I'm just wondering how you guys think internally about those allocations given the spreads. 
H. Bolton: Frankly, our allocation to redevelopment is driven more by just what we feel comfortable executing on. I mean, we look at the opportunity within the portfolio, look at the execution capabilities that we feel like we have and sort of ramp it up commensurate with our ability to get the work done and to obviously achieve the rents that we're looking for. We will push that as aggressively as we feel like we can, particularly in this environment. On the development side of things, frankly, we've spent a lot of time thinking about this with our Board. And with the Charleston deal now under way, that puts us at about $150 million of total capital commitment that is in some stage of development right now. And we're pretty comfortable with that level. We don't expect to see it go up much from that, if at all. We're under way leasing, obviously, in both Nashville and Little Rock, and the lease-ups there are going very well. And if -- we may very well, by the end of this year or early next year, look at getting into another project or 2 as those begin to lease up. But we're pretty comfortable carrying not more than about $150 million of development. And on the acquisition side, our goal for this year is somewhere close to $300 million. It's -- it typically starts out slow, as it is this year. Qs 2 and 3 will pick up. We may do close to $300 million. We may do something less, we may do something more. We just don't know. But that's a number that -- we're going to push it as hard as we can, but we're going to stay committed to the disciplines that we have always used about how we allocate capital in terms of putting out for acquisition. But in terms of just how we allocate between those 3, that's kind of how we think about it. 
David Toti: Okay, that's helpful. And my last question just has to do with the expense growth in the quarter, a little bit higher than most peers, a pretty high number for you guys. Given your current ranges that you've held for the year relative to guidance, does that sort of imply that we'll see considerably lower expense growth rates in the second half and then subsequently potentially stronger NOI results going into the end of the year? 
Albert M. Campbell: Well, I think it certainly implies it, as we expected. Some of those costs per turn that we had in the first quarter will moderate as we move into the back part of the year. And yes, you definitely should see some moderation of overall expenses in the second and third and fourth quarters and coming down to the midpoint of our guidance in the 4% range for the year. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Swaroop Yalla from Morgan Stanley. 
Swaroop Yalla: I was -- I wanted to touch up on the Jacksonville market a little bit, your second largest market. I mean, you're seeing some softness there. Can you comment on whether it's due to job growth-related issues or is it supply or single-family homes threat? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Sure, Swaroop. And this is Tom. Jacksonville was one that is making some strides on its comeback. It's just well behind places like Texas. I mean, it's primarily been driven by weaker job growth. The -- but it is -- it has turned positive. And the signs of encouragement we see in Jacksonville are on the development side. For the past 3 years, they've only seen, on average, 200 units delivered a year for the last 3 years, and that's a market you used to see more than 2,200 a year. And that continues on forward, and we expect job growth to pick up in 2013. So right now, the job -- the units-to-job ratio is about 6.5 to 1, which is really pretty good. Or the -- excuse me, the jobs-to-unit is about 6.5 to 1. That jumps to 13 to 1 in 2013. So we feel like Jacksonville will begin to pick up steam as we go forward. Its full demand has been very good there, in terms of traffic, and we're seeing rents pick up. They're doing about 3.7% on rents, but not as strong as some of our other places. 
Swaroop Yalla: Great. And Eric, you mentioned cap rates of 5.5% in your markets. I'm sorry if I missed this. Is this for the Large Markets or for the blended market? And then maybe if you can comment on the secondary market, what are the cap rate compression you have seen as well? 
H. Bolton: Swaroop, we're -- to be honest with you, we're really not seeing a significant spread between buying in Dallas or buying in Charleston or -- as an example. For the good-quality assets that come to market, the competition is pretty fierce right now. And throughout last year, we were -- as I mentioned, we were able to lock deals down in the 6-cap range, and that would include both Large and Secondary markets. And this year, it's trending closer to 5.5%. And frankly, as I mentioned, we've seen some deals recently close around 5 caps. And that would be in some of these higher-growth, Secondary Markets that we have targeted for acquisition as well, such as Charleston and Savannah, and some of those type of markets. Now we saw a deal recently trade hands in Chattanooga at pricing close to that. So it's just -- I think capital just continues to come into the sector, and they're coming much more active -- becoming much more active in both the Secondary as well as the Large Markets around the Southeast. And I think that we're -- if -- over time, I think it's reasonable to assume something around the 25 to 50 basis-point spread between what you typically see in Secondary versus the Large Markets. But given the asset quality that we're chasing, we're not seeing a whole lot of difference right now. 
Swaroop Yalla: Is that making you pause a little bit in your acquisition underwriting? Or are you thinking that folks are underwriting this correctly with the NOI growth for the next couple of years? 
H. Bolton: Well, I think that it's causing us not to lock up as many deals. That's for sure. I think that we've seen assets trade at pricing that, based on our underwriting, either they're assuming some incredibly heroic assumptions regarding performance over the next 5 to 6 years or the return expectations that they're willing to accept are far lower than what we're willing to accept. So I can't really tell you what they're doing per se. But we feel like that we are pushing as hard as we feel -- as we're comfortable pushing. I think that we've long had a practice of being very disciplined about how we deploy capital. We understand and appreciate that these markets can get supply from time to time. And in this environment, of course, the higher-leverage buyers, the private capital buyers, in this rate environment are able to come in with some fairly aggressive debt and make their numbers work. And so that's what we're kind of running into, and it will change. I think that as we see interest rates move up at some point down the road, I think the dynamics will change. But for us, what we try to continue to do is offer sellers very efficient and effective execution capabilities and certainty -- and the ability to execute a deal for them. And what we typically see is that, that execution capability tends to have more value, frankly. As we get towards the end of the year, people become a little bit nervous about closing on the deals that they'd hoped to get done in a calendar year. So we're going to be patient and stick to our disciplines. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rob Stevenson from Macquarie. 
Robert Stevenson: Can you give a sort of indication what the hard turnover costs are per unit for you guys? And sort of what the -- do you have a ratio as to whatever it is, whatever the right number is, 300 or 500 basis points of turnover, if the impact winds up being on same-store expenses? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Rob, I don't have that ratio. I would tell you it's -- the answer is it's a lot. I mean, the -- what we did was we increased occupancy by 110 basis points, and that's something like 440 units that we turned that we wouldn't -- that we didn't turn last year that we got ready for move-ins. So very significant impact in that. And that's sort of the story of the quarter. And we don't expect -- we ended at 96.2% this quarter, and we don't expect to end next quarter at 97.2%. I mean, this sets us up to just really push rents well a little bit earlier than we had thought. 
Albert M. Campbell: Yes, and what I'll tell you, Rob, I mean, the way we think about the trade-off in terms of sort of forcing turnover versus not, is does the overall turnover level remain acceptable? And we're near our historic lows, so we're comfortable with it. And then we take a hard look at the amount of rent growth we're getting as a result of that forced turnover, and we track it very, very carefully. And we're getting 9% in the first quarter. The rents moved 9% up versus what the old customer was paying that left us because they were upset with the rent increase. And with that -- those kind of dynamics, we're comfortable with what's happening right now. If we saw overall turnover jump up a lot or we weren't getting that level of rent growth from the market as a result of the forced turnover, we'd back off. But, and as Tom said, I mean, in Q1, I mean, the pressure on expenses from repair and maintenance and turn-related activities, that's not going to repeat itself. It can't because we're already so full right now, and we don't think that we're going to force turnover at a higher level than what we saw in the first quarter given that we're just now going into the busy traffic season. With traffic levels running as high as they are, we're pretty confident that we're going to continue to see some pretty strong internal growth and that we think that expenses will come down over the course of the year given where occupancy already is. I would tell you on the hard turn cost that it varies, obviously, to some degree on the unit. But on average, we're going to probably spend somewhere around $700 to $750 a unit. And then if you put the carpet in, it's going to go up a little bit from there. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay. So just in terms of ballpark numbers, $700 or so on 440 units get you to about a little over $300,000 of turnover costs that would have been a drag on you guys this year -- this quarter? 
Albert M. Campbell: Just give you a context, Rob, about a 1% rise in turn costs a year is probably $2.5 million to $3.5 million. And so that's how -- because you guys, you said 1% on 40,000 units in same-store, and you can walk through the math, that's $750 per turn. So for every 1%, rule of thumb is call it $2.5 million to $3.5 million. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then where is property tax? You're a third of the way through the year, where is the conversation on property taxes these days? I mean, is it coming in as expected? Less? Greater? 
H. Bolton: We're getting some very early indications, Rob. We've got a lot of information to go. So we went in the year thinking that was 4% to 5%, 4.5% at midpoint. We don't see anything at this point that tells us that that's not accurate. We need to get a lot more information on the hotspots, which are going to be Texas and Florida. We are getting some early indications from Austin that it's -- that it was going to be about as what we thought. That the increases coming out of there are going to be pretty large and -- which we had planned and put in our numbers, and we're going to obviously fight very aggressively. But we need to get a lot more information on Houston, Dallas and then the Florida markets. So short story is a lot more updates come in the second quarter. But right now, we don't see anything that says we were off the mark. 
Robert Stevenson: All right. And then given your geographical concentration, was there really any benefit to the warmer winter, lack of snow for you guys this quarter? 
H. Bolton: To be honest with you, it may work the other way. The ACs got cranked up a little sooner. And snow removal is not something we tend to think a lot about. But frankly, the warmer spring probably worked more against us than it helped us. 
Robert Stevenson: Well if you keep coming north, that's going to be a increasing problem for you, right? And then just the last question for Tom. Which markets positively, negatively surprised you the most this quarter operationally? 
Thomas L. Grimes: On the surprise side, it's more of the same. Honestly, Rob, there's not much out of the ordinary. on the -- it's Texas rolling on as it has. We were pleased with the improvement in Atlanta. And on the weak side, Jacksonville was about as expected. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. Josh Patinkin from BMO Capital. 
Richard Anderson: It's Rich Anderson here with our new associate, Josh. So I just want to make sure I understood the first quarter. You said that it was in line with expectations except occupancy went up. So what -- can you reconcile that for me? Was it just a trade-off in the first quarter between occupancy and rental rate growth that you initially thought would happen going into the quarter? 
H. Bolton: Well, primarily, in the first quarter -- I'll give you some numbers then I'll let Tom give you the operating facts behind it, Rich. But what you saw is physical occupancy rose, but it -- we didn't get a lot of dollar value from that in the first quarter. That'll come in the second and third quarter. So basically, that's the impact to financial numbers. And Tom can take... 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, if you look at the economic rent, it's reflective of what we would call effective rent, which takes into account that churn of both a little bit more turnover and then the people moving in. We didn't get the benefit of their rent dollar for the full quarter, roughly. But we're sort of excited about what that indicates going forward. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. So did you expect to see the occupancy pop up like it did by the end of the first quarter? Or was that a positive surprise? 
Thomas L. Grimes: That was a positive encouragement. That was the traffic, and first quarter was better than we expected. We were happy to jump all over it, and that was a better thing. 
Richard Anderson: Can you talk about the economics of the new lease growth rate of 3.8%? I mean, I always come back to this, that in a healthy environment, usually the new lease rent growth is greater than the renewals. And that's just not happening anywhere yet, including you guys. So I'm thinking if you're only growing at 3.8% -- not only, it's still very good, of course, but the economics of it, including downtime and having to get the unit back up in sellable order and all that sort of stuff, does that really make sense? I mean, wouldn't you rather maybe pull back a little bit on those people that are leaving because the rent's too great and let them stay just because it's better economically from the standpoint of downtime and the rest? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, and center point. I would point out that the 3.8% is an average for those movements. The people that are leaving us, those were the folks that got 10%, 12%, 13%, 14% increases, and we're backfilling them with somebody that's paying 9% more, not 3.8% more. Does that make sense? 
Richard Anderson: Well, then that does make sense. I guess I'm -- I was looking at the wrong number. Okay. Well, we'll leave it at that. I'll go back through that. Regarding the guidance, you guys are well known for ranges that you can drive a truck through. And I'm curious what it is about the guidance, the quarterly guidance that is creating such a huge range at this point. What are the swing factors, the main swing factors in your mind? You probably said this, but if you could just kind of crystallize it for me. 
Albert M. Campbell: Yes, I mean, Rich, this is Al. We -- first, we did narrow the quarterly a little bit. I think we had a 7% -- $0.07 on each side guidance range at first, and then we narrowed that to $0.05 on each side. And I think the major things that could change are obviously the major drivers of the forecast. It would be operating performance, financing plans and major differences in that. So, I mean, I think it's just us taking account sort of the worst-case scenario to happen and actually the best-case scenario to happen. But if you want to know what we think, it's the midpoint of that range, obviously. 
H. Bolton: I mean, what you'll see is the range will narrow a little bit as the year unfolds. But as Al said, if you want to know what we think, look at the midpoint. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. But, I mean, when you look at some of your peers like -- I'm just looking at Equity Residential, theirs is 65 to 69. I don't know, they have the same forces at work as you do, right?  Just a way of going about business, it's different than your peers. No big deal, I guess. And then the last question is on your comment, Eric, about the Larger Markets picking up and performing better in the first quarter. I'm sorry if I'm mis-remembering this, to use a Roger Clemens term, but isn't that the -- smaller markets have been your leaders, have they not? 
H. Bolton: They have up until recently. 
Richard Anderson: Okay. And what do you think is creating that change? 
H. Bolton: Well, to a large degree, it's been Dallas and Houston. I mean, It's been Texas. But I -- I mean, we fully expect at this stage of the cycle that the Large Market dynamics will support more rent growth, a stronger rent growth, and in aggregate, it -- that, that group of the portfolio will begin to surpass performance of the secondary market. Frankly, we expect it to happen sooner. But our Secondary Market was much more resilient than we expected. And I think that frankly, for the next several quarters, we will see our Large Segment group outperform our Secondary Market segment group. But having said that, I think that the size of the delta in any one given quarter, I don't think you need to -- don't read too much into a given quarter's result. I think over time, what we expect to see is that frankly, our Secondary Market group is likely to begin to show more strength than in -- maybe at some level than our larger group just as a result of the fact that the Secondary Market group is the group that is really not seeing anything at all, really, in the way of supply pressure. And I think that, that group will continue to be more insulated from supply pressure in late 2013 and 2014 than what you may see begin to ramp up in the some of the bigger markets. And recognizing that the Secondary Market group, places like Greenville, South Carolina and Chattanooga and Spartanburg, I mean, they've got some very good job growth dynamics going on. And not to lose sight of the fact that San Antonio is in our small market group, NOI in the first quarter was up 16%. Spartanburg is in our small market group. NOI was up almost 14% in the first quarter. So we've got some strong performances out of that group that I think are going to continue to be pretty good for the next couple of years. I think on average, Dallas and Houston has just been so strong, and Austin, that have really boosted the Large Market group. 
Richard Anderson: I have one more follow-up question, and that's on your -- maybe your closest comp. Colonial was able to achieve investment-grade rating recently from S&P, I believe it was. How does that factor into your thinking about your pursuit of them and Moody's? And do you feel like maybe you got a shot to move a little bit faster up the food chain with that news? 
Albert M. Campbell: That's a good point, Rich. This is Al. I mean, certainly, if you look it -- and we've talked about this in the past. You look at our balance sheet and the metrics, look at the primary metrics that all the agencies look at, whether it's leverage, we look in very good shape compared to Colonial and really all the other peers in the space. Fixed-charge coverage, we're actually the highest in the sector this quarter. Debt-to-EBITDA, I mean, I think they expect something in the multifamily that's little higher, a little over 7. We're 6, 7 in the quarter. And so yes, I think we will point to them, and we'll begin discussion with those guys. And I think the one thing that we talked about that we needed to work on to get there is clearly the malsecured debt and the unencumbered asset pool, and we've made a tremendous amount of progress in both of those over the last couple of quarters really. And so I think they would target -- they would tell you that you would need something about 40% of your portfolio to be unencumbered. They like between 40% and 60%. But 40%, you kind of begin the investment-grade discussions. And so if you look at the quarter, we were at 35.9% at the end of the second -- I mean, the first quarter. And we expect to continue progressing that over the year. So long story short, we're making a lot of progress. And absolutely, we'll point to those guys, we'll point to Essex, who've recently finished out getting their final portion to that. And definitely, we're going to be having discussions for making the case that we believe we're investment grade and hope to persuade those guys and tell them "When you take a close look at the company?" We feel good about where we stand. So yes, I think we will make that point. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. Michael Salinsky from RBC. 
Michael Salinsky: Talk a little bit -- I don't recall if you mentioned it or not. Did you give April trends for the portfolio, where you guys ended up -- ended the month in terms of occupancy and also what you saw in terms of new lease and renewal rents and also where renewals have gone out for May and June? 
H. Bolton: Sure, yes. And I'll just try to run through those.  If I miss one of those questions, pull me back to it. But April was a good month. We saw the new leases were almost 4%. Renewals we got close to 6%. For blended of almost 5%. Renewals are going out in the 7% range, and we're getting mid-6s on them. Occupancy was 96.1s. So essentially, the same place where we ended the quarter. And traffic's -- was exactly where we needed it. Move-ins or move-outs were actually down. Our turnover trend was down 10%. So that's another thing that bodes well for our expense line going forward. 
Michael Salinsky: So that's great detail. Eric, question for you. You talked about acquisition pricing coming down and also, potentially, as you start to lease up, the developments may be adding another 1 or 2. As you think about cap rates at this point, is there -- and you look at development, is there any thought to potentially expanding the development pipeline potentially through joint venture development as a way to grow but also maintain your risk? I mean, maintain your overall exposure? 
H. Bolton: We look at it, Mike, we talk to a number of folks, developers and other capital sources who are always thinking about JV ideas. But I really -- we've obviously got the one JV in place right now that's focused on sort of the value-add play. To be honest with you, I would be reluctant to get into any sort of an extensive JV relationship for purposes of doing new development. I think it just adds increasing complexity to what we're trying to execute on. And I think for us, I mean, the development that we're doing, we feel great about it. It's got -- it's going to be great returns. We feel very comfortable executing at the level that we are. But I -- this is a region of the country that, as you well know, can get supply quicker than most other regions of the country. And we just believe that it's more prudent long term to not try and ramp up a development operation either in-house or on a JV basis. Do it on a selected basis as we're doing it now where we're essentially outsourcing our development to a developer who we just pay a fee for and -- or pay a fee to. And we feel pretty comfortable with that level of execution. I think that by the time we get to 2014, 2015, and presumably supply is coming into the markets at a much more robust pace. I mean, frankly, that's a great opportunity for us to not be in the development business at that time. And we'd much rather have our balance sheet where we're getting it to and be in a position to capitalize on that supply coming into the market that, inevitably, some of it's are going to run into trouble, and it's going to create some great capital deployment opportunities at that time for fairly new product. 
Michael Salinsky: That's helpful. Just staying in terms of the investment. The Austin joint venture buy out there, was that motivated by the -- by your partner? Or was it motivated by MAA? 
H. Bolton: It was our partner who was just, frankly, had  some things they were trying to do with their fund and for their investors and made a decision that they wanted to cycle out of some holdings. And we took a look at that deal. We feel very -- we feel great about Austin. We've got a great presence there. This is a terrific property that we think is going to be a good performer long term. And given the ability of the relationship we had with our partner, we were able to execute a transaction that worked for them and for us. And -- but they really brought it up, and we were glad to work it out the way we did. 
Michael Salinsky: Are you guys marketing any additional fund assets? 
H. Bolton: No, not at the moment. 
Michael Salinsky: Okay. And then final question. Al, it sounds like you guys got disposition activities you could  increase there in the second quarter. Is that earlier than what you had guided to before? And has that any impact in the earnings results relative to your original expectations? 
Albert M. Campbell: Not really, Mike. That's about as we expected. We had -- went into the first of the year with a pretty clear plan, and we've been progressing and pricing and timing. And all that's about what we thought. So no real change there. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Ms. Paula Poskon from Robert Baird. 
Paula Poskon: I apologize if I missed this in your prepared comments, Al. Did you discuss the percentage of move-ups to homeownership? 
Albert M. Campbell: I did not, but Tom has that for you, I think. 
Thomas L. Grimes: So it is -- the percentage of move-ups to home buying for the quarter was 16.5%, which was surprisingly down from last year. Down again. 
Paula Poskon: And Eric, are you still getting the same velocity of inbound calls from private developers looking for capital partners? 
H. Bolton: To be honest with you, it slowed down a little bit because of so many other capital partners that are making themselves available right now, Paula. And, I mean, we still talk to a lot of them, but we're seeing developers having more options going out at this point. So what we find is developers have increasingly more interest in trying to stay involved in the ownership and looking for much more complicated arrangements that we really feel like it's not the right way we want to deploy capital. But, I mean, we're still seeing a lot, but it's not -- I mean, they've got more options at this point. 
Paula Poskon: And just a final question. On previous calls over the last year, you talked about the difference in permitting between your Large and Secondary Markets. Any changes there? Anything that is on your radar screen as a concern that maybe wasn't 6 months ago? 
Albert M. Campbell: Not really, Paula. It's still continue to see most of the permitting activity running higher in the bigger cities, and particularly in Texas. We're seeing some pickup in Florida and in the Carolinas. But the -- there still remains a very clear differentiation between permitting activity between Large and Secondary Markets. The Secondary Markets are not seeing near the pressure at the moment. And I think that that's why -- as I mentioned earlier, I think it bodes well for the Secondary Market group to be more resilient later in the cycle than what's happening right now. Because I think that by the time we get to 2014 and 2015 and you see moderation taking place in the bigger cities because of supply, I think the Secondary Markets will be in a stronger position. 
Thomas L. Grimes: And Paula, just to build on that a little bit, the -- for 2013, taking the permits and sort of converting them over to completions, we -- so the Large Markets, you'll see 9.4 jobs per unit completed, which is pretty darn healthy, but the Secondary Markets are 13 to 1. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Jefferies. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Just 1 quick 1. Eric, I believe you mentioned, or Al, that you were contemplating doing one more capital transaction at the back end of the year to further delever the balance sheet. Is that correct? And what are you possibly contemplating? 
Albert M. Campbell: Omotayo, this is Al. We are contemplating one more transaction not to delever but really to do 2 things. One, to increase our fixed rate protection at the end of the year. So if we have right now about 80%, 89% fixed or hedged, we'll be well over 90% at the end of the year, probably 93% to 95% range. And two; it'll be an unsecured financing of some form. We've moved tactically over the last few quarters with the best products at the right time. So it'll be some form of unsecured financing that allows us to move forward with our plan for investment grade. So it's a debt transaction that we're contemplating to complete our long-term plans. 
Omotayo Okusanya: And how much dilution are you going to factor in into your numbers as a result of that? 
Albert M. Campbell: In the fourth quarter, if you look at -- the real change in guidance for the year -- it's $0.03 for the year. And I know it would -- they say you need to take first quarter and push it through, but that's really not what happened. It's really -- the thing that is causing the full year is interest expense, which is a component of the first quarter, a couple of cents in the first quarter favorable. We have another call it $0.01 in the second quarter and $0.01 in the third quarter from very good execution of that term loan transaction. In the fourth quarter, we'll give up $0.01 to $0.02 in terms of this transaction and -- so that we can fix rates higher and protect our balance sheet and be ready for investment-grade rating. So at the end, that's probably -- if -- for modeling purposes, in essence, I would think of a transaction late this year, $100 million to $200 million in range, probably midpoint of that, call it a financing cost of 4.5% because it will likely be a 10-year-type thing. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. Dave Bragg from Zelman & Associates. 
David Bragg: What was the move-out to rent single-family home rate during the quarter and also first quarter of last year? 
H. Bolton: Move-out to single-family home rental rate was 6 6 last year, and it was 6 5 this year. We still don't see it as a meaningful pressure point, Dave. 
David Bragg: Okay. And then, just, Eric, back to your opening comments, I think you made an interesting connection between move-outs-to-rent increases and move-outs-to-buy. And I think what you said is that you feel more comfortable with the higher move-out-to-rent increase rate today in part because move-outs-to-buy remains so low. So assuming that the move-out-to- buy rate does start to rise at some point in the next several quarters or so, at what point does that cause you to be less aggressive on pushing rents? And can you just talk in general about how you think about the interaction between the 2? 
H. Bolton: Well, our goal, of course, is to be sensitive to the overall turnover level that we see happening. And I think that if turnover begins to pickup associated with people leaving us to buy a home and vacancy loss and the churn costs begin to pick up as a result of that, our tolerance for forcing turnover to a rent increase will moderate at some level. And we will begin to think a little bit differently about how aggressively we're willing to push on the rent increase on a renewal. But for the moment, as I said, we're comfortable with the trade-off for really -- for 2 reasons. We're comfortable with the trade-off in terms of forcing turnover because we're seeing the turnover associated with home buying so low, as you point out. But we're also comfortable with the change, if you will, in the forced turnover because we're getting 9% rent increases, on average, from those folks moving in versus what the people that left us were paying. So with those 2 dynamics, it's pretty strong. I think if move-outs-to-home buying picks up, then we'll have to reconsider that. 
Thomas L. Grimes: But Dave, I would think for move-outs-to-home buying pickup psychology, the situation has to change a bit, and that likely would generate -- that means jobs are back, the economy's rolling, things like that. So we become less dependent on people staying with us and more dependent on new household creation. So the demand dynamic, we would hope and we would think, changes that way where the shift comes. From where our strength has been lower turnover, our strength becomes higher demand. 
David Bragg: Okay. And on that point, given the better job growth across your markets lately, and despite the fact that the move-out-to-buy rate is basically flat, are you getting feedback from the field about improved psychology as it relates to home purchasing? 
Thomas L. Grimes: We are not. And, I mean, Dave, I would have told you last year that move-outs-to-home buying had bottomed last year, and in this quarter, they're out and they're down again. So we're not seeing much about that. The psychology of getting a rent increase definitely hasn't changed. People don't really love that. But the market supports it, and we educate them as to their options as best as we can. 
David Bragg: Okay, that's helpful. And the other question is just on Cool Springs. It looks like the stabilization date has been pushed out a couple of times, and this is despite what looks like a pretty healthy lease-up. So could you talk about that? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, David. Our developer had trouble with the framing contractor, and that delayed us a bit. But because the leasing has gone so well, and because we plan for these things a bit, the yield is intact, and the internal rate of return is intact. The leasing is going extraordinarily well really on both deals but particularly at Cool Springs. We budgeted these to come online with concessions, almost more than 1/2 of a month free per move-in. And we're not offering any concessions, and our base rents are higher than we planned. So slight delay on the construction but not material, and we're excited with the leasing. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. Andrew McCulloch from Green Street. 
Andy McCulloch: In your Secondary Market segment and that kind of "other secondary category," which has, I think, almost 10,000 units in it, can you just talk about that 3% revenue growth in that bucket and just how different the markets in there are performing, I guess? You touched on it briefly, but how wide is the variability in the performance of those markets? 
H. Bolton: Well, it's pretty wide. I can tell you that in that secondary bucket, we -- I mean, places like -- in terms of revenue, year-over-year revenue growth, Chattanooga was 5.3%, Birmingham was almost 6%, Bowling Green, Kentucky was right at 6%, Greenville, South Carolina was 6.6%, Gainesville, Florida was 8.1%. Spartanburg was almost 10%. So obviously, we've got some that are less than that. Warner Robins, Georgia and Macon, Georgia, I don't have those numbers handy. Tom, you may have them. But they're going to be closer to 1% to 2% broadly. 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, and the weaker response were really generated by an increase in turnover. Their occupancies are in reasonably good shape. But you'll see -- at the top of that same page, you'll see the term difference between the Secondary and Large Markets is substantial, and that's what's generated that a bit. 
H. Bolton: One of the markets in that Secondary Market group that pressured us a little bit was Columbus, Georgia where we've -- it's got a high exposure to Fort Benning there. And we had -- some sort of pretty  extensive troop redeployment took place in the first quarter. And resultingly, we had a very high churn take place that pressured the performance in that market. Overall, all of the Secondary Markets were up. It's just some were affected by different factors. And in particular, ones where -- I remember that had a little unique pressure was Columbus, Georgia and, to some degree, the... 
Thomas L. Grimes: San Antonio. 
H. Bolton: Yes, San Antonio. 
Andy McCulloch: Just a big-picture question on the acquisition front. In any given year, can you give us a rough estimate on what percent of deals that you actually underwrite and bid that you will actually close on? 
H. Bolton: Well, I -- just kind of an underwrite, bid, and then there's a best and final and then there's what we actually close on. And I would tell you that what we underwrite and look at, the percent of those that get -- we get into best and final is probably pretty high, 50% to 60%. But, I mean, frankly, in a lot of these markets and the relationships that we have, people kind of generally always want us in the best and final because we're just -- we're kind of a sure thing as they see it. And then it drops off considerably from there. Probably, the best and final, those that we actually wind up closing on, are less than 5%. 
Andy McCulloch: And when you do get out there, the ones that do fall out, what is the delta, generally, between your bid and the winning bidder? 
H. Bolton: 10% to 15%. 
Operator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mr. Buck Horne from Raymond James. 
Buck Horne: A question for you. Are you noticing your rent income ratios in terms of your renters changing at all? And I guess I'm curious. Are you seeing any higher-income residents moving in now? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, I mean, in terms of our portfolio, that point has changed a bit. The rent-to-income ratio has moved from 19%. It sort of peaked in the recession to 16%, which is a bit of an all-time high or all-time low, I guess you can say, an all-time good. The thing that's been interesting to watch a bit is the change in our average incomes, which, last year, average income for the portfolio by unit was $43,000. This year, it's $62,000. 
Buck Horne: And I guess I'm curious about your -- the people that are moving in. What percentage of those, if you know, are first-time renters versus those that may be moving in from another apartment? I mean, are you seeing -- and I guess the question is, are you seeing any benefit from a trade-down of people leaving higher-priced apartments for your apartments? 
Leslie Bratten Cantrell Wolfgang: We are not. 
Operator: I'm showing no additional questions or comments at this time. I'll turn the conference back over to you. 
H. Bolton: Okay. Well, we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. And we will, I'm sure, see you at  [indiscernible]. Thanks. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-02-03 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating in the MAA First Quarter 2012 (sic) [Fourth Quarter 2011] Earnings Conference Call. The company will first share its prepared comments, followed by a question-and-answer session. At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin. 
Leslie Bratten Cantrell Wolfgang: Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations for MAA. With me this morning are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Eric. 
H. Bolton: Thanks, Leslie and, thanks, everyone for joining our call this morning. Our fourth quarter and our full year 2011 FFO per share results were the strongest performances in our company's 18-year history, and we expect continued positive momentum this year with growth in same-store NOI exceeding the results from 2011. At the mid-point of our guidance, we expect to capture over 9% growth in FFO per share this year and deliver another record performance for the company. 
 The demand for apartment housing is likely to remain strong across our markets as the factors driving this demand are going to continue for some time. Employment trends are improving and the outlook for household formation in our Sunbelt markets are forecast to outpace the national trends. Resident turnover remains low, and we don't believe single-family housing, either as a for sale product or a rental product, is likely to have a significant impact on our business for the next couple of years. While there is a growing effort to get new multi-family development going in a number of markets, permitting activity and the forecast that we review suggest that new supply trends in our markets are very manageable, relative to growing demand and we expect continued positive absorption. 
 The develop for balance sheets and sponsors that are able to secure construction financing continue to primarily focus on the coastal market and inner core submarkets that aren't likely to have a meaningful impact on most of our locations. Compared to historic norms, the supply outlook in our Sunbelt markets is still running well below historic norms. 
 So overall, we expect 2012 to be a year of continued strong performance and expect that both same-store NOI and FFO per share, will surpass 2011's record performance. Positive year-over-year leasing trends continue during the fourth quarter and through January. Leasing traffic in the fourth quarter grew 7.2% as compared to a year ago. With continued low resident turnover and strong leasing traffic, pricing momentum remains positive. As compared to the prior year, new lease pricing in the fourth quarter was up 4.5% on top of the very strong 7.4% growth posted last year. Renewal pricing on the same basis grew 5.7%. With the average effective rent turning up in each of our markets across both our Large and Secondary portfolio segments on both a year-over-year and on a sequential quarterly basis, we expect continued solid revenue momentum in 2012. 
 We were pretty active last year with new acquisitions, as well as starting 3 new development projects. We're currently underwriting a number of opportunities since outlined in our 2012 guidance, we expect another busy year of acquisitions. We also noted in our earnings release plans, concerning a new development opportunity in Charleston, South Carolina that we expect to get underway this year. As with our 3 other development projects, we're working with an outside developer, who will oversee the development and construction with our team handling the lease-up. 
 You'll note that in our guidance for 2012, we also plan to step up our capital recycling efforts with plans to sell around $100 million of the existing wholly-owned properties. We're committed to ensuring that we maintain a high-quality and efficiently operating portfolio. At 16 years average age, MAA continues to have one of the younger portfolio's in the sector. So in summary, we're excited about the outlook for 2012 and the opportunity to capture another record year performance for MAA. 
 And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Al for more insights on the quarter end 2012 guidance. 
Albert M. Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide a few comments on earnings performance for the fourth quarter, as well as a few highlights regarding investing and financing activities. 
 FFO for the quarter was $43.1 million or a $1.07 per share, which was a $0.01 ahead of the mid-point of our guidance for the quarter. And earnings performance was driven by same-store portfolio, which produced 4.7% NOI growth over the prior year based on a 4.9% increase in average effective rents. Physical occupancy ended the quarter at a strong 95.2%, 60 basis points below the prior year. 
 Total revenues grew 3.6% during the quarter, while operating expenses grew 2%. Resident turnover remained low at 55.9% at the end of the quarter, with only 17% of move-outs during the quarter related to home buying compared to the historical average of about 24%. 
 Operating performance met expectations for the quarter, while favorability and interest expense produced really the majority of the additional $0.01 per share compared to our forecast. We do have 3 nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter, a gain on the sale of the sale of non-real asset, a loss on debt extinguishment and a charge from fully severance costs, which all essentially net as to have no significant impact on the fourth quarter. 
 Our strong acquisition pace continued during the quarter, as we've purchased 3 new properties for a total of $101 million bringing the full year investment volume to $425 million, including the $25 million of property purchased on behalf of the joint venture and development funding of about $38 million during the year. 
 All 3 property purchased during the quarter were stabilized on acquisition and represented the average cap rate of about 6% on the first years of projected cash flows. During the fourth quarter, we also sold 1 community located in Houston for gross proceeds of $12.9 million. And also as part of our 2011 disposition plans in January, we've closed on the sale of an additional community located in Houston for $22.6 million. These transactions bring total proceeds related to our original disposition plans for the year to about $46.5 million from 3 communities, averaging over 20 years of age and an average cap rate of 6.7%. 
 Progress continues on the 3 communities currently under development, which is still expected to cost about $110 million in total. We funded about $16 million during the fourth quarter and expect initial deliveries and occupancy at 2 of these communities during the first quarter of this year. As mentioned in the release, we are also under contract to acquire the land and develop an additional 270-unit community in Charleston, South California. This community is projected to cost about $32 million and we expect to close on the land parcel and begin the construction in early 2012. 
 We continue to make solid progress to our long-term financing plans and achievement of a full investment grade rate. As you saw on our early releases, during the fourth quarter, we've closed on a new $250 million unsecured credit facility, which has an initial maturity of 4 years and is expendable to $400 million. This new facility provides us the capacity and the flexibility we need to maintain our balance sheet advantage and to fund growth on an unsecured basis. 
 We ended the year with just over 31% of our assets unencumbered. And during 2012, we plan to fund all of our new acquisitions and to refinance about $150 million of our current debt with additional unsecured borrowings, which is expected to increase our earning encumbered asset pool to more than 40% of gross assets by year end. Putting us to what we believe to be in a great position to pursue additional ratings. 
 In order to fund the equity portion of our acquisition and development activity during the fourth quarter, we raised $65 million in net proceeds by issuing $1.1 million new common shares and average price of $58.68 per share. We ended the fourth quarter with our leverage to find us net-debt-to-gross assets of about 46%, while our EBITDA for the quarter covered the fixed charges 3.8x. 
 And then finally, we provided initial guidance for 2012 in our release. Our full-year guidances for FFO are $4.25 per share to $4.45 per share, which is $4.35 at the midpoint, more than a 9% growth over 2011. Our estimate includes full-year same-store NOI growth of 5% to 6% based on revenue growth of 4.5% to 5.5%, and operating expense growth of 3.5% to 4.5%. And a large portion of the expenses growth in 2012 is expected to come from real estate taxes, which is about a quarter for overall operating expenses and they are expected to grow between 4% and 5% in 2012. 
 Other key assumptions include our projected acquisition volume of $300 million, disposition volume of $100 million and development funding of about $80 million for the year. We expect our leverage to range between 45% and 48% during 2012, ending the year near the bottom portion of that range, while we expect our total average interest rate to be about 4% for the year. We anticipate property management expenses of about $21.5 million and G&A expenses of about $15 million in 2012 combined to a total of around $36.5 million for the full year. The projected decline in G&A's is primarily related to the $1.8 million noncash charge and other one-time charges effective 2011. 
 That's all we that have in the way of prepared comments. Amy, I'll turn the call over to you for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Toti of Cantor Fitzgerald. 
David Toti: Two questions. Eric, the first one is for you and it has to do with performance divergence between revenues in the Large and Secondary Markets. Are you seeing that gap widen or contract at all? It seems from the last couple of quarters that the gap is increasing from what we're seeing. Could you give us a little bit of color in terms of that trajectory? 
H. Bolton: Well I do think that the -- we're going to -- as noted, the large segment -- the Large Market segment portfolio revenue growth surpassed the Secondary segment this quarter. And we have been thinking for some time that was going to occur since recovery cycle got underway. And I expect that we will continue to see that relationship with the Large group outperforming the Secondary Market. However, I don't think the gap is going to continue to gap out, if you will, and get bigger. I think that what we're seeing -- impact, our Large Market segment is obviously the Houston market, particularly, Dallas and -- or the Texas markets. Dallas and Houston have been very good. I think that what we're going to see in the secondary market, the Little Rock, the Charleston, Chattanooga, Savannah, some of these markets are actually showing some very good performance. And we think, based on what we're seeing, particularly on the supply side, it's the bigger markets that getting some of those supply pressures. They're starting to show evidence of developers that are gearing up, and these secondary markets continue to show very little in the way of permitting activity. So with -- what we think, it's going to be continued good job growth and very little on the way of supply pressure, we think these Secondary Markets are actually going to be very resilient during the sub-cycle as compared to Large segment. I don't think the gap was going to be that great. 
David Toti: Okay, that's very helpful. And then Al, a question for you. Can you just give us an update in terms of what progress you're making towards the fully -- the full rating, the full unsecured rating? What metrics are you really aiming for? And how close are you to those?
 Dave, that's a great question. We've talked about it for long a time. If you look at our balance sheet, our metrics, we feel like that we are very good shape and compared very favorably both to what rating industries typically require and to many of our rater peers already. With the one exception that the area of work that we knew we had was in the unencumbered asset pool. And just giving idea what they typically focus on, you're talking about fixed charge coverage. I think, typically, they want companies to be greater than 2x, where we ended the quarter 3.8x. Leverage, I think, looking at gross assets ranging, for company like ours, below 50%. We're below that and we're 46% at the end of the quarter, and I think debt to EBITDA is typically another one. And company -- multi-family company, I think, something less than 8% is what they look for. Typically now, we're at 7.5%. So obviously, the major metrics, we stack up very well. And on the encumbered portfolio, we made a lot of progress this year. We began the year with less than 15% unencumbered and we ended the year with more than 30%. And so we expect the end of 2012 with more than 40% encumbered putting us, what we think, into be a really good position. And so we plan on having some pretty good conversations this year with agencies and to make some good progress, Dave. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Swaroop Yalla of Morgan Stanley. 
Swaroop Yalla: I know we have discussed this in the past calls, but I just wanted to, once again ask about what you're seeing for the total move-outs to homes, both buying and sort of renting single-family homes? And how that probably compares with the trough you saw in the cycle, also, just seeing this elevated in certain markets? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Okay. Swaroop, it's Tom, and I'll take that. On the home buying side, I would say, it doesn't -- it compares about the same in terms of a trough, if you will, as we're still in the bottom of the trough. So it's been kind of flat. It's 17% of total move-outs for us on buying house. Home buying or home renting over the time has increased. It used to be about 3% of our total move-outs, if you go back to 2007. It's moved up to 5% of total move-outs now. It's moved up but it hasn't been a material impact. And if you look at -- our highest markets, if you will, would be where you would expect them to be in a place like Jacksonville, and that's moved from -- it used to be about 5% and now it's about 8%. So it doesn't -- neither of those continue -- neither of those appear to be short-term threats. 
H. Bolton: Swaroop, I would just add that I know a lot -- I get to asked a lot about the threat of single-family product, either as for sale or rental product. And we just continue to see, as Tom outlined, we just continue to see low evidence that, that single-family product is a meaningful threat this up cycle that we are in. And despite some of the efforts underway to get investors to come in and start buying up some of these vacant inventory and look at ways of trying to start renting out this single-family product. We discontinue for the renter, that profile that we cater to and the product that we offer. We don't think that the single-family product is going to become a meaningful competitor to us. People want the lifestyle of the communities that we offer and when you look at the demographics of -- I think what happens is a lot the people that lost homes become renters of homes. And I think for the age bracket 20 to 35 that we really tend to focus on, I just don't think the single-family product is going to be a meaningful competing product to -- on a rental basis. And then for sale basis, as long as the mortgage financing stays disciplined and there's no clear real clear evidence that single-family house prices are starting to rapidly move up, I think that people are going to be reluctant to pull the trigger and go out and start buying houses in a big way for quite some time. 
Swaroop Yalla: That's helpful, Eric. Just attending on to expenses. Last year, I think your guidance was also for about a similar kind of expense growth, 3.5% to 4.5%. But you came in well below that. I'm wondering what was the drivers for that? And if we could see something which is favorable this year as well? 
Albert M. Campbell: Swaroop, this is Al. I can give you some color on that. We did have something similar in last year. What happened was, in the latter part -- latter portions of the year, we did have some favorable set appeals from our real estate tax, that came in, helped us in the third and even in the fourth quarter. And I think our utility costs were a little more favorable in the fourth quarter than we're expecting. So I think moving towards the end of the year, we had -- we were at the bottom in our forecast of our expense range that we put out at the beginning of the year. In the fourth quarter, we had some of those favorable bonds that pushes really excellent below the bottom of that range, I think, for the fourth quarter performance, full year performance. So in terms of looking at next year, the pressure items are up fairly similar. We talked about real estate tax -- really 2 areas when you look at that, real estate taxes and utilities. And utilities I'll add the cable program in there because that's considered utility. And those 2 together are about 50% of our expense rise this year. For us, in taxes, the pressure is going to come from 2 main states, I mean, Texas and Florida. And incomes are rising. They tend to be aggressive in those areas and so we do expect some pressure there. Certainly, we're going to work very hard to challenge that, and hope to see some favorability there. But that's what we believe will be at this point. In utilities, we put in what we think best for water cost and cable contracts, and we think that's the right number right now. 
H. Bolton: Swaroop, Again just to recap what Al said. I mean, over 50% of our growth in the expenses in 2012 is associated with just those 2 line items, utilities and taxes. And sitting here today, I mean, we don't know. We won't know for sure what's going to happen on taxes until we get towards the third and early fourth quarter. But given what's going on in such a positive way in terms of apartment values and apartment fundamentals, we have a forecast. But for both utilities and taxes of 4.5% growth in 2012 of over 2011, and we think that's reasonable to go out on that basis and expect that kind of increase in our guidance. I hope we'll do better. But -- and we're going to certainly do all we can to make sure we do better. But that's our best guess at this point. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Robin (sic) [Robert] Stevenson of Macquarie. 
Robert Stevenson: Eric, you talked about 5.7% on renewals in the fourth quarter. What is that in, thus far, from what you sent out for the first quarter, for the first couple of months of the year? 
H. Bolton: Well, I can tell you that our renewal pricing in January is up 6.7%. And the renewals that we've done so far in February and March are running higher than that. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay. So I mean, the momentum really does -- it looks like it's even picking up or is it just still relatively low amount of the leases in February and March and that have comeback at this point? 
H. Bolton: It's still a little early for March. I mean, we're pretty well into February, obviously, right now. But the point is the renewal pricing that we got in --  of the fourth quarter year-over-year was up 5.7%. And what we're seeing in January and February and March, thus far, is ahead of that. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then, when you take a look at your main markets, I mean, what -- which ones are you expecting the most growth out of in 2012, one or two markets? And then one, what are 1 or 2 markets that are sort of on your watch list that you hope does better than what you think, but are going to wind up if rank -- force rank them, would sort of be at the bottom of the rank? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Sure. The ones that have been going is where job growth is just sort of caught. So Dallas, Houston and Austin, Raleigh, all we feel we're very encouraged by the trends that those are showing up in this quarter's numbers and we expect them to continue. On the ones that we're optimistic about, but not quite as optimistic, are places like Atlanta and Jacksonville, where we've seen some recovery, we've seen some nice rent growth beginning there. But the job creation has -- the job creation engines in there's just have been a little slower than the Texas or North Carolina stop. So those would be our little slower community -- or excuse me, markets, if you will, but those are places the developers are staying out of right now too. So it just takes a little bit to get going in both our forecast for about a 1.5% job growth next year. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then, the sort of last question. When you think about the transaction markets across all the markets that you're actively involved in today, I mean, which markets do you feel that you could find ample amount of similar products as your own at north of the 6% cap rate today after CapEx? 
H. Bolton: Well, yes, I mean we continue to look in a lot of the existing markets. So we're in Dallas and Austin is getting a little pricey, to be honest with you. It would be probably hard to find the quality there that we'd like at that kind of cap rate pricing. But we're looking at some opportunities currently in -- along the mid-Atlantic area in Virginia, where we've been doing more and we've got some things there tee'd up that we're hopeful we'll get on the contract that would be in that price range. And then we continue to be very much committed to -- continue to look for opportunities in some of the Secondary Market segment, Charleston, Savannah. Most of -- all these Secondary Markets, we feel like that somewhere between 5.75%  to 6.25% is still pretty achievable. Having said that, I will tell you that we are seeing more capital coming into these markets. So I mean, I think the pricing environment, even in the Secondary Markets, is starting to get a little bit more faulty than it was last year. And I think that the folks are just getting tired of paying forecast of some of this coastal markets and I think they're starting to come into some of these Sunbelt markets and in some Secondary Markets. And so for us, it continues to be a challenge to use our relationships, use our market knowledge and use our execution capability in terms of how we perform for sellers to capture the deals that we feel good about. At pricing, we feel good about and hopefully, get the growth that we've outlined in our guidance for the year. 
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then just one quick one for Al. The additional disclosure on the same-store with bulk-cable netted, it goes away next quarter, right? 
Albert M. Campbell: I'm happy to announce that's going to be going. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Market. 
Richard Anderson: I'm going to ask the stupid question first. Why is your fixed charge coverage ratio greater than your interest coverage ratio? 
Albert M. Campbell: I guess you're -- debt service coverage ratio, I think, is what you're talking about because it includes amortization of that debt service. For us -- typically, it's not that way. But for us, most of our debt is not amortizing. I mean, so when you look at our fixed charge coverage, we have no preferred and so you can walk through that. 
Richard Anderson: Got it. Eric, you talked about supply enough being issue for 2012. And -- but it didn't really get the sense that you were speaking about out years, I know you're not providing guidance for '13 and '14. But what would you say, you guys are doing assuming supply will come online sooner in your markets versus some of the other northern markets. Do you guys have a plan at work now to be prepared for what will inevitably be some supply pressure in your markets? 
H. Bolton: Well, what I would say is the best thing we can do to prepare for 2014 is not build up a big development pipeline right now ourselves. So to be honest with you, it's probably the most important thing that we're doing right now is we continue to be very tentative about committing to new development ourselves. I mentioned that Charleston opportunity that we're going to get going on this next year. We don't have anything else teed up at the moment and in the way of new development, and I would be very cautious about doing so at this point. Having said that, the other thing, frankly, that we're looking to do to prepare for that environment is being sure that we're getting our balance sheet and our capacity to grow as strong as we can get it. Because in one sense, as an owner of a bunch of assets, you always worry about new development coming in, in a bigger way. But as someone who has a balance sheet and a platform that we'd like to see continue to grow in a healthy way, I think that it provides opportunity and that's our whole model, is primarily being an opportunistic or value investor and looking for opportunity as the merchant builders get cranked up and looking for opportunity to put capital out on a real advantageous basis. And so a little supply and more supply probably creates more opportunity for us in that regard. And the beyond that, of course, is just making sure that we have our operating platform, as finally tuned as we can. And be sure that as we face competition from lease-up properties, that we've got our people and our processes teed up, so that we can be very competitive in those environments. So we think that -- we know how to do this. We've been doing this in this region for 18 years, and so we know how to operate and compete against supply pressure when it does come in some of our markets. 
Richard Anderson: What's the reason to you even do -- or what does one new development really get you? I mean, if you're saying that you're hesitant about new development, why even better with one? Is it really going to move the needle? 
H. Bolton: Well, it's like any other, why buy one property? I mean, it's -- we found a very unique situation in a sub market of Charleston Mount Pleasant that's got great downtown access. It's a great area. We're going to invest $32 million. It's $118,000 -- that works out about $118,000 a unit. You put a 6 cap on that, which I know, this submarket in Charleston would command for this quality of product. You put a 6 cap on the first year stabilization and our investment basis of $118,000 a unit goes to $154,000 a unit. So we see it as a tremendous investment opportunity for $32 million worth of our shareholder capital. So it's the same basis that compels us to go out and buy properties. This is -- and important to note, we're not staffing up. We're not adding $1 of overhead to do this. And I think that that's the model that we continue to believe in. Although, I wouldn't -- I'd be a little bit reluctant to do right now. It would take a very unique situation that we could underwrite very comfortably to commit to delivering a bunch of units in 2014. I just -- I think that if we found an opportunity that really is very compelling like this deal in Charleston, we might do one. But it would have to underwrite very, very conservatively. 
Richard Anderson: And then on the investment grade rating process, I guess, it seems to me that the conversation about Fannie and Freddie exiting the multi-family lending business is kind of like off the table now. Would you say you are -- when you got started, that was the primary focus, to kind of become less tethered to Fannie and Freddie, if I remember it correctly. Would you say your motivation to get investment grade rated is even stronger today? Despite the fact that all signs are pointing at Fannie and Freddie maintaining a very significant role in the multi-family business? 
Albert M. Campbell: Rich, this is Al. I would say it's the same. Because our goal all along has really been about balance in our capital structure. And we love our relationships with both Fannie and Freddie. They're very good contracts and they will likely be part of our business for a long time. And I agree with you, they sort of -- some of the risks are going away and their business are some of the thought processes. So I would say, what we're doing right now is aggressively trying to get into a balanced position, where we'll get our investment grade at one point in time, have about 1/2 of our debts secured, 1/2 our debts unsecured. And we would expect both Fannie and Freddie, if they're still a strong part of business, be a part of that secured portion. Along with other people, life companies, commercial banks, some secured and then certainly on unsecured public bonds and larger credit facilities and those things. So the goal for us was to have multiple sources instead of being so focused on 1 or 2 sources of loan, when we think that's obviously the best choice for our company and to provide the growth because we're looking to put up some significant growth in the next few year, and that's the best way to support that. 
Richard Anderson: So when I look at the metrics that you're targeting for the end of the year, I mean, it looks pretty good in terms of having a deeper conversation with the other rating agencies. Would you say though that you might be held to a higher standard because of the nature of your markets? Do you think that, that plays a role and that you probably have a bigger hurdle to jump than some of your other peers? 
H. Bolton: I would say almost the opposite, Rich. If you look at the stability of our cash flow over the last 5 to 7 years, it's one of the more stable cash flows in the sector. And so we don't think that we need to apologize to anybody for our markets. We think that they produce the kind of performance that matches up very well for either a creditor or for a shareholder looking to have a secure, steady growing dividend. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird. 
Paula Poskon: Eric, what's your strategy for increasing the disposition volume? Is it a function of the spread in cap rates between asset quality? Is it the assets themselves, the age CapEx required? Is it the market or submarket dynamics? Is there a particular theme in the strategy there and how you're identifying assets? And why now? 
H. Bolton: Well, what I would say is that, first and foremost, our objective is to ensure that our portfolio of investments are generating the best margin, overall margin of performance that we can get -- operating margin that we can get. And we think that one of the things in this region, the country that's important in terms of driving continued improvement in your operating margin is continuing to cycle out of investments that, either due to CapEx requirements or due to changing neighborhood issues or whatever the issue may be, that would suggest that revenue growth and our ultimate overall, cash flow results, margins are going to have peaked out and that we could redeploy that capital into something more attractive. And so the objective is just to continue to ensure that 5 years from now, we've got a portfolio of investments that is operating with the highest operating margin we can capture in order to be where we want to be 5 years from now. We have to take actions today. And having said that, we've gotten to a point now with our -- as some of the metrics that Al mentioned in terms of balance sheet coverage ratios and earnings coverage and dividend coverage, that frankly, we can afford to be a little bit more active in our recycling effort than we've been in the past. And I think that, obviously, the market is pretty good right now. There's a lot of capital looking for good investments. And as I mentioned a moment ago, a lot of these capitals is coming into our region and some of these secondary markets in a more active way. And so we just see this as a window of opportunity to start to cycle a little bit more aggressively than we have been in the past. And we think that by doing so, that we buy ourselves some good performance down the road. 
Paula Poskon: Okay, great. And I know we talked a lot about the potential of -- or like thereof[ph] of move-outs to home ownership. What about trends and move-outs to rent increases? What are you seeing there? Is it worsening? Are you able to backfill with higher-quality tenants? Can you just kind of clarify what's going on there? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Yes, I would say it's improving on the worsening standpoint, if that makes any sense. It's up by about 200 of folks. They're up about 9%, but it's a very calculated move-up and it's running at about -- less than or about 1 person per property per month moves out for rent increase. And we're back filling. The average for the year was like 11% or 12% rent increase on that. So it is -- we're definitely getting more active in our willingness to push our residents and actually force some level of turnover. We believe some is healthy and good. We don't think we're passed that threshold, but it is up and it's intentionally up. 
Paula Poskon: And then longer-term, how do you think about what your rent-to-income ratios could ceiling at in your markets? And if the current rate of growth were to continue, how long would it take to hit that ceiling? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Well, if all thing remains the same right now, we'll never it that ceiling. Because essentially, what it was is about 18% pre-recession, if you will, in that 18% rent-to-income ratio. And then it went -- it moved up to about 19.5% in peak period. It has since dropped substantially the last 2 years in a row and is now 16.4%. So in other words, our affordability is getting better and better even as our rents go up and up because we're, I assume, reloading with a better level of clientele. So if the current trend continues, it never hits it. Where that bottoms out and starts turning the other way, where affordability really gets constrained, I'm not sure yet. We haven't seen that happen. 
Paula Poskon: Does that imply a possibility of stronger-than-expected rental rate pricing power? 
H. Bolton: It is -- it implies that affordability won't be a factor in that. I think that really comes down to what's the job growth and what's the supply level. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky of RBC capital. 
Michael Salinsky: Al, first question for you, just on the guidance. How much -- because you talked about the elevated acquisition activity for the year. How much ATM issuance have you assumed? Is that kind of a built-in to the guidance already? 
Albert M. Campbell: Yes. I think if you take a look the acquisition, $300 million acquisitions, $100 million dispositions, $80 million development funding, throw in $15 million to $20 million equity funding for joint venture acquisitions. You're going to back into a need, somewhere, $150 million to $200 million, Mike. And we still don't have a ATM program in place. We have about 1.7 million shares remaining. It will certainly look to keep one in place, and look at the other alternatives as well, but that's the need and well, we'll give you more on execution as the year progresses. 
Michael Salinsky: Okay. It's helpful. In the guidance, also, for 2012, can you give us a sense of what you guys are thinking in terms of occupancy. Also, what kind of renewal growth you've built in? Whether you're see that trending a little bit lower as the year progresses? And also what your kind of expectations are for new lease increases in 2012? 
Albert M. Campbell: Well, I'll just tell you what the revenue performance is based on largely, Mike, it's really about pricing next year. We've assumed that the year 2012 is going to look a lot like 2011 in terms of the trends. We expect prices, in total, combined new leases or renewals to go between 5% and 6%. And we put, to your point of occupancy, we believe occupancy will be pretty stable, and it'd be where it is right now, through the year with some seasonal impacts. And maybe the second and third, a little stronger on the quarters. But I think what we have dialed in is a little bit of dollar vacancy loss increase, as we expect to have a little more churn during the month and during the quarter, as turnover picks up a little bit. Because as Tom mentioned, we're going to be pushing on price year and so it will be a little bit -- call that 20, 30 basis points of occupancy. And so that gives you the foundation of what we're seeing for revenue growth next year. 
Michael Salinsky: That's helpful. A couple of -- did you get -- give the new lease rates for the fourth quarter? 
Albert M. Campbell: New lease rates for the fourth quarter? On a year-over-year basis, for the fourth quarter, they're up 4.5%. 
Michael Salinsky: Okay. That's lease-over-lease or was that year-to-date? 
H. Bolton: That's year-over-year. 
Michael Salinsky: Okay. So that make sense. You talked on the last call a little bit about potentially harvesting an asset or two from -- when your joint venture fund is there. Is that still on the table for 2012? 
H. Bolton: We're looking at it, Mike, with our JV partner and sort of reassessing that. We may -- initially, we got the sense that there was a high level of interest from our partner in doing that and actually, selling them. But frankly, certainly, the values have moved up significantly and we're, maybe, also looking at considering just for refinancing and pulling some proceeds out on that -- under that method as well. So we don't have a specific disposition target right now for those assets I mentioned, but we are looking at it. 
Michael Salinsky: Okay. That's helpful. Next question, in terms of performance, if you look at some of newer product in the portfolio versus some of the older, maybe call it, class A versus class B, are you seeing any noticeable trend favors either/or? Or you're getting consistent rent growth across both... 
Thomas L. Grimes: Mike, the real variance there is market and submarket. We've got older assets that are just killing it in places like Austin. And it really has to do more with the location in the broader markets than age. 
Michael Salinsky: Okay. And I realized, you guys -- the final question, I realized, you guys have stepped up your disposition activity for 2012. Just curious, just given the the comments about the frothiness of investors looking for product in that market. Why not sell a bit more and use a little less ATM issuance at this point given where pricing is? 
H. Bolton: Well, we may very well do that, Mike. We've put our guidance out built on those assumptions about we've put there. But I can tell you, if we see the opportunity to move a little faster and do more on disposition side that makes sense, we'll do it. And I think that we're seeing more and growing evidence that investors have an interest more and more in some of these markets. And so we may very well do more than the $100 million that we've assumed. As pointed out, I mean, that's the pretty significant step up -- twice from where it was last year and a lot more than what it was in years past. And so I expect that we'll be at least at that $100 million level. It maybe a little bit more. We'll just see how the year plays out. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Bragg of Zelman & Associates. 
David Bragg: I just wanted to ask you to elaborate a little bit more on how you get to that rent growth outlook for the year that you mentioned? Assuming that -- or knowing that your portfolios are about 1% job growth last year. What's sort of macro environment unrealized outlook for 2012? Is it the same amount of job growth or better? 
Albert M. Campbell: Mike -- I'm sorry. Dave, this is Al. Probably similar to a little better. I think what we're seeing is, in our markets, we're expecting job growth to be a little bit better than last year, but fairly close overall. But it's beginning to pick up a bit. So underlying assumption is a slightly -- a favorable market. So we've assumed that we'll continue to have similar trends as last year. The trends were good in 2011. We expect that to continue, but we're going to continue pushing pricing, and as we talked about, have a little bit of impact on occupancy. So all that rolls together to be, that the performance that we've put in the guidance, 4% to 5% on price, 20% to 30% on vacancy as we give up. 
H. Bolton: I can tell you, Dave, I mean, if you look at U.S -- at least the latest information that we have here talking about job growth stats, nationwide, it's a little over 1%, 1.3%. Our markets is 1.5%. So we do think that the job growth opportunities in our markets are going to surpass the national norms and we hope that does translate into a pretty good growth on new lease pricing. And how we'd think that as we have seen over the last quarter and into January, above 4% on new lease pricing year-over-year. I would expect that we'll continue to see that play out at that level, maybe a little better. And of course, that also pulls up our ability to get that much more aggressive on renewal pricing as well. So anywhere of that 4% to 6% range, I think, for both of them, is perhaps, where we think we'll play out over the course of the year. 
David Bragg: Okay, that's helpful. One other question for you, Eric. Just a follow-up on your comment on the pricing environment getting frothy or more frothy . How do you think that a sustained to low interest rate outlook could impact that going forward? Does it get more frothy from here? And how would you expect that to play out within your markets in terms of that spill over from Core to Secondary? 
H. Bolton: Well, I think that the low-rate environment and the continued strong fundamentals coming out of Apartment business is going continue to attract a lot of capital. And I think that -- there's a lot of evidence that suggests that multi-family business is going to be on a -- compared to other sectors in the commercial real estate area, it's going be pretty darn good for several years. And I think that's just going to continue to bring capital. And as is always the case, when capital starts to come into the sector, we saw it really cause cap rates to fall and values to rise pretty dramatically, in a lot of the the much more favored institutional markets on the coast. And it really began to change, really, in the fourth quarter as we saw some of the larger markets in the Sunbelt, Dallas and elsewhere starting to really see that activity. But we're just trying to see it now markets in some of the Secondary markets as well. And so I think you're going to see some cap rate compression begin to take place between the Secondary and Larger markets. This is certainly over the course of this year. And I think it's a good thing for -- obviously, our values and what I think, market is going to continue to just be very favored in apartments in general. 
David Bragg: So do you expect to see that relative compression. But would you see expect compression in both, on an absolute basis? 
Albert M. Campbell: Yes, absolutely. Both being -- both Large and Secondary Markets, you're talking about? 
David Bragg: Right. 
Albert M. Campbell: Yes, absolutely. You get a really nice asset and a nice location in Charleston, South Carolina or Savannah, Georgia, is getting a lot of interest right now, a whole lot of interest. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew McCulloch of Green Street Advisors. 
Andy McCulloch: You guys saw the year-over-year revenue growth slow fairly materially from 3Q to 4Q. Could you explain what's going on there and what gives you confidence that, that revenue growth will again reaccelerate through 2012 as your guidance suggests? 
Thomas L. Grimes: Oh sure. I mean, that's just sort of the normal seasonality that we see. The main traffic was great in the fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter. But it was down 15% from third quarter. So units sit a little bit longer and occupancy fades a little bit. And we've got the expo -- we were 95-5 [ph] at the end of January, exposure is 8.5%, and I mean, there's just nothing on the horizon that makes us don't think that the seasonal patterns that have fallen through the fourth quarter will pick up again. 
H. Bolton: And Andy, I would add to what Tom said that -- I'll tell you, last year, fourth quarter 2010, we were still very, very focused on occupancy and we were beginning to get a little bit more aggressive on pricing, certainly, at that point. But in the fourth quarter of 2011, we were much more aggressive than we were in 2010 as it relates to renewal, pricing and new lease pricing. So the difference -- because it's obviously Q4, Q4 same seasonal pattern, is just -- we gave up and we we're comfortable giving up, a little bit of -- 60 basis points in occupancy to get the pricing performance that we're getting and believe that, that's the right trade-off to make for the long-term benefit. 
Andy McCulloch: Okay. And then just one question, follow-up on Mike's question on the recent ATM usage. It looks like the average issuance price in 4Q was at or below NAB? Can you talk about the thought process there? Are you continuing issuing equity? 
Albert M. Campbell: Andy, this is Al. Yes, we talked about,  we issued $65 million at about, just somewhere near NAB, maybe slightly below the NAB. And we put that money. 
Andy McCulloch: That's consensus ANB? 
Albert M. Campbell: Yes, that's consensus NAB, put to work immediately. And very high-quality deals where the net present value over the whole period is very accretive, where the cash flow, in terms of FFO is accretive in the first year of ownership. So we certainly think that's a good use of capital. 
Andy McCulloch: Also, and I guess the benefit is helping you do that with the balance sheet as well? 
Albert M. Campbell: Absolutely, there's a little bit of that. There was just not much of it. But if you think about it, $65 million on $101 million of assets, you're pretty close to our leverage, but a little bit of it helped our leverage. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies and Company 
Omotayo Okusanya: Just 2 quick questions. First of all, it's just round out the acquisition and disposition activity. Could you talk a little about what cap rates you expect to make acquisitions at? What cap rates you had just to make dispositions at? And then specifically, for that dispositions, what markets you're looking at to dispose off assets? 
Albert M. Campbell: Acquisition to dispositions, we have... 
Omotayo Okusanya: Cap rates. 
Albert M. Campbell: Oh, cap rates, you're talking about. On  an acquisition, the cap rates, you're talking -- we've been buying deals, Tayo, around 6% and most of the markets are stabilized basis. And we talk about the ones we've disposed off, this year it's 6.7%, on average the trade that we did. So we would consider something like that, as we're going forward, be  pretty reasonable. In terms of our estimates, we probably, in our model, actually have 6% on deals we're buying and 7% on deals we're disposing, something like that. 
H. Bolton: I think we'll do -- hopefully, do better on the disposition than the 7%. Certainly, that's what we've been doing, but that's the way we've modeled it. And then in terms of the markets, we've got a couple of assets in Atlanta. We've got one in Dallas and those are -- the cycling out of some of the product that has either been in the portfolio a good while or we picked up years ago. And we've got a couple of assets, a little bit of an outlier for offset in Cincinnati that we will -- that we're going to move out of as well. 
Omotayo Okusanya: Okay, that's helpful. And then one other question. When I took a look at your earnings growth for 2012 versus '11. It's pretty strong, but basic assumption around dividends is that they're going to stay flat year-over-year. Just kind of curious about that. 
H. Bolton: Well, we look at our dividend with the board once a year. And we -- as you may know, we increased it at our last board meeting on December 1, and set the dividend really for the year. We will look at it again at the end of this year. We don't have any plans to look at it over the course of the year. And so that's really the way we've looked at it. 
Albert M. Campbell: And I'd say, it was a 5.1% growth over the previous year and we upped it in December. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird 
Paula Poskon: Hey, Eric, given the favorable outlook and the positive fundamentals for the whole sector, why do you think the stock is trading at such a huge discount to the peer group? 
H. Bolton: Well, I mean, I think it's -- the discount is obviously in the multiple and then, I mean, there's an applied cap rate difference as well. But Paula, I think it continues to come back to this, I think, belief that our markets, particularly our Secondary markets tend to not be as strong in this particular phase of the cycle relative to the coastal markets and the markets that most of the sectors tends to be heavily invested in. And so it's just a question of expectations for performance over the next year or two. And I think that whether it be organic growth out of same-store NOI or overall FFO performance. And we get that and I understand that perspective. But our thesis is that if you look at our performance historically, our ability to 
 drive internal growth and overall FFO results has been pretty darn competitive with the sector over the long period of time. And it ebbs and flows at different points in the cycle, but on average, it's been pretty close. And I think what the market has to just ask itself is, given the delta or given the difference in terms of implied performance expectation, has reflected in the pricing difference whether it's defined as a multiple or implied cap rate. You're right, the gap is fairly material at this point. The question is are they going to outperform us that much over the next couple of years, or next 3 years or whatever the horizon is. And history would certainly say, that's not the case. I would believe, and I'm pretty confident that, that will be the case going forward. I mean, I certainly believe that we've got the portfolio, we've got the balance sheet and we've got the platform in such a place that we're going to be very competitive in terms of our ability to deliver results over the next year or 2. That will be pretty competitive with the sector. And so we like what we're doing, we like the strategy, we like the focus that we have. And at the end of the day, our focus is just to continue to -- if we can add record earnings again in 2012 over what we did in 2011, which was a record, and just keep making record earnings every year and keep funding a secured growing dividend. I think over time, it all takes care of itself. 
Operator: I'm showing no additional questions at this time Sir. 
H. Bolton: Okay. Well, we appreciate that everyone joining us this morning. And if you got any follow-up calls, you know where to reach us. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for participating in the Mid-America Apartment Communities Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. The company will first share its prepared comments followed by a question and answer session. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Director of External Reporting. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin.
Leslie Wolfgang: Thanks Sean and good morning everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang Director of External Reporting for Mid-America Apartment Communities. With me this morning are Eric Bolton, our CEO, Al Campbell, our CFO, Tom Grimes, Director of Property Management and Drew Taylor, Director of Asset Management. Before we begin, I want to point out that as part of the discussion this morning, company management will make forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-X filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call can be found on our website. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks Leslie and good morning everyone. Mid-America reported better than expected results yesterday, as the operating performance was stronger than we had forecast. The upside was due to better than expected pricing and collections performance as well as lower real estate taxes. In a year that presented significant challenges for the apartment business, Mid-America’s same revenues for all of 2009 declined an average of only 1.2% and NOI declined only 1.5%. For the year, FFO per share grew 1.6% and set an all-time high for our company. As outlined in the beginning of 2009, we expected that Mid-America’s portfolio strategy and financing program, coupled with a strong operating platform, would generate results that would hold out better than most during this tough economic cycle. As we look ahead towards another challenging leasing environment in 2010, we believe Mid-America is well positioned to once again deliver solid results. Our same store forecast for 2010 is of course coming off one of the best performances in the sector for 2009 and thus the benchmark comparison for Mid-America will be tougher than the sector average. Nevertheless, with pricing trends in our portfolio showing early signs of stabilizing and occupancy continuing to hold up well, we remain convinced that a long and strong recovery cycle for Mid-America will emerge late this year. After several quarters of downward pressure on rents, we’re encouraged by early signs suggesting that we've reached a point where we should be able to hold strong occupancy at current pricing levels. On a year-over-year basis, rents on leases written for new residents moving in were down 6.3% for all of 2009 as compared to all of 2008. Over the course of 2009, January to December, new resident rents declined at a slower rate down 3.2% and over the last three months, new resident rents were down only 1%.  This flattening trajectory coupled with the fact that our occupancy has remained very strong and our 90-day exposure, which considers current vacancy plus notices to move out, is lower than we've seen in quite awhile, suggests us that we should begin to capture greater stability in new lease pricing this year at most of our properties. Looking at pricing on leases written for renewal transactions, as you would expect, rent trends were not under quite as much pressure as new resident pricing. Renewal lease pricing declined by 2.8% over the course of 2009 as compared to 3.2% for new resident pricing. However, rent trends for renewing residents will generally lag the trend for new resident rents and thus we expect to see some continued pressure on renewal pricing over the next few months. Given the expectation that the decline in new resident pricing is bottoming out and that overall leasing conditions are set to improve in the second half of this year. We expect that pricing for renewably since we likewise begin to bottom out midyear, and start to recover late this year and into 2011. In summary, with occupancy level high with our 90 day exposure very much under control with employment trends showing signs of stabilizing and with new supply deliveries in most markets continuing to decline. We believe leasing fundamentals will support the start of pricing recovery in the second half of 2010. It's worth noting that according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total job loss incur across Mid-American markets, Mid-American's markets in 2009 was roughly 731,000 jobs. The projection for 2010 is that 126,000 new jobs will be added across our market. The majority of the revenue pressure we expect to see in 2010 is a result of the pricing actions taken during 2009 as we work to the heavy leasing season of the summer, we expect to re-price the book of the portfolio it generally flat, just slightly higher range which will then setup for a stronger recovery in 2011. Taking a look at expectations from our various market concentrations based on employment outlook in new supplied deliveries, we expect continued weakness this year in Atlanta, Jacksonville and Rowley is a limited amount of new supply from project started prior to the credit market pullback come online. Markets have had some weakness over the last few quarters that we believe are beginning to stabilize and/or likely to be somewhat flat in 2010 are Houston, Austin, Charleston, Greenville and Tampa. Markets were expected to capture more stable performance this year as compared to 2009 are Memphis, Dallas and Nashville. As we've discussed in the past, we believe that our portfolio strategy are diversifying capital across the high growth Sunbelt region in both large and select secondary markets with a key attribute to our goal of providing shareholders strong, full cycle performance. As detailed in our earnings release, our secondary market segment continues to deliver a more stable level of performance during this part of the cycle. But as we begin to look towards recovery with nearly 60% of our asset base in the large share market segment that would deliver some of the most robust numbers in the country between now and 2013 and with all these markets expected to see drops in new supply delivery that are well below long established historical delivery rates. We believe the company is in a terrific position to deliver strong results over the next two to three years. We are pleased with the three acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter, which included our initial investments to the San Antonio market. We are also pleased to get another investment into our new joint venture. We believe all three acquisitions would be good long-term investments that will meet or exceed our performance goals. And in each case, we achieved very good pricing as compared to replacement values. A lot has been said concerning the challenges by our states given the limited number of quality properties brought to market thus far with the significant amount of new investment of capital chasing deals. Despite the competitive transaction environment, we believe that we will be successful in capturing a meaningful level of attractive new growth for our shareholders over the next couple of years. We have a long record of strong performance for sellers and brokers in this region and we have generally provided an opportunity to look at most deals. Our strong public read balance sheet provides a competitive advantage in a number of markets where we are competing with private and less well-capitalized buyers. In addition to our normal channels for sourcing deals, we are also working with regional and national lenders to identify situations where we can provide a solution for some of interest less loans that match up with our investment objectives. Our acquisitions focus in 2010 will continue to center on the Sunbelt region with a commitment to both large and select secondary market and our goal of delivering strong full cycle performance for shareholders. That’s all I have in the way of comments. I’ll now turn the call over to Al. Al?
Albert Campbell III: Okay, thank you Eric. Good morning everyone. Our fourth quarter FFO per share $0.92 was $0.05 ahead of the mid-point of our guidance. As Eric mentioned this out performance was driven solid operating results for the quarter with both revenues and expenses contributing to the result. Same store NOI for the fourth quarter was forecasted to decline between 5.5% and 6%, well actual performance was down only 2.6%. Occupancy remain strong during the quarter, while lease pricing, collections and fee income were are all a bit better than projected producing an additional $0.03 per share in revenues. Property operating expenses remained on neutral during the quarter, with real estate tax expense continuing to benefit from successful prior year appeals and favorable assessments producing majority of $0.02 per share favorable to the forecast. Our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have one of the strongest financial positions in the apartment sector. Our fixed charge coverage remains at 8.68 and our leverage at 50% debt-to-gross assets is well below the sector average of 56%. As Eric mentioned we were busy on the acquisition front during the fourth quarter, which led us to issue a small amount of additional equity about $8.2 million under our continuous equity programs to maintain the strength of our balance sheet. As we have discussed in the past, our usage of this program will remain controlled and closely related to the acquisition activity. Our only debt maturity in the year 2010 is our $50 million bank credit facility, which matures in May. Negotiations for this are going well and we expect to close the renewal of this in the first quarter of 2010. We also have a $180 million maturing mid-to-late 2011 and we have begun preliminary discussions on these refinancing. Our current plan to replace these maturities with fixed price agency debt, which easily remains the most available and best option in today's environment. During 2010, we also have $148 million of debt reprising as full interest rate swaps mature at an average rate of 5.7%. Of course that’s outlined in our press release, these are interest rate maturities only not contract, or mortgage maturities and we currently plan to replace these maturities with combination of new interest rate swaps and caps with an average cost of approximately 4.5% to 5% during the first year. These transactions along with the current yield curve support our expectation of continued low interest cost for 2010 which we're projecting to be about 4.2%. At year end just over 81% of our debt was fixed or swapped or capped remaining well protected against the significant raise in interest rates. We've historically maintained around 20% of our debt floating rate or un-hedged but we expect that percentage a bit lower during 2010 as we move to further protect our balance sheet from raising interest rates. Our initial earnings guidance for 2010 which is detailed in the press release is built on continued strong occupancy and a stable lease pricing environment for much of the year. Total revenues for 2010 are projected to continue declining for first couple of quarters as new leases are reprising for the current rent. Expense are projected to remain under control for the year with real estate tax expense nearly a quarter of our operating expenses projects to grow about 4% in 2010 as more rate increases are expected from local governments beginning to deal revenue short falls. As mentioned in our release, the revenues and expenses related to our bulk cable program continue to grow in 2009 and will become more sizable in 2010. Contacts under our former program were essentially fee sharing arrangements whereas under the current program we purchase cable and pass it on to our residents at (inaudible). This new program requires different accounting treatment resulting in revenues and expense pretty gross in separate lines in the P&L and since this new program is ramping up and the financial statement presentation is a change a from our prior program we plan to report same store performance both before and after the new presentation throughout 2010 in order to provide more clarity. As outlined in the release, we expect NOI to decline 6% in 2010 at the mid point of the range. We believe the cumulative two-year decline of 7.5% when combined with 2009 results will compare favorably to the apartment reach sector. We have several property revenue and expense savings initiatives, which contributed to the 2010 same-store performance, many of which began during 2009. These include the bulk cable program, trash and pest fees increase, resident screening and billing improvements and decreased print, advertising cost, which in the total are expected to add about $1.8 million to same-store results. We also expect an additional contribution of between $0.08 and $0.09 per share from our recent development leased up in acquisition pipeline as it continues to mature in 2010. We expect capital expenditures for 2010 on existing property to be near historical levels, somewhere around $770 per unit in total. We also expect an additional $9 million to be invested in our redevelopment program, generating rent increases of around 8%. We have projected $150 million in acquisitions during 2010 for our own balance sheet as well as for Fund II, which we spread fairly evenly throughout next year in our projections. We plan to finance our investment program with the combination of debt and equity funding during the year as necessary in the year with gross assets somewhere in the range of 50%. That concludes our prepared comments Sean, so now we'll turn the line back over to you for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley.
Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley: I was wondering if you can tell us a little bit about the Cap rate differential between costal markets and your markets? And also, what markets are you looking for new acquisitions in 2010?
Eric Bolton Jr.: In terms of differentiation, as far as Cap rates are concerned, when you talk about costal markets, I assume you're referring to the more traditional high barrier costal markets on the West Coast and the North-East markets versus the markets that we’ve operated in the South-East, South-West. And, honestly I don’t know if there has been enough clarity in terms of transaction volume, enough volume to really draw any meaningful conclusion as to where Cap rates and spreads are as sort of settling out. My sense is that - I’ve heard of Cap rates associated with assets in the more traditional high barrier markets, trading in the sub six range. For what we’re seeing in our region of the country, the kind of good quality assets, fairly new assets in the markets that we are perusing investment in, we’re seeing Cap rates in the six range, low six, maybe 6.25 range. But as you may know, I think we may have talked about the past, honestly we don’t spend a lot of time focused on Cap rates and thinking about it. Our focus is really - our decision making is related to how we deploy capital, are all based on internal rate of return and trying to look for ways to create the highest MPV we can for our shareholders. But, I think that there is still - there’s not a lot of transaction volumes when it comes to market - clearly there’s a lot of cap chasing deals. So well located assets, good quality assets are commanding a lot of attention. Now having said that, where we’re finding some of the better buying opportunities, are those that are in some significant level of distress, maybe a brand new property on lease or some other kind of issue like that and of course the going on cap rate on those kind of non-stabilized situations doesn’t make a lot of sense. So, another reason we don’t really spend a lot time on it. In terms of the markets, we continue to like the footprint that we have. We continue to believe that where some of these markets are in the most distressed situation such as the Phoenix and perhaps down in South Florida, where potentially you may see a little bit heavier levels of distress, I think that those may provide some of the best buying opportunities over the coming years. So we will continue to look in those markets. We continue to like the Texas markets in general, Dallas, Houston and Austin. Of course we are now into the San Antonio market. We will be looking to fill out our presence in San Antonio and we continue to like the Carolina region and we would also be looking to potentially move into the Charlotte market at some point if we found the right opportunity there, thus far we haven't.  So no real change in terms of our portfolio strategy of the market focus that we have.
Swaroop Yalla - Morgan Stanley: Another question I have is on the occupancy. I notice that sequentially its down 90 points. Is that seasonal or is that due to the fact that you are now looking at rent increases or stabilizing the new leases?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: Swaroop, hey. It’s Tom. It's seasonal and if there is an anomaly there, it's frankly that it didn’t move down as much as it has in the past years as the fourth quarter is generally a very slow leasing season and we usually see occupancy dip a bit more than it did, and that's one of those things that we take hard and that the fourth quarter would frankly is good as it did for hope knock in and out of the park in 2010 but that's a hope item.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Couple of quick questions here, first on your assumptions of 2010, what's the employment forecast you guys kind of build those on, and also just curious is to what's your assumptions were for LIBOR or relative rate have you bet - have you assumed any kind of increase as the year goes on there?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: Michael, I'll take the first one and let Al take the second one. As far as sort of broad economic assumptions, we generally think that there's not going to be much in a way of employment recovery broadly speaking across the country in 2010 we think that sort of this 10ish type unemployment rate will persist through really most of 2010. As I mentioned, at least according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we are expect to see net job add of roughly 127,000 across our market new jobs in 2010, but broadly speaking we think that kind of this 10% unemployment rate will persist for a while and will see what really drives. I believe that we are if you were bottoming out and potentially start to get some pricing attraction in the last half of the year is not so much function of recovering economy in employment as much as it is, the supply line is absolutely turned off and we got a few projects here and there that are continuing to come online this year that are pressing us. But broadly speaking, it is the lack of new supply in a stabilizing employment market that suggests to us that we are reaching a point of sort of equilibrium as far as absorption goes and thus should be able to stabilize pricing as we stated last part of the year. I do think that hopefully we begin to see the economy really pick up steam in 2011 and the jobs follow next year would be my guess. Al you want to?
Albert Campbell III: I will take the LIBOR question. We did have an increased bill from their forecast and just basically we used the U curve and you know right now it is very steep that the short-term rates remain to be very low. But over the course of the year, they are projecting a sort of rate rise, 50 to 75 basis points or something like that, the last I looked at it. So we basically have bagged that in and I think deeper part of the question maybe we are continuing to hold our interest rate at a very low 4.2% next year like we did in 2009 and that’s really a function of the refinancing. So rate maturity that we have going on. We had the 65 million at the end of last year, where it was 7.7% refinanced at a very low rate and then we will have the 148 that I talked about this year and so a combination of all those things combined with the current U curve rising somewhat over this year hold our rates at a very low 4.2.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: That’s helpful there. The second question, the three purchases during the quarter, I think you disclosed in the one in Tampa before, what were the purchase prices for the one in San Antonio as well as the one in Austin, cap rates on those and what kind of IRRs are underwritten on those?
Eric Bolton Jr.: One in San Antonio, I don’t have the IRR in front of me I will get that for you Mike, but it’s going to be somewhere around 13 to 13.5 kind of range for both of these deals based on the way we underwrote them. As far as the San Antonio deal, we paid $29.8 million for it, so roughly about 75,000 a unit for a brand new property in San Antonio, Texas that I would put replacement value somewhere in the $105,000, maybe $110,000 range. As far as the Legacy at Western Oaks and Austin, Texas we paid $46.5 million for that property putting per unit price at roughly around 97,000 a unit. This has been a terrific location in Austin. The property has done extremely well from a holding up, in terms of this current environment around 95% occupancy at the time we bought that property, but they’ve had back up on pricing a little bit as we all have. And I would put replacement value for this location in Austin probably somewhere around $120,000 range for the quality asset that we bought. Cap rates on these, I’m going to, I don’t know, because frankly we didn’t spend our time on it, but…
Albert Campbell III: They average about 7% for the three deals Mike.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay and that’s on for 012
Albert Campbell III: It is for '12
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Just curious I mean if you are looking at your portfolio versus the market rate now, is there a gain of lease or loss of lease at this point and if so I mean how would you quantify that?
Eric Bolton Jr.: Well, I think that this is going to be a year of transition. I think that what we've going on to and you almost have to sort of, when you look at the in-place leases that we have right now, I think that for the leases that were written in say the last 6 months of 2009 that mature was in next months of 2010 or maybe actually written in early 2009, first three quarters of 2009. I always say there is probably sort of loss to lease if you will that is yet to be recognized and that’s why we forecast that we were going to continue to see some downward pressure on rental rates over the first, call it six to eight months of the year. But I think that, as conditions flat now and by sort of Q3, Q4 of 2010 as we begin to reprise the leases that were written in the last half of 2009, we really think that the gain to lease relationship starts to comeback into the equation. And of course the challenge with all this and way the math works is, it takes a little time and several months and depending on the time of the year where you are leasing and reprising the summer being the busier time where we reprised the bulk of our portfolio, it takes a while for all these trends to really manifest themselves in terms of overall revenue results. But I think, broadly speaking is why we think on the net basis we'll probably see more of lost lease over the first six to eight months, we'll start to see gain to lease building over the last, call it several months of the year and that momentum really carries into 2011 in a pretty strong way. Interesting point though to keep in mind is that in 2009, I think as you think about 2010 versus 2009 and then 2011 beyond that, let me think about the upside inheriting in different portfolios you have to really begin to look at the different pricing or the different revenue variables, and you have to also look how various companies battle through the recession period, if you will, in 2009 and 2010.  In our particular case, of course we really only conceded, if you will, on one variable and that was price. And what we did not concede on is, we did not concede on occupancy, we did not concede on resident quality as evidenced by the very strong collections performance that we had. And we didn't concede on some of these waves that frankly other do, not necessarily in the REIT sector but I have seen it in some cases where in my opinion it makes recovery very difficult. In our case, with the revenue variable being really the only variable that, if you will, we conceded on in a recovering market particularly one that kind of strained the recovery that we’re anticipating where there is really no supply and issue, and we think going to be some of the best job growth prospects in the country. It sets up for a scenario where that particular variable of pricing can be pushed very aggressively and that’s why we believe that Mid-America will actually do very well in this recovery cycle.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sheila McGrath - KBW. 
Sheila McGrath - KBW: On the financing front, have you noticed any change in attitude on new financing from Fannie and Freddie or an increase in interest from other sources of financing?
Albert Campbell III:   Good question Sheila, we have not seen any changes really from the agencies, they’re still there, still very active, still wanting business and are the best option right now in general. We’re seeing a little bit of picked up interest maybe commercial banks, and some other sources but still small compared to the agencies impact right now.
Sheila McGrath - KBW :  Okay, and then Al on the real estate tax increase you did mention 4%, I was just wondering is this from early indications of increases that you're having or is it just your best guess at this point.
Albert Campbell III: We meet with our consultants earlier on and here and really try to the best we can, figure out what we are going to see. You got two things going on there, you got the valuations and the rate increases to consider. And so, we have met with our consultants, we really won't know until the middle of the year on both of those items, but we have made our best projection on those and I think the context is, if you look at 2009, we had very good valuations that came down in a couple of areas with Texas and Florida and the millage rates didn’t - they weren’t increased as one as strong as we had originally thought because the environment just didn’t allow it.  And so, moving into 2010, I think the thought process is valuations will probably be pretty stable, but you will begin to see some millage rate increases as some of these local governments begin to deal with these budget issues and so that is sort of the consensus of our consultants that we have right now and we will give you more clarity in the middle of the year I think.
Sheila McGrath - KBW:  On the acquisitions, should we assume that it is going to be balanced in terms of what goes into the JV and what goes on your own account.
Albert Campbell III:  Yes, Sheila that is our assumptions for our forecast are $150 million for each in 2010. So, in general the answer to your question is yes, it will be generally balanced. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets Corp.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets Corp.:  It is strange not to hear a British voice emanating from them. Anyway, a couple of things that I just need to get some clarification on your prepared remarks. You said you should be able to hold occupancy at current pricing levels and you also said that you will re-price the bulk of your portfolio at flat to slightly higher rents and yet, it is easily understood that rents are still rolling down, which you also said. So, can you kind of reconcile those comments and explain what you meant by those?
Eric Bolton Jr.: I think it really depends on whether you're talking about new leases for new residents or renewal leases for renewing residents. And, I think that that may be part of where the confusion came in. I think on new leases for new residents, what we believe is that we are in a scenario where we are approaching a flattening of the curve and would expect, as I mentioned over the last three months, the rate of decline is 1%, which is significantly down from what we had seen earlier in 2009.  And, I would expect that what we’ll see on new leases is generally, maybe slightly down for the first few months of this year and then it flattens out over the bulk of the summer, where you tend to get a little bit more active leasing season going on. And then hopefully, we’ll begin to see slightly positive movement towards the last half of the year. Renewal transactions tends to lag new resident pricing and unbalance that scenario I’ve just described for you for new resident pricing. You can put a two or three lag on that as relates to renewal resident pricing and I think that that’s what you come up with. And then depending on the percent of your portfolio that’s for new resident versus renewing resident, you kind of roll all of it together and we think on balance, what that tends to generate is probably a slightly overall net down year in terms of pricing. But, we think we’re going to be able to offset some of this with some of these initiatives and other things that we talked about. But, I don’t know if that -
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: So, you said new leases are down 3.2%?
Eric Bolton Jr.: In the comments, I said on a year-over-year - if you look at just the course of 2009, and you look at just the course of 2009 and you look at January versus December they fell about 3.2%.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: And renewals fell by 1.8% in 2009?
Eric Bolton Jr.: 2.8%
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: It fell by 2.8%?
Eric Bolton Jr.:  Correct.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: So that’s just kind of unique relative to your peers and I wonder if it's just a market thing, southeastern kind of market thing because a lot of your peers are seeing renewals up and new leases down much more significantly. Do you have any idea why that would be differing renewals?
Eric Bolton Jr.: I'm going to let Drew articulate the way you have to think about this, Rich. Of course it depends on whether you are talking about year, actual calendar year over calendar year or whether you are talking about more of a trending kind of over the course of the year. So Drew why don't you?
James Andrew Taylor: Rich, there is really two ways to look at it. The first is sort of a lease-over-lease method, which I think is probably how the peers are looking at it. And that’s comparing a new rental rate versus the expiring rate, if you will. The other method, which Eric mentioned in the 2.8%, is if you look at renewal pricing over a period of time and look at a specific time and compare to another specific time, and so if you look at pricing in the lease-over-lease method, if you will, our leases were actually up 90 basis points. We aggressively managed that process. We are always looking to push through an increase if we can. So from that perspective, they were up. But if you look at it over time, which Eric mentioned from January through December, in a declining rate environment, the result is down 2.8%.
Eric Bolton Jr.: And it's that period over period Rich; I think you really have to think about as it relates to your guidance in terms of your earnings forecast.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay, that make sense and I didn’t get that exactly, so thanks for that. So on a lease-over-lease basis what would be your renewals as of the fourth quarter kind of point in time and what would be the new leases percentage assuming that would be a decline?
Albert Campbell III: Yes, the new leases were down 72, the renewals were up 90 basis points as I mentioned in the aggregate we were down 37.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Now, turning to acquisitions, you mentioned in the release that you would fund or finance them with the line in Fannie and Freddie, but you’re kind of eluded to the ATM program in your remarks as well, would you suggest that your $150 million on balance sheet and $150 million to be funded through fund II will be balance sheet neutral, come this time next year or do you think you'll be levering up a little bit?
Albert Campbell III: Our goal is to keep the activity of balance sheet neutral.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay, and say you just, that we could maybe assume some ATM draws as you go thorough out the year, is that it?
Albert Campbell III: Correct Richard.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay and then actually I just e-mailed you just and I just want to make sure I got clarity, you call loss-to-lease, I call it gain-to-lease I don't know if, I think loss-to-lease is an opportunity to roll-up to market, a role-up to market is that just to (inaudible)?
Eric Bolton Jr.: Yes, it is if you go back to the years ago the way you're defining is the right way and I would agree with that.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay, I just want to make sure I had -- on the same page. And then finally on your guidance what you guys did in 2009 was kind of regularly do better than expectations that were set by you and I do have a theory about guidance and will take this with me to my grave if I have to, but the guidance is set by the same companies that seek the guidance. And so I'm not saying your sandbagging, but what I am - and this is true I would say for all reads to some degree that there is an element of conservatism that has to be imparted to make sure you don’t over promise particularly in this environment. So assuming there was a conservative sort of hair cuts for going into 2009, would you say your conservative approach is equally apparent for 2010 or do you feel a little bit more, it’s kind of a less of a necessary component to your guidance?
Eric Bolton Jr.: What I would say is this Rich, is that I think the ability to forecast the various variables at the macro level and the micro level are much better this year than they were in 2009. I think in early 2009, the world was very uncertain and I think that it was necessary and imprudent to be putting guidance out with that recognition in mind. I think 2010, we have a lot more clarity on things and so I will leave it at that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird. 
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: I have a couple of just prospective antidotal questions for you. First just thinking about this, hopefully a period of stabilization, what are you hearing from your tenants. Are they still nervous about losing their jobs, do they have more of a sense of security. What are you hearing from them?
Albert Campbell III: Paula, I mean the way to kind of listen other than just being out onsite is to sort of go through the reasons, what the stability is and those things related to job loss are better now and I think we are sensing just, that’s what Eric said, there was a, I think everybody was scared to death in the beginning of last year and I think we saw that in our residence.
 : But, there are just a little more comfort there on both our side onsite, which are good indicators as well as our residence.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Returning to the acquisition environment, can you just give a little color on what kinds of opportunities that you are seeing in terms of, are you seeing a plethora of what would call attractive opportunities for you or is it more of a needle in the haystack environment?
Albert Campbell III: It’s going to be, honestly more of a needle in the haystack environment from what we are seeing thus far Paula. I think it’s going to be a lot of rifle shot kind of opportunities and I think that we are not seeing anything at this point that would suggest just a lot of product coming to market. I think it’s going to buyer or sellers institutional investors that have various reasons that they need to cycle out of an asset perhaps they've got issues elsewhere in their portfolio and they view the opportunity to sell a multi-family stabilized asset is the better way to monetize value than trying to sell a retail shopping center. So I think that and what they tend to do in those cases they may get, they may or may not get a broker involved, they generally do with that kind of seller and hopefully we can come in and provide based on our relationship we have with the broker and potentially even in some cases the institutional seller and offer them some advantage in terms of timing and certainty of close. We think that in 2010 probably half of the deals we'll get will be off market deals based on relationships and based on track record. The other area of opportunity of course I alluded to is with some of the banks, some of the regional banks that I think reduced it's, that there is some momentum building to begin to address some of those troubled loans in their portfolio. And whereas throughout most of 2009 we were really just seeing the most distress situations which are probably leased-up deals that are just way behind in terms of debt service and way past due on the loan. I think that we're seeing now potentially some of the banks beginning to address deals that are clearly distressed but not perhaps quite the level of distress that we saw in 2009 but more interestingly some of these regional lenders will come to us, we hope and we are trying to see some evidence of it and say, look I've got this deal in Dallas, I've got this deal in Nashville, I've got this deal in Tampa, and I'd like to kind of knock off (inaudible) at one time, which you guys have an interest and I think that that’s the kind of a transaction, where we would be in somewhat of an advantage position relative to some of the other buyers out there.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: That’s helpful, thanks. And conversely, given the capital that’s on the sidelines that’s out looking for opportunities, and we keep hearing that is very much the buyers outnumbering sellers these days, would it not make sense to think about recycling some capital out of your older assets and put those on the market?
Albert Campbell III:   Well, we continue to look at it and I think that from our perspective if - of course we have no real need to cycle capital for purposes of fixing a balance sheet or raising liquidity issues or anything of that nature. And it would strictly just an opportunistic play where we think we can - and we don't really want to change our portfolio market allocation, if you will. We like where we are and we don't really feel that we've got to cycle out certain market to regions from a strategic perspective. So having said that I think that we'll just continue to look at it and if we feel that an opportunity to sell an asset -- of course you have to think about - look at where your current NOI performance is and evaluate whether or not this is the best time to maximize value, given depressed NOI levels are and even though there’s lot of buyer interest out there. So there’s no clear answer on it but I will tell you this, that we continue to look at some of the assets that we think over the next 2 or 3 years that we likely are going to, want to sell and whether, if an opportunity presents itself this year to sell one or two of them, despite we haven’t dialed in any of this into our guidance because we just can't really predict it, but there is nothing, whether it is sold this year or next year, recognizing that we may have a slightly higher NOI level, I think the capital will still be there and the opportunity caps are higher value maybe actually a little bit stronger in some respects depending on the situation next year. So, we will continue to monitor it.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird:  And then just finally to come back to the agencies, what are you hearing from your friends there in terms of any concerns that they have around the saber rattling that is going on the hill right now.
Albert Campbell III:  Good question Paula. We really not hearing anything that different from the recent past and I think the consensus still is in the short-term, a lot of that is politics, politicians are going to do what they do. Nothing in the short term really is going to change because of the impact it would have would just be too great, I think, but the question is, coming forth more is what is going to happen in long term? And I think the truth is no one really knows long term what is going to happen, there is probably going to be some restructuring I think in terms of Mid-America, the important think to remember is, we are watching that very closely and we have long-term contracts that if we needed to make a transition, we can do that in an orderly process. And so, I think what we are hearing from them, nothing really that concerning at this point.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael Levy - Macquarie.
Michael Levy - Macquarie:  I was on and off, can you please remind me whether there was any share issuance embedded in the guidance?
Albert Campbell III:  Michael, the answer was given there that basically, we are going to maintain our balance sheet leverage at where it is right now by 50%. And so, you can back into that if we are going to acquire $150 million for our own balance sheet and $150 million for our joint venture that is about 65% leverage and we take a third of that. You can dial in and figure out what that would be. But we - there would be shared interests to maintain and sport that program and maintain our balance sheets straight.
Michael Levy - Macquarie: And the higher fourth quarter number for this year relative to the third quarter, did you give any commentary as to what’s driving that?
Eric Bolton Jr.: Fourth quarter, you mean in earnings? Or share --? You mean the earnings?
Michael Levy - Macquarie: Earnings, yes. Is that related to the acquisitions?
Eric Bolton Jr.: I can share - I think it’s really two things. It’s really - the good news is, it was essentially operating performance. About (inaudible).
Michael Levy - Macquarie: I’m sorry. The 2010, if I just look at the range that you expect for 2010.
Eric Bolton Jr.: Okay, I think there, what you got Mike, is a combination of a lot of factors. You’ve got the downward trend in revenues that we’ve talked about as we re-price our portfolio in the first couple of quarters, is impacting the first couple of quarters and by the late part of the year, what we’re seeing is, as a small amount of jobs and stability continues in the market pace, there will be a slight bit of improvement in the fourth quarter. So, that’s probably what you’re seeing. That plus, the fourth quarter is typically a very low expense period compare to the third quarter, which you’re coming off of. So, I think it’s those factors coming together.
Operator: Our final question comes from Steve Smith - Morgan Stanley.
Steve Smith - Morgan Stanley: When you look at the expectations for markets to begin to improve later this year, is it the markets that you would characterize as better today, beginning to improve first, is it markets that are weaker coming back, or is it just across your whole portfolio.
Eric Bolton Jr.: I think its markets that have been weak for a longer period of time that are - or they’re just further along in the cycle broadly speaking, I think it’s - with Dallas and Houston as an example, we’re kind of late to the party. Last year and so they are not quite as far along. But they are starting to - so there's some sort of this cycle timing on this. But honestly it also gets to be very much a market specific sort of issue as it relatives to just whether that market happened to get some supply in late 2009. And Tom you want to -?
Thomas Grimes Jr.: That was the point I was going to make really. It's cycle but some those like the larger markets, the Texas markets, they dipped later but they didn’t dip as far. But really what we are sorting through in Houston, in Austin, really has to do more with the supply coming online and the jobs totally imploding as I did in a place like Atlanta. And so as we work through that, we just have the supply issue, the supply in those markets drops off sharply in 2010 and beyond. So there is a little bit of base there. But it is, as Eric said, it's sort of market by market, you've got to balance all those characteristic.
Steve Smith - Morgan Stanley: And then Albert, just one question for you, I'm just trying to reconcile the guidance where you’ve got expected interest cost that are up a little bit from where things are at the start of the year. You expect to I think roll the swaps over at or below the cost you're at today. So just what's the assumption driving up the interest cost? Is it higher variable rate, interest cost, is it the rate on the incremental debt or is it the line rolling over this year?
Albert Campbell III: I think it's going to be the yield curve, the variable rate debt that we projected on the yield curve is expected to increase 50 basis points to 75 basis points from the current level as we move into the year. I think as you look at the refinancing that we've talked about, I mean, you do math on that and all those will contribute savings. But the yield curves rise will bring it up a little bit in total. So 4.2 for the year is combined and really the rising curve impact.
Operator: Your next question comes from Buck Horne - Raymond James Financial Inc.
Buck Horne - Raymond James Financial Inc.: I just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of the single family market and the spring selling season here given the push to use tax credits and low mortgage rates and FHA loans. Is that a factor and how you're thinking about the quarterly progression of your resident move outs or new lease pricing? And I guess secondly have you seen any ambitious homebuilders out there putting flyers out your community just trying to push renters out there?
Albert Campbell III: I haven't seen any ambitious homebuilder in sometime, to be honest with you. And as we think about looking forward we expect the turn overall go up a bit based on home-buying gaming ground overtime but not much, and we really look at that as a sort of a long-term healthy component to the economy, we'd like to see home-buying comeback a little bit. The anomaly in home-buying press this year speaking to the credit and incentives, we saw -- although overall turnover still drop, we saw a home-buying, which had been under 20% of our move out in Q4 bump up to 25% which is moreover we would expect to be the long-term normal rate, we attribute that almost completely to the incentives and the uncertainty that they would be carried forward to the spring season, January home-buying and employment hit back down to 17% of our move out. So I think in our markets, we saw a good bit of the home-buying capable money move out in January, I mean in December with that - or with the fourth quarter with that jump it's 25% but it seems to go right back down to 17 in January. So we will be monitoring and like I said would like to see it pick up modestly over time. We think we will also see decreases and things like job loss as the economy picks up a little that won’t cause turnover to go up massively.
Operator: I’m not showing any further questions at this time gentlemen.
Eric Bolton Jr.: Okay, well, thank you Sean. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and let us know if you have any questions, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect, good day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for participating in the Mid-America Apartment Communities fourth quarter earnings release conference call. The company will first share its prepared comments followed by a question-and-answer session. At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Director of External Reporting. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin.
Leslie Wolfgang: Thank you, [Tyrone], and good morning, everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Director of External Reporting for Mid-America Apartment Communities. With me this morning are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Simon Wadsworth, our CFO; Al Campbell, Treasurer; Tom Grimes, Director of Property Management; and Drew Taylor, Director of Asset Management. Before we begin, I want to point out that as part of the discussion this morning, company management will make forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call can be found on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks, Leslie and good morning everyone. As reported in yesterday’s earning release, Mid-America ended 2008 on a positive note. Despite a challenging marketing environment, funds from operation in the fourth quarter were $0.01 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. For calendar year 2008, FFO per share grew by 5% and importantly was only $0.02 per share below the midpoint of our original guidance. This is worth noting given that our original 2008 guidance issued last February did not contemplate the significant deterioration in leasing fundamentals that occurred over the last few months of the year nor did our original guidances, we had raised a $104 million of new equity during the year. Achieving 5% growth in FFO per share and performing largely in line with our original expectations despite these challenges reflects a number of positive aspects about Mid-America’s strength and stability in portfolio strategy, operating platform, financing strategy, and our approach to deploying capital. These same strengths are what now enable Mid-America to be well positioned for what will obviously be a more challenging operating environment in 2009. As we consider the forecast for 2009, we believe that consistent with the last downturn for apartment fundamentals, Mid-America will weather the weaker leasing cycle better than most. There are several aspects to our earnings platform that enable Mid-America to deliver strong financial results during up cycles and to better weather down cycles without putting the balance sheet risk, without writing off significant asset value and without raising real concern about the dividend. We were able to demonstrate some of these strengths in the challenging fourth quarter just ended and believe they will continue to support our performance in 2009. The first key attribute to our earnings platform is of course our portfolio of strategy. While it's clear that this recession is touching most every employment sector. Mid-America’s diversified market profile also provides the solid diversification across various employment sectors, and avoid significant exposure from job loss from anyone particular industry. And somewhat unique to Mid-America's strategy among the other multifamily REITs is of course our heavier allocation to secondary markets as demonstrated. During the last downturn, and as demonstrated during the fourth quarter, Mid-America’s secondary market segment held up comparatively well. Our portfolio having awarded significant concentration in some of the worse single-family housing markets is we believe going to continue to be a net beneficiary of the long-term correction underway in the single family housing market. We continue to see an overall decline in resident turnover in the fourth quarter, with our largest drop in turnover once again occurring in those move-outs due to home buying. We expect our portfolio strategy focused on the Sunbelt region's higher employment growth and diversified across both primary and more stable secondary markets will demonstrate more resistance to the pressure of the recession and also provide quicker recovery. With the access to new development capital, very, very limited and expected to be so for some time. The supply side of the equation is not going to be a pressure point in most of our markets for at least the next couple of years. Taking a look at our markets and expectations for 2009, we expect that we will see our biggest challenges in Atlanta and Jacksonville. While Phoenix will also be a challenge, we of course only have two properties presently in that market. Markets that we believe will continue to hold up comparatively well are Dallas, Houston, Raleigh and a number of our secondary markets such as Jackson, Little Rock, Tallahassee, and Lexington. On a positive note, we were encouraged with occupancy results in January as same-store physical occupancy increased 70 basis points from year-end, and we ended the month at 94.2%. In addition, to the strength of our portfolio strategy, we are very encouraged by the continued progress and capabilities of our operating platform. We believe the tools and capabilities we have in place particularly in our secondary markets, provide a real competitive advantage. During 2009, we have a number of additional new initiatives we plan to rollout including a revised platform for billing rent and utilities, a new bulk cable initiative, enhanced web based leasing and prospect followup tools, and improved inventory get ready protocols. We made several changes in our collections platform during 2008 and continue to see strong results. Despite the deterioration in the economy in Q4, net collection loss in the fourth quarter was only four-tenths of 1%, a record performance for the company. This speaks to both the strength of our screening and collections operation and also the quality of our assets. Our unit interior and property redevelopment initiative made great progress during 2008 and captured very attractive returns on the capital invested. Given the weaker leasing fundamentals expected in 2009, we are planning to moderate the program this year and are targeting to renovate only about half as many units as we did in 2008. In addition, we will be focussing on executing our lighter or scale down version of the renovations. The last point I’ll make about our positioning for this part of the cycle, concerns our balance sheet. We believe that Mid-America has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector. Our leverage is at the lowest point it has been in our 15-year history as a public company. Our fixed charge coverage ratio has never been stronger. We have already addressed what little refinancing requirements we have over the next couple of years. We have significant balance sheet capacity, and Mid-America has one of the lowest dividend pay out ratios in the apartment REIT sector. When you combine these strong metrics with the fact that our balance sheet is not burdened with supporting a new development operation and is supported by P&L with a high degree of recurring earnings, we believe Mid-America’s balance sheet is well positioned for this part of the cycle. We remain confident that there is going to be some terrific buying opportunities over the next couple of years, and are busy underwriting a number of deals. Overall, the bid-ask spreads remain fairly wide at this point, but as the weaker leasing environment continues to play out, we are optimistic that we will see our underwriting generating pricing that sellers or their lenders are more willing to accept. We have a long track record of disciplined underwriting and capital allocation, it has kept us out of a lot of trouble over the years and it is certainly another aspect of our strategy that puts us in a solid position for this part of the cycle today. Our 2009 forecast contemplates further weakening in the employment markets and we’ve taken a number of steps to pullback on expenses. In addition, to aggressively manage expenses at the property level, we are projecting a reduction in general and administrative expenses of close to 8.5% as compared to 2008. Actions include suspending funding of employee stock ownership program in 2009, and suspending the company match on our 401(k) program. In addition, our executive officer staff will forego salary increases this year. And of course, we expect that bonus compensation associated with 2009 performance will be materially below 2008 results. I’m proud and appreciative of the positive response from Mid-America associates to these actions. As we all work to keep the company strong through this weak part of the economic cycle, and ensure that we are well positioned for the very strong outlook developing for the late next year and into 2011. We are optimistic about the prospects for our business with the continued trend towards a normalized mix of single family and multifamily housing, and a dramatic curtailment in the expected delivery of new apartment properties for the foreseeable future. Once the economy stops shedding jobs, we expect the recovery in leasing fundamentals to be quick and strong. The pullback in the capital markets is now clearly pricing a number of REITs at some very compelling values including Mid-America currently trading at an employee cap rate of 8.25%, which implies a value significantly below anyone's definition of replacement costs, while also currently yielding around 8% against one of the stronger dividend payout ratios in the sector, supported by our balance sheet that's in great shape facing no refinancing requirements, and positioned to capture new value growth. We believe Mid-America offers some attractive opportunities. That’s all I have got Simon. 
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: Eric thanks. Good morning everybody. Our fourth quarter FFO per share of $0.92 was $0.01 ahead of the mid-point of our guidance. Performance was driven by three key elements. Despite weakening employment, our operating results were close to our forecast. Our property management and G&A expense was $900,000 below the same quarter a year ago. And our interest expense also below our forecast as rates began to trend down, reflecting an average interest rate of 4.8%, compared to 5.2% for the same quarter a year ago. In the fourth quarter, the markets were tougher than anyone expected, but we still performed quite well, although our good operating performance was masked by some one-time items and some unusual comparisons. Year-over-year, same-store revenue growth was 0.2%, despite the worse than expected job losses and the tough comparison of the very strong fourth quarter in 2007. Two markets, Atlanta and to a lesser extent Jacksonville were weak, and dragged down our same-store revenue performance. Absent these two markets, our same-store revenues increased 1.0%. Same-store expenses prior to taxes and insurance increased 1.5% and this included $310,000 expenses attributable to Hurricane Ike. Excluding these Hurricane Ike expenses the increase was only 0.1%. Including taxes and insurance, total same-store expenses increased 3.6%, but again this was comparing to an unusual fourth quarter 2007 when same-store expenses dropped 1.2% because of favorable real estate taxes. As a result of last year’s fourth quarter tax adjustments, our same-store real estate taxes increased 7.8% this past quarter. If you normalize the real estate tax increase, and eliminate the hit from Hurricane Ike, our NOI for the quarter goes from a negative 2.1% to a negative 0.7%. So, our reported NOI was not necessarily indicative of our performance in these changing market conditions. For the full year, our FFO per share was $3.73, almost at the midpoint of our initial guidance for 2008, and 5% above 2007. Although, the markets were tougher than we forecast, we made up for almost all the shortfall in NOI through reduced G&A and interest rates. We also ended the year with less debt than planned since we raised over $100 million from new equity at almost $53 a share net of costs. We continued our investment in projects to deliver long-term value, but carry short-term FFO dilution, such as our modest development program in properties in lease-up. Together we estimate that our lease-up properties cost us over $0.16 of FFO dilution in 2008. This should drop to approximately $0.07 in 2009. For the full year, AFFO was $2.99 per share comfortably ahead of our $2.46 dividend, and one of the best dividend coverages of the sector, as Eric mentioned. Excluding the redevelopment program, total property capital expenditures existing properties were $31 million, $753 a unit or $1.05 per share. Revenues in our secondary markets outperformed our primary markets helping to reinforce our views that the secondary markets tend to be pretty stable during a downturn in the economy. Of our primary markets, our three Texas markets plus Raleigh Durham showed good growth. While as I mentioned above Atlanta was weak as to a lesser extent was Jacksonville. NOI growth in several markets and notably Houston, Dallas, Jacksonville, Tampa and Savannah was impacted by favorable adjustments to the real estate tax accrual in the fourth quarter of last year of 2007. Turnover decreased 3.7% for the quarter, compared to the same period a year ago, mainly because of a 20% decline in people leaving us to buy a house, which dropped to 21.6% of move outs from 25.8% in the fourth quarter of 2007. On a trailing 12-month basis, turnover dropped to 61.3% from 63.5%. Our delinquency for the quarter was still encouragingly low at 0.4% down from 0.5% a year ago. Although, we expect that this will be under pressure in 2009. We have one of the strongest financial positions of the apartment REITs. We have taken care of the next two years debt maturities. We put in place new loans in the fourth quarter of last year designated to replace our only maturity in 2009, a $39 million bank facility. Our only 2010 maturity, our $50 million bank credit facility is more than covered by capacity under existing credit arrangements. Although, we do expect to refinance this is in the normal course of business. At December 31, our debt to gross assets was 50%, down 300 basis points from a year-ago. This compares with 55% for the apartment sector as a whole. Our fixed charge coverage in the fourth quarter was 2.51, well ahead of 2.36 a year ago, and also well ahead of the sector median of 2.30. As we detail in the press release, at year-end, we had a $183 million of debt capacity available under our Fannie Mae and bank credit facilities, of which $39 million is designated to fund the loan maturity in April. We have a further $30 million of our existing credit facilities available to be collateralized once we need the capacity, which takes our potential availability to $213 million. In 2009, we have repricing opportunities on a $25 million swap that matures April 1, and $65 million of debt that resets to variable rate on December 1. These are not mortgage maturities, but just a repricing opportunity of in place credit facilities. They are at an average rate of 6.9%, and we anticipate that the new swap rate will be an average of approximately 4.2%, potentially $0.08 of savings on an annualized basis. The savings in 2009 will only be about $0.01 with the full year impact not being realized until 2010. About 20% of our debt is floating rate, which we find as a natural hedge against changes in the economy. Our Fannie Mae variable rate debt that repriced in January was at 1.26%, down from 4.6% in November, which will obviously help us substantially as the first quarter of 2009 progresses. To give you an idea of recent Fannie and Freddie pricing, the loans that we put in place in November and December was single asset seven year loans at 65% loan to value. The first loan was fixed at 6.2%. The second was a capped loan floating at 323 basis points over the Freddie reference bill rate, currently costing us 3.4%. While rates have come down since our November financing, it is quite likely that agency spreads are going to stay wider than they have in the past. Two weeks ago we had talks from the head to multifamily lending for both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and they indicated that the agencies and their new regulator are very supportive of their multifamily programs. Our 2009 forecast detailed in the release takes into account the recession with further job losses taking average unemployment for the year to a range of 8% to 8.5%. The impact of this is partially mitigated by the continuation of the shift-in households back to the rental market, and reduction of resident turnover as well as a relatively more robust employment picture in our Southeastern high growth markets, compared to the national picture. We have given some color on our 2009 forecast in the press release. We are projecting around a 1% drop in same-store revenues, and approximately a 4% drop in same-store NOI. We have several property revenue and expense saving initiatives that are helping to offset weakness that we would otherwise expect. Based on the expected revenue shortfalls in local government, we project a 5% increase in real estate tax expense. Because of G&A and interest rate savings, we believe our FFO will be in a range of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. As we pointed out in the release we also have to absorb impact in 2009 of the implementation of FAS 141R, which requires us to expense transaction cost that were previously capitalized. Based on our current set of assumptions, this non-cash accounting change will cost $0.04 per share of FFO in 2009. We completed the sale of one property in Greensboro, North Carolina, Woodstream in January. This 25-year old property was sold for $11.5 million at around a 7.7% cap rate. We have two other properties under contract for sale: Riverhills in Grenada, Mississippi, and River Trace in Memphis, with total proceeds estimated in the $19 million range around a 6.25% cap rate. All three properties were listed as held for sale at year-end. We have not forecast additional dispositions in 2009. In 2009, we expect property capital expenditures to moderate 7% to $30 million or just under $1 a share, with recurring CapEx in the region of $21.5 million, or $0.70. In addition, we project development funding of $6 million down from $25 million in 2008, and $10 million of redevelopment expenditures, about half of 2008’s level. We anticipate that we’ll invest approximately $75 million in new acquisitions and contribute about $9 million in equity for our share of Fund II, our proposed new joint venture. We assumed that the second joint venture will be structured similarly to Fund I. We will invest a third of the equity in an entity that’s 65% leveraged. Our forecast also assumes that we make $75 million of acquisitions in the second half-year into Fund II. Although, our FFO guidance is not dependent on this as we don’t expect significant earnings accretion in this first year. We plan to finance our investment program with the $30 million of asset sales and our exciting credit facilities, which we mentioned have plenty of capacity. We forecast leverage increase only by 90 basis points at the end of the year, with debt rising from 50.4% to 51.3% of gross assets. As reported, our AFFO in 2008 was $2.99 per share and we are forecasting a range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share for 2009. Our dividend pay out ratio in 2008 was 82% of AFFO, one of the lowest in the sector and compares to 90% for the sector median. In 2009 we’re projecting our payout to rise to 88% at the midpoint of our forecast, still a strong position compared to most of the others. As a point of emphasis, we believe that REITs are structured around the provision of a steady and secured cash dividend. And absent of major deterioration in the apartment or financing markets, we don’t plan any changes to the cash distributions for 2009. Eric?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks, Simon. Last week marked the 15-year anniversary of Mid-America’s IPO. It’s worth noting that despite the significant fall off in our stock price over the past year, the annual compounded return delivered to shareholders over that 15-year period is almost 11%. That performance over the same period of time beats the S&P 500 by roughly 500 basis points. It beats the overall REIT index by over 300 basis points and it beats the overall apartment REIT index by over 200 basis points.  Our record of performance and strategy for creating value continues to be centered on disciplined capital allocation practices, maintaining a high quality portfolio of assets, focused on building high quality and recurring earnings, and supporting future growth, and a cash dividend through maintaining a strong balance sheet. We believe it's just as important to be able to weather downturns effectively as it is to prosper during robust partially real estate and capital market cycle. We are confidant and our ability to perform during this down part of the cycle. And we are excited about the opportunities in front of us. That’s all we have in the way of prepared comments. So, operator, I’m going to turn it back to you for any questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets:  Good morning guys and Simon thank you for the additional color on GSEs there. In your guidance for 2009, can you break out the impact you expect from the bulk cable and utility reimbursement programs? Just so we can get an apples-to-apples comparison on a year-over-year basis?
James Andrew Taylor:
 :
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, that’s helpful. Eric several of your peers have mentioned they think 2010 maybe an equally challenging or even more challenging year. What are you initial thoughts just given the downturn right now and when we come out of that?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Well, Mike obviously it depends on what happens with the economy and the employment numbers and I don’t know, I think that last time we went through a downturn it did last for couple of years, and the sector produced two years of negative NOI performance. I think that is likely that 2010 will indeed be another challenging year. I like to believe that by the last half or maybe by Q4 we really are starting to see things turnaround, but I do think that 2010 will likely be a challenging year. The severity evidence is, I could begin to really guess at it right now. Obviously, we have to see what the government does and how they kind of response to lot of the plans and programs being discussed. But I would certainly think that this current downturn is going to be with us for a while.
James Andrew Taylor: Mike I think one of, Eric and I were at the National Multi Housing Council Conference, couple of weeks ago and recently in the sort of third party economists and market trackers that we saw and listened to kind of indicating a second half of 2010 recovery. And that’s probably the best information at this point that’s opened to us.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Then third and final in your guidance for 2009, you include $75 million of acquisitions in a new fund. How far long are you on that fund in talking to private equity and various other sponsors, what is the appetite right now for multifamily?
James Andrew Taylor: We are really not underway in any meaningful way on that initiative yet and as mentioned our guidance for 2009 really doesn’t depend on getting that fund done. I very much believe that there are going to be some terrific buying opportunities over the next couple of years in this distressed environment. If this is the kind of stuff that we do, I mean we find these kind of situations and we buy opportunistically and then we operate them back to pull value. I think that there is going to be capital out there, institutional capital that understands that, can appreciate that logic, and I’m confident and optimistic that we will get something done. But, in terms of actually engaging in direct conversations, we’ve not done that yet. We had started to do it late last year and frankly just backed off, and we thought we just let the markets kind of settle out for a while. But I’m hopeful that here within the next 90 days or so that we’re engaged in our process to really get a better feel for just how viable this initiative is. I’m convinced it’s there. I know the opportunity is there and I think that there is capital out there that understands that and more importantly understands what 2011 and beyond looks like for the multifamily industry. It looks incredibly strong. And I think that those who are in a position to both weather the downturn for the next couple of years and take advantage to the opportunities presented have a real opportunity in front of them.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Thanks guys.
James Andrew Taylor: Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Rob Stevenson of Fox-Pitt Kelton. Your line is open.
Robert Stevenson – Fox Pitt Kelton:  Good morning guys.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Hi Rob.
Robert Stevenson – Fox Pitt Kelton:  Eric, can you talk a little bit, I mean given your comments about dividend coverage, what’s your thoughts are about the dividend going forward and whether or not we are going to see some token increase? Whether or not you hold it flat to preserve capital in this type of environment? I mean what's the thought at this point from the Board?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Well we had a fair amount of conversation about it back in December and obviously felt appropriate at that time to hold it. In general, we've looked at a number of different scenarios. We've put a lot of stress modeling on our payout ratio and so forth. And just took a look at how bad things could get and before we start to have to make those kind of evaluations about the dividend. And, we believe things could get appreciably worse before we really have to start looking at any sort of action on the dividend. We think that the REIT model and a lot of our owners are in the stock believing that we're going to pay a dividend and we think that’s one of our responsibilities and have tried to build an earnings platform, a balance sheet around that responsibility. So, I would tell you that obviously if the economy continues to go through some sort of real downturn and we got into just a catastrophic scenario, we would take a look at everything including the dividend. But at this point we feel pretty good about it. And feel like that at this level we can sustain it just fine. I'm with doubt that in this environment there will be much of an appetite for raising the dividend. But we feel pretty comfortable of what we are doing right now.
Robert Stevenson – Fox Pitt Kelton: What about paying part of it in the stock? Does things have to get worse before you would consider that or just as a course of business and some of the guys are starting to do that, would you do something like that, in the near-term to continuing to preserve additional cash?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: No. We’ve not had that kind of conversation about paying in dividend and frankly don’t think that that really makes any sense for us at this point. We have got capacity on the balance sheet. We think we’ve got plenty of opportunity to pursue opportunities without having to take action with the dividend to preserve additional capital. I think that broadly speaking there could be situations with certain companies and certain balance sheets, where they run into NOI or net income number where they’ve got to make a dividend payment, in order to keep the REIT status and using stock as a currency may make sense in some cases. But we are not anywhere close to anything like that, and don’t perceive that. But I think as a general rule holding on if you were using your stock as currency at these prices in particular as a means of marshaling or holding cash in order to look for future growth opportunities, I don’t really endorse that model at all.
Robert Stevenson – Fox Pitt Kelton: Okay. And then on the occupancy side I mean, it’s great that you guys were able to fight your way back up 70 basis points in January. Was that pretty much spread across all markets or were there one or two markets where you really saw the big increase?
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: Rob, we saw generally. This is Tom. By the way, but we saw the occupancy job from December to January was across the board, it weren't really any major recovery in one area or the other.
Robert Stevenson – Fox Pitt Kelton: And that was just better traffic or a combination of better traffic and concessions?
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: And primarily it was better traffic, Rob. We had a nice uptick its up about 9.6%. So, primarily traffic we were encouraged by that.
Robert Stevenson – Fox Pitt Kelton: Okay. And then lastly Eric and Simon, I mean, you guys were talking about in your guidance assumptions about the homeownership rate continuing to come down and that benefitting apartments. When you think about your markets right now, if the government wants a passing, something substantial here in terms of a tax incentive to buy housing plus does something with an interest rate buy down, whether or not its 2.99% or 3.99% or something alone those lines, which of your markets do you think have, a stable enough employment and people who might be thinking about moving out and buying a home in this type of environment and would be most impacted by that?
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: Rob, I would guess that you might see some of that pressure if it all plays out as you described in some of the bigger markets like in Atlanta or Dallas or Houston, where you tend to have these bigger, sort of starter home tracks that are out there. And my guess is that’s where if the government did come in and if you will once again artificially create a inducement some sort and starts allowing and putting people in the houses that really can't afford them, then I think that that maybe where the pressure builds much like we've seen over the last several years in some of the bigger markets like Phoenix and Vegas and Dallas and Houston. I think that’s where and some of the obvious down Florida, Tampa and Orlando some of those, but I think that and for us it’s always been an issue over the last several years, the fact that our renters did not have a down payment and frankly did not have the financial wherewithal to be able to afford a mortgage or being put into houses because they do have to come out with a down-payment and they offered all of these teaser rates, where essentially the mortgage payment was artificially low. I don’t think that some of the programs that are being discussed right now are going to actually kind of create that kind of scenario again. So, we are obviously monitoring what some of these programs that the government is talking about doing and I think that the correction back to a more normalized single family home ownership rate may impact the somewhat moderator meted by some of these actions the government is taking, but I think long term, we are still comfortable that the government understands and appreciates a balanced housing policy, balance between single-family and multifamily is a good thing for this country and I’m optimistic that we will continue to work in that direction. I don’t think we can fix it overnight.
Robert Stevenson – Fox-Pitt Kelton:  Thanks guys.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks Rob.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Nap Overton of Morgan and Keegan. Your line is open.
Napoleon Overton – Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning. Couple of things, one in terms of the Fund II in this environment with significant opportunities expected to develop over the next 12 to 18 months. Would have you contemplated just retaining the upside of that benefit for yourself as opposed to trying to pursue a joint venture with the partner?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Well, our plan for our JV initiative is really geared towards targeting investment opportunities that we frankly would prefer to go invest in namely what we are targeting will be turnaround or value add place that we defined as assets being seven years of age or older. We think as a public platform that we do better for long-time public price in the company by keeping our focus up for 100% investments on newer assets and but yet over the years as a company one of our core competencies frankly is locating these opportunities underwriting the upside that’s there and then realizing it through the operations in the CapEx and other things that we’ve been executing on for 15 years. And but we don’t think it will be appropriate to go out and start buying a bunch of older assets that we would own a 100% of them, putting them on the public balance sheet. And of course, as you know, the JV model offers some alternatives in terms of how you approach to use the leverage and fee incomes and things of that nature, which has also created some pretty attractive returns to our shareholder capital. So, we see that initiative is really being a good complement to what we are doing for our own balance sheet and don’t believe there is any conflict issues, but and believe that the JV model is the right way to prosecute those other kind of opportunities I described.
James Andrew Taylor: I think one further point would be, Nap, is that, we like the leverage that we got on the balance sheet, right now and not really anxious to increase it in regard to private equity as a good source of equity particularly where considering where our stock price is trading. So, that adds if you like another arrow in our quiver in terms of our growth of the business.
Napoleon Overton – Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.: Okay. And then one another question and that is if substantial opportunities were to develop, you wanted to take advantage of? What are those balance sheet and their capital structure considerations that would be the larger parameters for your capital structure beyond the immediate capacity that you have available under existing credit facilities?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Well the challenge of course is that, we do thing it’s a time to maintain modest leverage and your question is a good one, because these opportunities may present itself. Certainly, the opportunities would have to be hugely compelling for us to be willing to let go of any equity at the current pricing and so it’s certainly I think that if this downturn in the economy continues for a considerable time and there are compelling opportunities and our stock prices continues to be really depressed then I think that our frankly the way we will go about it would be to look at further partnering with other capital in order to choose the return sufficiently to give us what we need.
James Andrew Taylor: Yeah. And Nap, I mean there is definitely going to be some of those if you will portfolio opportunities, I mean we’ve already seen some and have looked at a number of them frankly over the last year and have continued to, the kind of numbers that would be required for us to be willing to take that kind of risk on right now, I don’t think that the market is there yet. But I think it maybe headed there. But putting the balance sheet at significant risk right now in order to get a deal done is not really what we do. I mean that’s just not our culture, it’s not the way we operate, and so I think that we would be compelled to look at a big opportunity. I mean, we would certainly pursue it if it were the right fit and the right opportunity and very compelling, but we would as part of that event I think we need to do in order to keep the balance sheet for being put at significant risk. We just don't think that's the right way to go about it.
Napoleon Overton – Morgan, Keegan & Company, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Carol Kemple of Hilliard Lyons. Your line is open. 
Carol Kemple – Hilliard Lyons:  Okay. Thank you. Good morning guys.
James Andrew Taylor: Good morning.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Hi.
Carol Kemple – Hilliard Lyons:  I just had a couple of questions. You talked about the uptick in occupancy in January. Where were those new renters coming from? Were they leaving other apartments or why were they getting the lease?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Honestly, off the top of my head, we don’t have the source data for January this quickly at the end of month. So, I mean we've got traffic information. We’ll be reviewing back where the sources of traffic came from, but we don't this early in February we don’t have that analytical data to tell you these people moved out of the house and these folks came with new jobs.
Carol Kemple – Hilliard Lyons:  Okay.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: If that make sense to you?
Carol Kemple – Hilliard Lyons: Yeah. And then just my other question on your G&A and property management expense decline for 2009, do you expect that to be split pretty evenly between the four quarters or more heavily weighted than others?
Albert M. Campbell: I think it will be split fairly evenly. This is Al, Carol.
Carol Kemple – Hilliard Lyons: Okay.
Albert M. Campbell: It will be a little heavier, but in the year just some items with increase the inflation, but fairly even.
Carol Kemple – Hilliard Lyons:  Okay. Okay. Great thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Paula Poskon of Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.:  Thank you and good morning everyone.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Good morning.
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.: Good morning, Paula.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So, in your guidance you've said that you are building your forecast on the assumption that the national unemployment rate will be somewhere between 8% and 8.5%. What do you think the sensitivity is around your guidance if unemployment goes to 10 or above this year?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.:
 :
James Andrew Taylor: Obviously, though trying to take these broad sort of economic metrics, unemployment metrics and applying them to our markets and then applying them to our sub-markets in our neighborhoods and our properties, a lot of different variables go on, but I can tell you that obviously if the economy were to fall off that much weaker, in a while would be, frankly fall off that much more and I can tell you as Al mentioned, we’ve modeled a lot more worst case scenarios in an effort to think about the balance sheet and think about the dividend and we think that we are in a position where we can weather materially worse decline from where we are right now and still, trudge along but why just goes that much more negative frankly. And how much more negative becomes a bit subjective trying to evaluate against our markets, but as I mean we continue to believe that some of these secondary markets will hold up a little better than some in the bigger cities.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks that’s helpful. When we met at NAREIT, we talked a little bit about the LRO program and what information it kicks out to you and your ability to override that system. How is that its results or its recommendations how has that changed? And are you changing your approach in terms of overriding? What it’s telling you?
James Andrew Taylor: Hey Paula, it's Drew. LRO, I think in a weaker environment like we are in now with higher exposures and lower demand. Certainly, there is going to be some pressure on upfront pricing. And our strategy has been and what LRO does is to work to favor and protect occupancy over rents and that’s what we are seeing and that's sort of what we would expect the system to do.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Yeah. I’ll just add it quickly, Paula. This is a side note and because this comes up a lot. Well, LRO, or the Yield Management Systems to be as effective in a downturn as they are in a up part of the cycle and I continue to believe that the system will because we put an LRO believing that it will enable us to manage our revenue results better than we otherwise would be able to simply because we are able to gather more information, more market data, more insight on our own exposure regarding lease expiration. While we gather all those facts quicker, we are able to make a more informed decision and importantly we are able to make that decision faster. And I think the net result is that we generate better revenue results because we are making informed and better decisions, quicker decisions on the ground and that works whether it’s a downturn or whether it’s an upturn.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, just a follow-up on that are you overriding what it’s telling you less than you had been?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: No, well I don’t think we are overriding more or less. I think we don’t tend to override a lot anyway, but the volume of overriding if you will is not really gone up a lot.
James Andrew Taylor: And Paula that’s usually isolated, I mean we've often said with LRO it's not an excuse to turn off your brain.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay.
James Andrew Taylor: And LRO is going to try to fix things with price and if we know that the problem is, every now and then we make a mistake in on site. If we have made one it doesn’t make sense to fix that problem with price. It makes sense to fix the quality of the market right here or something like that. So, that’s where overrides generally come in is where we know something sort of LRO does in and we don’t want it to fix the problem with price.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you, that’s helpful. And then could you give us just a little bit more color around your decision to make the accounting change around the transaction expenses and also the resegmentation of your markets from the three tiers to this primary and secondary?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.:  Al, I want you to address the accounting question?
Albert M. Campbell: Okay. Well the accounting question is FAS 141R I mean just, we are required to beginning the year to go ahead and record transaction costs in our earnings.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: We didn’t have a choice.
Albert M. Campbell: We didn’t have a choice.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. For some reason I thought that there was a voluntary change?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: No, not to my knowledge
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay.
James Andrew Taylor: In fact, January 1 for us. So, that should be as we mentioned about $0.04 per share.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Right, okay.
James Andrew Taylor: It will happen probably towards the back half of the year obviously with the transactions that we’re talking about it. And I think on the segmentation, I think we just clarified or refined our segmentation in a way we felt better, it looks at the characteristics of our portfolio. And so what you have is in the primary markets, really you have markets that have populations that are a million above and that have investments of public REIT portfolios greater than 1%, and we felt like that was a good indicator of the gross margin.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Yeah, I mean quite frankly I think the terms we have had in the past that is sort of three tier definition is adding a level of detailed complexity that really is unnecessary I mean what we find is that its generally the secondary markets regardless of how small they may or may not be generally tend to perform somewhat aligned with each other and the large tier markets tend, so we just really felt that the added complexity was not really adding any value and the segmentation between primary and secondary just generally makes more sense, but then of course in our supplemental we detail out a lot of detail about, markets we have the larger concentrations.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That’s very helpful. Thanks guys. 
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks Paula.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sheila Mcgrath of KBW. Your line is open.
Sheila Mcgrath – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:  Good morning. I just was wondering if you could touch on Houston, are you seeing that market negatively impacted by lower energy pricing?
James Andrew Taylor: Not, not yet [Paula] I mean Houston on the revenue side, we are still seeing positive job growth, what we are monitoring a little bit there is just deliveries. Houston absorbed almost 12,000 units in 2008. We expect that number to drop to half so we're encouraged by that. But overall it’s been a positive story excluding obviously on the NOI side the Hurricane Ike charges.
Sheila Mcgrath – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: And Al, are there other markets that you are concerned about from the supply side like how is Austin looking?
Albert M. Campbell:  Austin, I mean you've sort of answered, you stole my answer, Sheila. Yeah, Austin 4,500 units delivered this year, which is a sort of tight spot next year it's 9,500. So, we've got good job growth in Austin to offset it, we feel like we are well positioned there, but we are going to be monitoring the supply in Austin.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: I mean Austin is clearly one of those markets that's going to get is a little bit an outlier in terms of supply, but fortunately that also is a market that tends to have stronger demand side story, I think it's associated with it. And so we think that that market while certainly will be weaker in '09 versus '08. We don’t see it as being a collapsed scenario there.
Sheila Mcgrath – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Okay, great. And last question you did mention that GSEs, but I was just wondering if you could give us little more specifics on your conversations with them, and looking towards their kind of mandate to lower their balance sheet in 2010. What are you or other industry people are thinking about their appetite going forward?
Simon R. C. Wadsworth:  Well I will sort of throw one comment and I think the way that I believe that they are planning to address this Sheila is by offering current and new programs that are off their balance sheet, that is where they guarantee or securitize mortgage-backed securities and I think Freddie has got number of initiatives in that regard Fannie has already has some. So, I think that’s how they are planning to deal with it. Certainly, we will be heard from the heads of both of the multi-family programs, where that they are aware of the capacity issues that will present themselves. And they are very committed to multi-family and do plan to address them in this manner. We will be meeting with Freddie and Fannie in the next 30 days, which we do once a year, and we discuss our business strategy with them and their strategy. But from what we heard things are well in hand and pretty positive.
Sheila Mcgrath – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And we have a question from Philip Martin of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Philip Martin – Cantor Fitzgerald: Good morning.
James Andrew Taylor: Hey Philip.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.:  Good morning.
Philip Martin – Cantor Fitzgerald: I jumped on 25 minutes late, so if you've answered this I am happy to deal with it offline, but kind of a general question, but, at least from my analysis, your typical property seems to offer a nice blend of very nice amenities to newer products, it’s relatively affordable and it’s in affordable markets. To what extent is that giving you a bit of a competitive advantage in this market, I know job growth drive so much of multi-family demand certainly, but the affordability that the amenity package, the affordable markets, how much of a competitive advantage do you have versus your competition in a market like this. People have to live somewhere and not everybody is going to move back home with mom and dad, I mean I know I would hate to do that personally, but…
Thomas L. Grimes Jr.:  Well, I mean I do think that we may in fact have a little bit of an advantage in this cycle, and that as you point out I think we offer a very good value for the renter in that we do provide, I think generally in all the submarkets, in the markets where we compete. We tend to have one of the newer products, we have one of the newer portfolios in the REIT sector, and we and in our region of the country the newer products tends to sell very well. And, we are not in the downtown areas, we don’t have the heavy urban element to our portfolio. We are and frankly in our region of the country we are out where people really want to live, these are good school districts, good retail shopping, good amenities and the crime issues are lot less out in the suburbs, where we tend to have a lot of our assets, and I think that while I think we offer people a good value in this environment. So, we will see, but certainly during the last downturn as we did mention in the call that, the company did pretty well on a relative basis, and I think that may very well play out again this time.
Philip Martin – Cantor Fitzgerald: And again you may have addressed this in the opening remarks, but are you seeing, are tenants I am sure coming to you and looking to negotiate rents et cetera just trying to stay in the property, just because they need to live somewhere, but they don't really want to move and how much of that are you seeing?
Albert M. Campbell: I mean we are seeing some of it, but the overall, we sent our offer out, we followup with it very quickly, we negotiate if needed and if pushed, but really and you can see it, I mean the inverse of our turnover rate is our retention rate. And our turnover rate is down and our retention rate is up. And we’re providing really sort of a better alternative for people than the substitute, for sure which is as you said, you don’t want to move back with your parents and not many folks are interested in buying a house right now.
Philip Martin – Cantor Fitzgerald: Is your portfolio still in all or most of its markets still outperforming in terms of an occupancy standpoint. And then I don't know if you can calculate it or not, but even from an operating margin standpoint?
Albert M. Campbell: We track the best information we have is versus REITs and in that case we are significantly outperforming the REIT index of our, we do a composite of our markets and compare it to our actual occupancy and we’re outperforming that.
Philip Martin – Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay, okay, okay. Thank you very much.
Albert M. Campbell: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you sir. Our next question is from Michael Salinsky of RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Just sort of a follow-up question real quick. Can you talk about cap rates right now across your markets? I mean, how much your cap rates move in the past 90 days?
James Andrew Taylor: Well, it’s kind of hard to get a real read on that, any sort of definitive way, because frankly the transaction volume is so down right now and nothing has really been trading for the last 90 days. I think that the seller pricing probably is looking still for six maybe even sub-six that mid-six range and the buyers are wanting something well north of that and so you've got this sort of stalemate right now. Having said that we just sold a 25-year-old asset in Greensboro, North Carolina, which is by any definition I think a tertiary market. So, a 25-year-old asset in a tertiary market, sold for a 7, 7 cap rate, we've got two other assets, one here in Memphis, which is one of our older assets and one in Grenada, Mississippi, which is maybe sub-tertiary I don’t know but it’s, we've got those both on a contract at 6, 6 cap rate. So, I think that it’s hard to know exactly how they've moved in a broad sense right now, but, clearly buyers are looking for a better deal and we think that its likely that the cap rates are in general, when the transaction line picks up are going to show, something probably approaching somewhere between 6.5 and 7, maybe a little higher than that. I don’t know. It will vary quite a bit.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: What does the buyer contingent look like right now?
James Andrew Taylor: I’m sorry the buyer contingent? 
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Yeah. I mean where is the people that are out there actively bidding on these properties I mean what is the?
James Andrew Taylor: There is a lot of, I mean, some of the private capital buyers that have some of these funds are out there and we that's usually who we’re running into right now as some of the smaller guys, who have got money that they are representing somebody else on, kind of the vulture buyer kind of mindset is sort of out there right now?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: I think there is still plenty of people out there, Mike because they see what we see and that is that 2011, ‘12 look pretty incredible for the multi-family sector. So, the lot of people that appreciate that, but there is as they are excess there is just big ad spread right now. Everybody is kind of waiting to see what happens. And that’s been going for a while may continue for another three or six months I don’t know we are beginning to see more signs of sort of stress with some of these over leveraged portfolios with mezz debt or bridge debt that’s not being able to be handled and that make cause a bit of a break, we’ll see, but there is still plenty of buys and of course the agencies out there, willing to finance as sensibility underwritten deal. And they are certainly not giving their money away and there is certainly underwriting as they always has done in my view, in an intelligent manner, but it’s, so we, I think the deals will be out there but its maybe just a little while yet.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Haven’t seen any a shift in focus, I mean is it still primarily on the value added or have you seen a shift back to quality?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Well, I think what we are seeing most of the transactions that are clearing right now are taking place at the lower end of the quality scale, kind of the C quality, B quality assets, B- minus assets that's where you're starting to see more transaction volume phase pickup as a result of I mean frankly I think that’s where most of the financing stress is currently the upper end product quality, which is where we are focusing our efforts on we haven't seen that’s where the bid-ask is still pretty heavy and the transaction volume is really just not there.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Thank your. Our next question is from Rich Anderson. Sir your line is open.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Thanks and good morning. Sorry, I got in the queue earlier, but I think I got blackballed there might have been [because]. 
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Yeah. We gave special instruction.
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: We are just glad it's the real, Rich Anderson
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets:  Well I got in the queue as [Bruce Springsteen] that might have been the reason. So, now we know that the people are doing their job and filling their job for you, so anyway. Just couple of quick questions the 20% floating rate debt, is that a level you are comfortable with or could you see that may be come down now with rates being where they are, would you consider that?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: We are Rich it's good, great question and as we move into 2009 forecast, we expect our 80% to move down a little bit, and it will go down maybe come backup as we end the year, trying to take care some of the transaction that come due end of the year. We expect about 78% to 80% average for 2009. We do have to put a point there another 6% cap, which we only have 14% of our debt just totally unhedged. So, we are benefiting from the low floating rate of a whole 20 with the hedge from our 60% that an important point I think.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And Simon you mentioned the $0.80 annual impact from the reprising of the swap and other factors right, but it's only $0.01 in 2008. Can you explain why it's happening in April?
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: Right. Well there were really two tranches one is a swap that matures April 1. And there is lot more $65 million of REIT prices December 1.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. 
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: And that’s the high interest rate while really where we really get juice is on that December 1 maturity?
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. I know you have a lot of, you have a line-up of swap expirations in the forward years what is it in 2010 that you have expiring?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: A $140 million, in swaps Rich, $148 million in total of everything. 
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: 140, okay, great. Real quickly Eric you mentioned lower CapEx for 2009 is that a smart thing to do in this environment and potentially incurring some deferred maintenance?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Well we are not incurring any deferred maintenance, we've maintained very active CapEx program for 15 years and properties are in terrific shape. And we go through various cycles sometimes where paint jobs and other things tend to be a little higher and the numbers can move around a little bit, but Drew you want to add something to that.
James Andrew Taylor: Yeah. I was just going to say we are planning the same level of recurring CapEx next year that we planned this year is slightly less on the revenue enhancing and I think as Eric mentioned significantly less on the redevelopment.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. On the accounting change FAS 141R is not a new pronouncement, I am curious why didn’t you have these expenses in 2008?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: The implementation is required for January 1 of this year, Rich.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Of this expense elements to the year?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: And put the expense the brokerage and accounting cost or the legal cost something in earnings instead of being capitalized into the deal.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And they will show up in operating expenses I assume?
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: They will, show up, yes they will show up in G&A.
James Andrew Taylor: Probably be in G&A.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: G&A, excuse me.
James Andrew Taylor: Yeah.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. And then lastly you are looking to Texas as a couple of good markets for 2009. I mean how long can that hold up when you consider, oil prices and some other factors, I mean does Texas have the fire power to stay at top market for you throughout the year?
James Andrew Taylor: I mean Rich, for ’09 those are the strongest markets that are out there. They are all positive and honestly in terms of job growth for forecast for 2009. Are they going to add 10% new jobs or 4% new jobs absolutely not, but on a relative basis, they will be our strongest markets. And then we will monitor a little bit, we will monitor the new construction there and as I mentioned Austin is up a little, but Houston's number drops in half. So, and I think we'll still continue to see some job growth out there, which compared to the rest of the country these days are pretty darn and good.
Richard Anderson – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, good thanks. I appreciated it. Good call.
James Andrew Taylor: Thanks Rich.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question in the queue is from Cassandra Kimberly of Commercial Appeal. Your line is open.
Cassandra Kimberly – Commercial Appeal: Hi, good morning everyone.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Good morning.
James Andrew Taylor: Good morning, Cassandra.
Cassandra Kimberly – Commercial Appeal: Hey, I was hoping that you could speak directly to the Memphis market for a second, how are we faring compared to the other markets that you're in?
James Andrew Taylor: In terms of our portfolio Cassandra to the Memphis market and I think you're relatively familiar with it. Our occupancy and our revenue levels are significantly higher than the market right now.
Cassandra Kimberly – Commercial Appeal: Okay, great. And is this just due to the properties that you all are just maintaining then and being higher quality or what would attribute this to?
James Andrew Taylor: I would certainly credit the asset management, property management teams and how we operate properties. But again your familiarity with Memphis it's our location as well we've picked up submarkets very carefully. We've limited our exposure to the areas in the South of Memphis that has been tougher over the last 10 years and so it's really a combination of Mid-America's sort of people practices and then its location of its product.
Cassandra Kimberly - Commercial Appeal: Great. All right. Wonderful well thank you very much. I appreciate it.
James Andrew Taylor: Thanks Cassandra
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: Thank you.
Cassandra Kimberly - Commercial Appeal: Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you, sir. I show no further questions in the queue. Please proceed with any further remarks.
H. Eric Bolton Jr.: No further remarks. Thanks for being on the call. Thanks.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating in the Mid-America Property Communities third quarter earnings release conference call. The company will first share its prepared comments followed by a question and answer session. At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Director of External Reporting.
Leslie Wolfgang: Good morning, everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Director of External Reporting for Mid-America Apartment Communities. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Simon Wadsworth, our CFO; Al Campbell, Treasurer; Tom Grimes, Director of Property Management; and Drew Taylor, Director of Asset Management. Before we begin I want to point out that as part of the discussion this morning company management will make forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today’s prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning’s call can be found on our website. I will now turn the call over to Eric.
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: Thanks Leslie, and thanks for joining our call this morning. We were pleased with FFO reports for the quarter, despite continued weakness in the economy, extraordinary volatility in the debt markets, very challenging prior year expense comparisons, and steps taken to further strengthen the balance sheet, FFO was better than we expected.  FFO for the quarter was driven by stable revenue performance, lower G&A costs, and lower financing costs. Excluding the expenses associated with Hurricane Ike, FFO was $0.02 above the mid-point of our guidance, and equal to the record high third quarter FFO result reported last year. Revenue growth was driven by stable occupancy and strong results in collections. Same store occupancy ended the quarter at a very solid 95.4%. When compared to last year’s exceptionally strong 96.4%, the 100 basis point decline did pressure year-over-year revenue performance, but given the more difficult economic environment, we are encouraged with the results. Ninety-five percent occupancy is pretty strong. Helping to offset some of the moderation in leasing conditions is lower resident turnover and vacancy lost from move outs, as compared to last year. As we indicated would be the case in our second quarter conference call, we believe it will be difficult to push pricing aggressively on new resident leases over the next few quarters.  We were encouraged, however, by the performance in pricing renewal leases as effective pricing on leases renewals was up 4% as compared to prior year. Capturing that level of price increase, while at the same time reducing resident turnover by 6%, is pretty strong performance and brings further support to our belief that revenue performance from Mid-America’s portfolio should hold up over the next few quarters. It’s also important to point out that two markets across the portfolio were largely responsible for the overall moderation in year-over-year revenue growth: Atlanta and Jacksonville.  Atlanta is a market where weak employment trends earlier in the year became more pronounced in Q3. Year-to-date job losses in Atlanta are 53,000 with 35,000 of those losses coming in Q3. This pressure generated a 240 basis point decline in effective occupancy for our Atlanta properties.  Jacksonville has battled a combination of new supply that came on earlier this year and weak employment conditions with 22,000 jobs lost year to date. This generated a 250 basis point decline in effective pricing for our Jacksonville group of properties.  We expect both of these markets will show improving trends next year as new supply pressure moderates and job loss trends bottom out. While our outlook for revenue growth over the next few quarters will be impacted by weaker job growth trends, remember that Mid-America’s portfolio is not materially exposed to the oversupply of single-family homes and condo markets.  And, given our investment in a number of secondary markets in the Southeast that are not experiencing the volatility in employment conditions seen in the larger markets, we expect Mid-America’s portfolio performance will not experience as much pressure as others.  As reported in our earnings release, you’ll note that Mid-America’s stable income in smaller market segment outperformed the other two segments of the portfolio. Overall, same store leasing traffic was up on a year-over-year basis, resident turnover was down, occupancy is holding up, and pricing weaknesses largely isolated to new resident leases. As a result, we believe Mid-America is well positioned to weather this slowdown in the economy.  Longer term, the continued shift of more households to apartments and away from the single family market, along with the dramatic decline in new apartments starts, once we get some positive traction back into the employment trends, leasing conditions should turn positive and do so quickly.  As expected, same store operating expenses in the third quarter, reflected higher than normal year-over-year growth as we were comparing against an unusually low prior-year benchmark of only 0.3% growth in operating expenses.  In addition, the quarter’s results were also pressured by expenses from Hurricane Ike. Simon will give you more details on the various components driving the expense performance. But we’re comfortable that after another tough comparison in the upcoming 4th quarter, with a prior year benchmark of negative expense growth of 1.2%, we will see property operating expenses trend more in line with our historical norms.  In addition to questions about the leasing environment, the other item under focus in this market is, of course, the balance sheet. This is another component of our platform and strategy that places Mid-America in a solid position. Of the total $1.4 billion in outstanding financing, we have only $39.0 million, or roughly 3%, of our total debt facing refinancing next year. Further, in 2010, we again have only another 4% of our debt facing refinancing.  Mid-America has one of the strongest dividend and fixed-charge coverage ratios in the sector and we’ve raised $104.0 million of additional equity this year, prior to the recent collapse in the capital markets. Altogether, this puts us in a solid position to be more disciplined in our management of assets, sales, and in our pursuit of new growth opportunities. Mid-America does not have the pressure of liquidity concerns and exposure to the current debt markets associated with securing financing for new development and material re-financing requirements.  We’re very pleased with the acquisitions completed in the 3rd quarter and we remain active in the market, looking at a number of opportunities. Obviously, given the dramatic shift in the capital markets and the rise in the cost of capital over the last couple of months, we’re being very careful in our analysis and decisions of any current use of capital. We continue to believe there are going to be some terrific buying opportunities over the next year. In summary, we believe Mid-America is well positioned to weather this period of moderating leasing conditions and volatility in the capital markets. With our exposure to a wide range of markets and a proven operating platform, we like our situation.  We have several new initiatives underway for next year that will we believe will further boost our internal growth prospects, including a new bulk cable program, a fully integrated online leasing program, and new resident utility billing programs.  Our interior redevelopment program continues to make steady progress and will make an increasing contribution to revenue growth. We have a number of lease-up and new developments projects underway that are diluting this year’s FFO by $0.16 per share. These investments will all become productive next year. The balance sheet is in terrific shape. We have the ability to selectively and carefully pick opportunities for capturing new value for our shareholders. In all, we believe that Mid-America is in a good position to play defense as needed during this period with the added capability to jump on opportunities that these markets will undoubtedly create. That’s all I have. I’m going to turn it over to Simon.
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: We were pleased that our third quarter FFO was ahead of our forecast, given the economic issues, the impact of Hurricane Ike, and our reduced leverage. Our top line was softer than we anticipated and property expenses showed a temporary spike, but these were more than offset by less G&A and interest expense. As Eric mentioned, revenues were weak in Atlanta and especially in Jacksonville, and excluding these two markets, our revenue performance was more in line with our expectations for same store revenue growth of 2.5%.  We stepped up our marketing efforts after the slowdown in traffic we experienced in June and walk-in traffic was up by 2.7% over the same quarter a year ago on a same store basis.  We saw leasing conditions become more challenging as although our lease applications rose, the number of credit turndowns increased by 5%. Physical occupancy ended the quarter at 95.4% which was solid performance, as the level we achieved at the end of September a year ago was exceptionally high. Effective rent increased by 1.6%, which was the major contributor to our same store increase of 1.4%. Our bad debt expense continued to improve with net delinquency down 9% to 0.5 % of net potential rent, although we do think credit will become more challenging as we go into next year. And so we’re taking all early steps to combat this potential pressure. The same store concession rate dropped from 2.2% to 0.8% of net potential rent, as we continue to migrate towards net effective pricing of most of our properties.  We continue to see a reduction in the number of our residents leaving us to buy a house, down 22% from 25% of move-outs in the third quarter last quarter of last year to 21.5% this year. The number of our residents that left to rent a house is insignificant at 4% of move-outs. Quarterly resident turnover on an annualized basis dropped from 77% to 71%, or from 63% to 62% on a trailing twelve-month basis. The same store operating expenses were above the level we projected. As mentioned in the release, two events, Hurricane Ike and the large credit to real estate taxes last year, contributed 2.5% of the increase. A further 0.8% was due to higher personnel and make-ready costs we discussed in the release. In other words, without these unusual or one-time items our same store expense increase would have been 3.6%, more in line with our normal expectations.  As Eric mentioned, these issues should work their way through by the fourth quarter or at least by the first quarter of 2009. We’ve noted before that expense comparisons with the fourth quarter of last year will be tough, a period when our same store expenses dropped by 1.2%. As Eric mentioned, our balance sheet is in great shape with minimal commitments, and all but $6.0 million of our developments are complete and funded. We have no further debt maturities in 2008 and just $39.0 million of debt maturities in 2009, which will pre-fund with new Freddie Mac debt during the fourth quarter.  We’re putting this brief funding in place four or five months ahead of the more normal schedule. We figure this will cost us $0.02 a share, including $0.05 a share in the fourth quarter, but we’re willing to pay this just to be doubly sure we have the financing we will need. In 2010 our only debt maturity is our $50.0 million line of credit that we anticipate renewing in the ordinary course of business, and our major debt funding, which is through agency credit facilities, begin maturing in tranches between 2011 and 2018.  We use swaps on our credit facilities to reduce interest rate risk and these are laddered to mature over the next seven years. At the end of the quarter, we had $174.0 million of combined capacity available in excess cash, pre-committed agency credit facilities, and our bank line of credit.  We’ve continued to strengthen the balance sheet using our continuous equity program. We raised $99.0 million of new common equity through the end of the third quarter, plus a further $5.0 million in October, and we’ve averaged a net price of $52.98 before we closed down the program when REIT stock prices dropped. Our debt stands at 51% of gross assets, down from 52% in September last year, and this compares to a second quarter second sector median of 55%. At the midpoint of our 2008 guidance, our dividends are 66% of FFO and 83% of AFFO, both in the best one-third of the sector. Our fixed-charge coverage ratio of 2.5 is also in the top one-third of the sector.  Our cash flow and FFO are high quality, almost entirely derived from income derived from income related to apartment rentals, not from transactions or asset sales. Our swaps and floating red debt are either directly or indirectly tied to LIBOR and increased volatility impacts our cost of funds. In the six weeks following the Lehman bankruptcy, LIBOR spiked, rising from 2.80 to 4.82%, before dropping back down again. It seems that LIBOR volatility is declining and returning to more reasonable levels. We estimate that this spike will cost us around $0.15 per share of FFO in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we acquired three high quality properties, which represent the kind of opportunities we are increasingly seeing as sellers become more anxious and the acquisition environment improves. We expect a blended NOI yield of approximately 6.3% from these properties in the first quarter of the first year of operation. We targeted four properties for disposition totaling 990 units, representing a cross section of all the properties that no longer fit our objectives. At the present time we anticipate that three of them will sell for about $28.0 million, a 6.8% cap rate around the end of this year or early next year.  We’re reviewing purchase proposals on the fourth, with a possible delay of the sale until the markets settle. For the same reasons that acquisition opportunities are improving, disposition pricing is becoming a little less attractive. But we’re in the fortunate position of not needing to sell assets to raise cash to fund our business and are entirely focused on the smart recycling of our capital. Our redevelopment program continues to generate attractive returns with interior renovations on 3,100 apartments completed through the end of September. We’ve planned to redevelop a total of 3,800 this year, at an average cost of $4,900 per apartment. So far, we’ve seen the renovated units generate an average incremental revenue per lease of $95 a month, and a 10% unleveraged IRR.  In addition, we have five exterior repositioning projects scheduled to begin this year totaling $2.0 million. We underwrite these exterior projects to generate the same kind of returns, through additional rental rates, as for our interior renovations.  We’re carefully monitoring our redevelopment program as some markets soften. It’s likely that due to the tougher economy we will tend to focus more on some of the renovate-like projects, lower investment per unit, where we don’t need to achieve such a large revenue increase. And we may moderate the number of apartments selected. The two new development projects, Copper Ridge in Dallas, and St. Augustine, Phase II in Jacksonville, are on schedule for completion in the fourth quarter with total remaining investment of $6.0 million.  Copper Ridge has started lease-up, which is proceeding well, and at the end of October 90 of 141 available apartments were leased. The first building of St. Augustine is just coming online and we have 19 apartments pre-leased.  Due to the rapid lease-up of Copper Ridge, we’re exploring bringing forth the construction of 45 additional units and will likely commence construction early in 2009, with a probable additional investment of around $4.0 million, partly built on 12 acres of adjacent land that we purchased during the quarter. We’ve dialed back our expectations for the economy, and for the balance of this year we project slower revenue growth, partly offset by reduced G&A costs.  In the fourth quarter, we expect increased interest cost due to the LIBOR spike that I mentioned, and due to the early funding of the $39.0 million of 2009 debt maturity.  We’ve taken the mid-point of our FFO forecast for the fourth quarter, and for 2008, down by $0.03 from our prior guidance. We’ re now projecting same store NOI growth for 2008 in the range of 1% to 1.5%. This is based on revenue growth of 2.0% to 2.5% growth, and expense growth in a range of 3.25% to 3.75%.  We’ve previously pointed out that we have tucked comparisons in the back half of 2008 due to the very favorable insurance renewal and real estate tax adjustments that have benefited us in 2007. The reductions in forecasted same store NOI is partially offset by increased NOI from acquisitions and by less G&A expense than we had anticipated.  We have a few more shares outstanding than we’d planned last quarter, which is modestly dilutive to FFO per share. Year to date, we’ve raised $104.0 million more equity than we originally forecasted, costing us $0.04 per share of FFO dilution for all of this year.  We expect about $0.16 of FFO dilution for the full year from the recent acquisitions of properties and lease-ups , including Taos Ranch in Phoenix and from development in properties. 
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: We hope that the key points you take away from this morning’s call are the following:  First, the fundamentals driving revenue growth, while moderating in Q3, are holding up. We expect to carry our current trends in occupancy and pricing into Q4 and 2009, at which point prior-year comparisons should turn more favorable towards the back half of the year.  We believe Mid-America’s profile, quality of product, and strength of operating platform will drive stable performance over the next few quarters. Second, a significant aspect of the operating expense pressure in Q3 and expected in Q4 is attributable to very tough prior-year comparisons, one-time events, and trends that we expect to moderate. And lastly, Mid-America’s balance sheet is in good shape. We’re fortunate to have raised $104.0 million of additional equity earlier this year . We have the capacity and coverage to be patient and disciplined with capital decisions during a time of significant volatility and opportunity. And a final point that I want to make, with only a couple of months left to go this year, our revised FFO expectations for the year are within $0.03 per share at the midpoint of where we started the year.  When you consider that our original expectations did not assume we would raise any new equity this year, or that the economy would be this week for this long, or that the capital and debt markets would b this volatile, and yet, overall FFO expectations are this close to where we started t the year, it says something very positive about the stability of our strategy, the high quality of our earnings, and the strength of our operations. We believe we are well positioned for this part of the cycle and we look forward to executing on the opportunities before us.  That’s all we have in the way of prepared comments. I’m going to turn it over for any questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets : Eric, you talked about Jacksonville and Atlanta, are there any other markets right now that you are seeing really concerning trends?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: You know, Mike, I would say, generally not, but I’m going to let Tom answer that question.
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: The good news is generally not in a place where we have a high concentration. South Florida and Phoenix, though, on an absolute basis, have seen the most job loss with about 116,000 jobs here today in Phoenix and over 100,000 in South Florida.  But we’ve held up fairly well in those markets because of location and frankly, low exposure. Those are the two toughest.
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: As you know, we only have one property in south Florida and two in Phoenix, so it’s not a big component of our portfolio.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets : So the rest of the Texas markets and everything, Memphis, Nashville, they seem to be holding up pretty good?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: Yes, it’s all holding up fairly well. Our big exposure on the tough side was really Jacksonville and Atlanta this go around.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets : Can you talk a little bit about acquisitions, are you seeing any distress out there, where is asset pricing right now?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: We are definitely seeing some distress out there. We’re seeing a lot of deals that we’ve passed on or that we put numbers out on that are coming back, and I couldn’t being to tell you where cap rates are right now. There’s not a whole lot, as you know, trading hands right now. Not a lot of activity happening. There’s still a spread, I think, between the bid/ask, and there’s still a sort of a point of who’s going to blink first I think is still out there. I think that if the fundamentals continue to hold up, I think we’re going to continue to see transaction volume remain somewhat low simply because I think if the sellers can hang on, I think they’re going to definitely hang on.  But you know, where we’re seeing the best opportunities and the most distressed are clearly in the lease-up situations. Developers are having a very difficult time. Of course there’s some real distress out there with some of the failed condo projects and frankly, just anybody that’s facing any sort of re-financing requirement over the next year tends to be a little bit more motivated to make something happen.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets : Where are your target rates right now for new acquisitions?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: Target rates?
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets : Yes.
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: Our hurdle rate? Well, obviously our cost of equity has risen dramatically, and you know we use this dividend discount model primarily to evaluate our hurdle rate. I think our dividend yield now is probably 7.5%, so it takes using this long-term growth rate to get up to 15 %to 15.5% hurdle rate return on equity.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets : I know you haven’t given guidance for 2009, the bulk cable program you announced, how much should we look for that to contribute to earnings next year?
James Andrew Taylor: We like bulk cable. It’s something that we’ve got testing right now and something that, with our one connect bulk cable program, it’s generally good for us and good for our residents, but it’s certainly not without risk, it’s not a lay down deck, so we want to approach bulk cable, you know, somewhat cautiously, much like we would do any other major new initiative.  I think the long and short of it is right now we have $1.4 million in cable revenue. Most of that is traditional. Next year we expect to grow at something on the order of $600,000 and then in 2010 another $750,000 or something like that.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets : So not a significant contribution next year but probably the year out?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: $600,000 would be the number for next year, which is meaningful, that’s $0.02 a share and then maybe $750,000 the year after, so it’s meaningful.
Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets : There are no expenses associated with that?
James Andrew Taylor: That’s net revenue.
Operator: Your next question comes from Napoleon Overton - Morgan Keegan.
Napoleon Overton - Morgan Keegan: A couple of things, the $0.16 estimated dilution from development projects this year, do you think that stays about the same next year? Does it go up or down, what’s your gut feeling?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: Al Campbell is going to answer that for you.
Albert M. Campbell: $0.16, that’s going to improve pretty significantly next year as some of these projects begin to become formed better and begin to meet expectations. We expect it to do down to about $0.10 next year. 
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: Go from $0.16 to $0.06.
Napoleon Overton - Morgan Keegan: Does that response incorporate any anticipated new projects or unanticipated new projects?
Albert M. Campbell: No. That’s current projects in place now. It does include the latest ones we did in Atlanta that was somewhat lease-ups we bought a few months ago and ends at Lion’s Gate, that has slight lease-ups that remain, but that’s it.
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: And if we go ahead with this expansion of Copper Ridge, which is a couple of buildings, that would an additive to that, and then you know it’s a good point that we might find some really good struggling lease-up so we might try to buy.
Napoleon Overton - Morgan Keegan: I know you don’t know the answer to this question, but if you were to take a reasonable estimate at acquisition volume over in 2009, what would a reasonable man estimate that might be?
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: My guess is in normal times we would be modeling $150.0 million, but we’d probably be going in with an estimate more like $100.0 million next year, just because we’ve got to look at all the alternatives when we go into next year, but I think that would be a reasonable man’s. 
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: And I would tell you that in this environment, the acquisitions that we would be looking at, I mean, obviously, as always, we ‘re looking for an internal rate of return that’s in well in excess of our cost of capital.  We are a little more sensitive to putting money out that has current dilution impact right now and thus if our acquisition volume next year was say, $100.0 million, I certainly would hope that a good component of that would be break-even to slightly accretive next year, in terms of FFO. There may be some dilution associated with putting that money out but we just don’t know yet.
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: The other component, which we really haven’t talked about is that we are going to be trying see if we can put the fund, too, and a joint venture together, which again we would hope that we could, which would be additive to earnings and we’re obviously we’re just beginning work on that and we don’t know the demand for that kind of a value-add type of fund but we’re going to be working on that and probably with a goal of maybe $150.0 million of acquisitions in that next year, if we can make it happen.
Napoleon Overton - Morgan Keegan: Simon, what was it, I think I understood you to say in your remarks that you had about $174.0 million in total capacity between cash and excess facilities and bank lines of credit. The difference, if I understood that right, between that and the $132.0 million availability that shows up in the text of the press release, would be what?
Albert M. Campbell: $132.0 was on the agencies alone. And the other was on our credit line with Commercial Bank [inaudible].
Napoleon Overton - Morgan Keegan: So when would you expect in this cycle, when should we expect concessions to start edging up? They’ve been coming down for several quarters in a row, when would you expect them to begin to edge up?
James Andrew Taylor: Just to give you a yield management perspective on it, we’re sort of a net pricing operator now. We really don’t employ concessions as part of our model so I think what you would see, really rather than concessions go up, you know, in a weaker leasing environment, you see front-end pricing go down.  I think what we’ve seen, in the third quarter we saw our new lease pricing go down about 1%, our renewal pricing go up about 4%, all the while maintaining an occupancy, a stable occupancy, at 95% +. So I think that’s what LRO tends to do in a weaker leasing environment, which is hang on to occupancy, and if there’s a trade-off, it’s sort of to give up a little bit on front end on rents. 
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: You seem to refer more and more to what we call, refer to, net effective pricing, which is really the combination of rent change and any concession change, and we just use that metric now because it kind of brings everything into play, but the idea of going back and using a lot of concessions, that’s really not in our business model any longer.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Could you talk a little bit about any information you might have, anecdotal or otherwise, about trading down trends among tenants or doubling up?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: We monitor that a little bit and sort of the main thing that would indicate the trend down would be an abandonment of our one-bedroom units, you know as people double up, and we’ve monitored pretty closely, they remain in our highest lease percentage unit in the portfolio. So that’s sort of the key thing.  And then we also measure a number of resident quality metrics, but I don’t think that’s quite what you’re after right now, it was really the trade-down answer, is that correct? And we’re not seeing that right now.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: And then just keeping with the tenant profile discussion, have you made any changes to your desired credit profile?
James Andrew Taylor: We have made, I would say, some targeted, small changes, but , you know, our credit profile is something certainly that we take very seriously and you know there are a lot of implications to lowering those and making any sort of dramatic shifts in the way we approve people.  So, I would say we’ve made some slight modifications in certain situations where we feel like we could give up a little bit in terms of our quality so that we can attract, perhaps, more people, move in more people, but I think, in general the answer is no.
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: I would tell you that in n effort to maximize revenues and capture the best occupancy performance we can, we’re willing to trade-off on pricing as needed, but we’re very unwilling to trade off on credit quality to get there. 
Albert M. Campbell: And the results, you know, of net delinquency 0.5% of total net potential, you know, it would support that pretty strongly.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Turning to the portfolio activity, some folks have mentioned to me that maybe you are, have gotten in to, markets like Phoenix and what not, a little bit early given the projected downturn that’s still to come. How would you answer that criticism?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: I think that when markets are down, that’s when you want to be in there buying, honestly. I think the Edge at Lions Gate, the one we just bought, I mean we bought it on a basis of where we expect the market to be very weak for some period of time, and as long as you buy on those expectations and your model supports that kind of assumption and it’s still, at the end of the day, you believe capture and internal rate of return that is well in excess of our cost of capital, which is really what drives our decision, then we think it’s a good decision to make. And so we bought that property with the full knowledge that that market is going to be pretty weak, I don’t remember the specifics , we can get them for you, but I’m sure we‘re carrying pretty extensive vacancy assumptions and minimal and no rent growth for probably at least a couple of years.  So I think that that’s where some of the best buying opportunities in terms of your ability to buy at a discount to replacement value and to buy on a basis that’s going to drive a very attractive IR, you want to go into these distress situations, and as long as you understand that you’re going to have that kind of distress for awhile and dial that in your assumptions, it’s the right way to go.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: And just thinking about the timing of those recent purchases versus where you think your hurdle rates have moved, just given that your given pricing model, do you think that those projects would still pencil out given your new hurdle range?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: What we do is we take our cost of capital and then we put a safety cushion, if you will, on top of that, and so the answer is yes. I think that even with a cost of capital today versus where it was 60 days ago, I’m confident that it would still be in excess of our cost of capital in terms of the return we expect to capture.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Can you just help me understand your approach, your philosophy, around utilizing the controlled equity offering? I know in your prepared comments you had said that you’ve ceased that with the recent sell-off, but at what levels do you think you’d like to see your share price get to before you’d consider re-instituting that?
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: We obviously don’t disclose that, but clearly we’re very unhappy with the current stock price and when the stock did start to go, I mean, you can to some extent gather from the average price that we sold at, which is about $53.00 net-net net, that sort of says something about where we are willing at sell at. But I think a lot would have to do with what we see on the horizon in the way of deal potential and if we absorb a flurry of really knockout deals, then we would be much more prone to do something. But clearly at the current levels, where honestly, we’re trading, at the way we look at it, at about an 8% cap, about $61,000 a unit, we’re very reluctant to give away the company at that price. So it’s a bit of a long-winded answer, but you kind of get where we’re coming from.
Operator: Your next question comes from Carol Keller – Hilliard Lyons.
Carol Keller – Hilliard Lyons: On your recently acquired Brookhaven asset, how much did you pay for that?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: Sanctuary at Oglethorpe, you’re referring to?
Carol Keller – Hilliard Lyons: Yes.
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: $38.5 million.
Carol Keller – Hilliard Lyons: And what kind of renovations are you expecting to do on that and how much do you think that will cost?
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: It’s about $8,000.00 a unit, I think is what we’ve got scheduled over about three years, if I remember right.
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: What it starts with, frankly, is some upgrades to the amenities area, and the leasing center, and some of the common areas, and then, after the first year, our plan is to move into the unit interiors and after that, you know this is a property that is very, very well located half-way between Brookhaven and Buckhead, right across the street from Peachtree Golf Club, and every unit has a garage attached to it, so there’s huge floor plans, so we really think that the opportunity here is quite significant and we’ll get into the interiors in years two and three which will involve the counter-tops, the cabinetry, light fixtures, the faucets and things like that.
Carol Keller – Hilliard Lyons: What kind of rent are you charging on that asset now?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: Let us pull that information on that, we don’t have that handy right now in terms of the current rents at that property.
Carol Keller – Hilliard Lyons: But it’s probably much higher than some of your other assets.
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: Just that real estate alone, locations, that is far and away probably our highest rent per square foot in Atlanta.
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard Anderson – Investor Corp. Inc.
Richard Anderson – Investor Corp. Inc.: You didn’t say anything, I don’t believe I heard anything, about your Preferred H stock.
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: We put something in the press release about it. We believe we have no current plans to call that. And, so it is callable as you know, but we have no plans to do so.
Richard Anderson – Investor Corp. Inc.: I was wondering if you had considered at all buying any off the market with it selling about $20.00.
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: We have, and we don’t have any current plans to do that either.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rob Stevenson – Fox Pitt Kelton.
Rob Stevenson – Fox Pitt Kelton: Back to the Atlanta redevelopment asset, does it make sense, are the rents that you could get out of that now, still the bump, still great enough, that you would, in a weakening markets spend redevelopment dollars, or do you think that you just wind up postponing that and waiting until the market will drive, will accept higher rental rates, to warrant the investment?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: I man the way we do any of these redevelopment projects is we sort of test the market, particularly when we get into unit interiors, we will do a few units and make sure that we are getting the rent bump that we thought we would. Having said that, clearly if Atlanta continues to show weakness throughout next year or maybe even into the following year, and we don’t think we can get the rent bumps, then we’ll hold off. We’re not going to put the money out unless we think it wise.
Rob Stevenson – Fox Pitt Kelton: I know it varies from market to market, but call it a $750.00 average rent in the portfolio, what’s the gap between the cost of home ownership, especially something like foreclosed housing and the vast majority of markets relative that rental market rate?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: Obviously it does vary quite a bit by market, and in the Southeast, we frankly, single family housing has always been readily affordable, and the gap and between renting and owning has never been as significant as you see in some of the coastal markets, and so on average, the gap is a couple hundred bucks, maybe more than that, maybe $500.00. It will vary by market. But for us, quite honestly, in a region where single family housing has always been readily affordable, the pressure point for us over the last few years has been the ability for people, renters, to move into home ownership because they could do so, with no down payment, generally, with no established credit, per se, or maybe even weak credit, and the ability to secure financing to buy the home was really the driver. It wasn’t the pricing issue, it was just the ability to get the financing, and they didn’t have to come out of pocket for it. So that, of course, has now changed and the mortgage market is a little more disciplined about their lending practices and we think it will be that way for quite some time.
Rob Stevenson – Fox Pitt Kelton: What is the sort of max that Fannie and Freddie are currently out there lending on a LTV basis these days?
Albert M. Campbell: I think the max would be somewhere around 75%. That’s certainly not what we’re going for, but I think they can get that high for the right borrower. We typically are going for the 65% to 70% route.
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: And they might say it’s 80% but it would probably end up being 75%.
Albert M. Campbell: The underwriting is much more disciplined and the coverage ratios and those things are very tied on, so they may broadcast 80% and then work their way back to actually 75% on the proceeds.
Rob Stevenson – Fox Pitt Kelton: Given the type of buyers that you’re generally selling assets to, can they really make the numbers work at 75% LTV?
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: We’ve got four properties that we’ve got being marketed right now. One of them is, the buyer is using bank financing and I honestly don’t know what LTV he’s using, but the other three that we’re talking to are using Fannie and Freddie and, again I really don’t know the answer, but of the four properties, we’ve got three contracts actively working and two of them have said they’ve got their Freddie and Fannie financing sort of lined up, so.  But whether they’re at 75% or 65%, I don’t know, but I‘m assuming you’re right and that they’re probably right at 75%. Now, clearly as we said on the call, the disposition market is suffering from the same issues as the acquisition side of it and it’s not as easy as t was. There are fewer buyers but there are a lot of people out there looking for apartment real estate.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shelia McGrath - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
Shelia McGrath - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: I was wondering if you could discuss the long- term debt financing strategy? Are you still think that having the large facilities with Fannie and Freddie is the most efficient way to go?
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: Yes, we’re very sold on the facility as the way to go. I think the question we have to see going forward is whether that pricing that Fannie and Freddie are going to put on those facilities is going to be competitive.  I think we’ve also got to accept the fact that 2010 when we begin to think about the credit facility maturities that begin in 2011, we’ve got to revisit our refinancing strategy. And I think everything is on the table, because we don’t know what the new administration is going to do or what their attitude toward Fannie and Freddie is going to be. Clearly, we’ve seen Fannie’s and Freddie’s spreads widen and clearly, Al, I think you would say that their credit facility pricing has become relatively unattractive relative to single asset pricing.
Albert M. Campbell: Yes, it has. Mostly Treasury-plus financing is best for us right now. And I would also add to that, too, that in looking at our contracts, it’s important to remember we do have long-term contracts. We’re always looking at the best strategy for the company. Our contracts are long term, and if it becomes necessary to allow for an orderly exit, to find the right product, the right approach, and that’s the important to remember, I think.
Shelia McGrath - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: On percent of floating rate, what are you comfortable with now, looking into next year? What percent do you feel comfortable with left floating?
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: The strategy we have used is to have somewhere between a low of 10% and a high of 30%. We are right now at about 20%, give or take a percent floating, and I think we would probably feel pretty good about keeping it about that level. And obviously we’re going to be looking at that.  We’ve got probably $100.0 million of swap maturities next year, that we’ll be replacing. I think one comment I would say is that we’ve seen, Al has seen, that some of the Fannie and Freddie products with caps, as opposed to being just pure swapped debt, has become pretty attractive from a pricing standpoint. So, it may be next year, if we go with some financing in addition to our current facilities, if we were to find the need to do that, we might be looking at some floating products with caps. But, otherwise, I would look to keep it at 20%.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: The cap rates on those three Q3 transactions were?
Simon R. C. Wadsworth: The NOI yield was about 6.3% on those three transactions and that would put the cap rate at about 5.6%, something like that.
Michael Salinsky – RBC Capital Markets: Eric, one of your peers put a presentation on recently, suggesting negative growth next year. Now, just given what you’re seeing with the home ownership rates, job growth, I mean, do you think revenue growth was negative at this point or do you think you can hold in there at this point?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: I think, for our portfolio, collectively, we don’t think we’re looking at anything approaching negative growth next year in revenues. We believe that with the turnover continuing to show positive trends, with the mix of our markets that we have, as you know with a larger presence that a lot of others in the some of the secondary markets across the region, coupled with just absolutely, supply has just shut down, and we’re not seeing any pressure from that. We still had a little that came on early this year, as I mentioned in Jacksonville and Atlanta.  But on a macro basis, we don’t think we’re looking at anything similar to what we saw back in 2001 and 2002, the last time the market really took a stumble, and at that point, as you know, we were faced not only with job loss but we also had the pressure of move outs due to home buying as well. There was a lot of new supply coming onto the market.  We’re only battling the job growth trends at this point. And as I mentioned earlier we also don’t have the pressure from the excessive exposure to vacant homes and condos that some of the other markets that some of our peers have big presence in. So the answer is no. We think we’re going to hang in there on a positive note. We think occupancies are going to hold in there where we are right now. We think we’ll continue to capture positive pricing traction on lease renewals. We think as we go out and try to bring in new residents, the competition will be a little more intense and probably we’ll be looking at sort of flatish rent growth prospects for the new residents, the new leases we write, but on renewals they would be positive and occupancies will hold in there. We’re seeing a terrific performance on our collections and so everything that we look at, at this point, would suggest that slight positive trends, early part of 2009, and then by the time we get to Q3 and Q4 of next year, when we’re comparing against this year, I think the comparisons get to be quite a bit easier.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Radanovic – BB&T Capital Markets.
Steve Radanovic – BB&T Capital Markets: Just focusing back on expenses for a little bit, I know you had some unfavorable adjustments year over year. As you look into the next twelve months, are there any areas you think you could carve out some more expenses in light of what’s going to be some tough sledding here? Aare there any particular ongoing initiates you have ongoing right now?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: Certainly, yes. We’re taking a hard look at all our expenses right now, our operating and G&A, and I’m not prepared to give you any specifics on that right now, but some of the pressure that we saw this year on the operating expenses was in the area of personnel costs, which is kind of a good news/bad news story.  The good news is that our employee turnover went way down this year. We’re already below industry average and it went down significantly below that this year, and we’ve kind of seen that throughout the course of this year. That’s the good news. We’re holding on to our people and they’re better trained and we think this is a good time to hold on to good people.  The bad news is that we’re carrying a lot less vacant positions at any given time this year as compared to last year and so that created some pressure. Now, we don’t think our turnover will go even lower next year than where it is right now, because we are already incredibly low.  So I think that pressure point that we had this year will not repeat itself next year, and as you can imagine, personnel cost is a huge cost component of our operating structure. So that’s been a pressure point that we’ll moderate. And then beyond that we’ll just continue to trend down in resident turnover. That’s going to be hugely helpful as well. Obviously not turning apartments saves a lot of costs. So we’re continuing to take a hard look at all of our expense structure, recognizing that in a period of weaker top line growth, you need to find ways to cinch the belt up a little tighter.
Steve Radanovic – BB&T Capital Markets: As you look at it now, most of the low-hanging fruit you feel like has been taken care of, or you’re going to just to continue to look at each item and try to make improvements?
James Andrew Taylor: I would add there are a couple of specific initiative that we’ve got planned for 2009 that I think are going to add some value in terms of reducing costs. First would be an addition of a second screening partner for when we look at residents coming in the front door. Adding a second screening partner should save us around $300,000.  A second initiative that we’re looking at and plan to do in 2009 is to bring the calculation of our billing in-house with what is really called statement billing you’re starting to see with some other of the trusts, and it’s something we’re starting to look at as well. We think that has the potential to save us something on the order of $650,000 annually. You know right now, we’re use Vista to do all of our utility billing. We’re looking at bringing that in-house, considering that. I think that has some real potential there.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for participating in the Mid-America Apartment Communities second quarter earnings release conference call. The company will first share its prepared comments followed by a question-and-answer session. At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Director of External Reporting. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin.
Leslie Wolfgang: Thank you, Devon, and good morning, everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Director of External Reporting for Mid-America Apartment Communities. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Simon Wadsworth, our CFO; Al Campbell, Treasurer; Tom Grimes, Director of Property Management; and Drew Taylor, Director of Asset Management. Before we begin, I want to point out that as part of the discussion this morning, company management will make forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34-X filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call can be found on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Leslie. Mid-America's strong 13% growth in FFO during the second quarter was a result of solid operating performance and favorable financing costs. The quarter's FFO performance of $0.95 per share is the best result we have ever posted for a second quarter in our company's history. Mid-America's steady performance and growth in FFO is the result of several attributes that cause us to feel comfortable that performance will continue to hold up well despite pressure from a weak employment market. Let me recap a few reasons why we remain comfortable with our positive outlook for 2008 and are optimistic about leasing fundamentals long-term. First, as the economy regains footing, the Sunbelt region is going to capture strong growth in new jobs and household formations. Over the long haul, we believe the Sunbelt markets will outperform other new regions in creating demand for apartment housing. In addition, our strategy of allocating a portion of Mid-America's portfolio to more stable income markets within this high growth region provides a level of protection to broad economic slowdowns that will help insulate our NOI performance from severe strain during weak parts of the economic cycle. And of course Mid-America's lack of portfolio concentration in markets most pressured by vacant condos and single-family housing, also, goes a long way in ensuring that portfolio will hold up better than most during the current cycle. Secondly, the strength of our operating platform will help to ensure that Mid-America's portfolio continues to generate solid performance. We're confident that our yield management system implemented last year, recent changes in programs for collecting delinquent rent and upgrades made at the start of the year to our inventory management programs were all combined to deliver results that outperform market norms. As an example you'll note that same-store physical occupancy at quarter end was down slightly by 30 basis points in the second quarter, as compared to the same point last year, but effective occupancy which is the more meaningful measurement of vacancy loss as it accounts for a vacancy from turnover that occurs during the month actually improved by 64 basis points in the second quarter. As a result of this increase in the effective occupancy, same-store vacancy loss declined by nearly 9% in the second quarter as compared to last year. This is the direct result of lower resident turnover and our proactive inventory management system, which reduced the number of day's vacancy to 24 days as compared to 29 days in the second quarter of last year. One of the other important attributes about Mid-America's performance that we have consistently worked to develop over the year is a revenue stream that is high quality and recurring in nature. Mid-America's funds from operations in 2008 is overwhelmingly driven by performance from recurring rental operation at 99% of FFO, as opposed to gains on sales of one-time up-front fees. During weak parts of the economic cycle, this is a particularly important feature to have. Not only does this high-quality revenue profile generate a level of profitability in a year of moderating leasing fundamentals but it of course provides a solid foundation for the future. The last important attribute that I will point out is strength of balance sheet enjoyed by Mid-America. We have one of the strongest dividends in fixed-charge coverage ratios in the sector in the sector. This puts us in a solid position to be more opportunistic in our management of asset sales and as well as in our pursuit of new growth opportunities without having the pressure of liquidity concerns and the volatility that can come from balance sheets that are not as well capitalized or those facing significant financing commitments for new development or material refinancing exposures. Given the solid portfolio and operating platform, Mid-America has emplace coupled with strength of balance sheet, we believe the company is in a very good position, and, of course, helping to offset some of the pressure from weaker job growth is lower turnover and the reduced pressure from residents leaving to buy a house. All indications are that the return to more disciplined practices for qualifying for single-family mortgage loans, such as a down payment and acceptable credit history are here to stay. So on balance, we believe leasing fundamentals in our portfolio are going to hold up well and remain confident that we will have another year of solid growth in NOI and FFO. As noted in our earnings release, we did experience some moderation in leasing traffic late in the second quarter. While isolated in nature and as you would expect associated with those markets facing the most moderation in job growth, we believe that the weaker traffic patterns will nevertheless impact our ability to achieve same-store pricing growth at a level that we had hoped for in the second half of this year. Given this pressure along with the belief that property taxes are likely going to come in higher than we had originally expected we are pulling back a little our same-store NOI growth assumptions for the year to a range of 3% to 3.5%. However, largely offsetting this adjustment is better than expected performance in interest and administrative expenses as compared to our earlier forecast. Simon is going to walk you through details of the moving pieces of our updated forecast, but the two key takeaway points in my opinion are these. Original expectations for pricing growth and same-store assumptions are now under some modest pressure as a result of continued weak job growth, but effective inventory management practices, lower interest rates, and lower administrative expenses are largely offsetting this pressure. And secondly, overall FFO guidance is generally intact with the midpoint right where we began the year with and 3% below the midpoint where we were at the end of the first quarter as a result of raising more equity than we had originally forecasted as buying opportunities improved. At the midpoint of guidance, our expectation for FFO growth this year represents a solid 6% growth over last year's strong performance. And this is being accomplished while at the same time taking actions that are dilutive to the current year to further strengthen the balance sheet and position the portfolio for more robust earnings in the future. As a reminder, we expect $0.15 of FFO dilution this year in lease-up and new development initiatives, as we continue to increase the quality of the portfolio and lay a foundation for future FFO growth. Frankly, we are excited about where the company is positioned and performance expectation for this year and the outlook for performance over the next couple of years is very encouraging. Our regional markets are poised to capture significant growth in demand over the next few years. New supply pressures remain muted and will be so for a while. We have $113 million of projects that are in lease-up or under construction that will become fully productive over the next year to 18 months and our redevelopment and unit interior upgrade projects continue to position the existing portfolio for more robust pricing performance. We remain very confident about the long-term prospects for solid internal performance and growth in FFO for Mid-America's shareholders. Of course, one of the benefits to the more challenging leasing and financing environment is that we're seeing an improved market for making acquisitions. The best buying opportunities at the moment are associated with new lease-up development, properties in those markets facing pressure from excessive vacant condo and single-family inventory and those properties are facing near term refinancing requirements. We closed on another acquisition yesterday, and currently have two other acquisition opportunities under contract. Our pipeline is very active. With additional capital raised today couple with the balance sheet capacity that we began the year with, Mid-America is in a terrific position to take advantage of the improving buyer's window. From what we are seeing in the transaction market, we don't expect a significant shift in cap rates as there continues to be ample evidence of investment capital focused on the sector and of course financing remains available for stabilized properties through both Fannie and Freddie. What makes us optimistic about the ability to secure more deals that meet our investment hurdles is that largely the capital that is now in the market on the both the equity and debt side is more disciplined than what we have been competing with over the last few years. Given our regional focus, excellent record of performance for seller's strong relationships and existing financing agreements that are in place, we are confident of our ability to successfully compete in this transaction environment. And I am going to turn the call over to Simon now. Simon?
Simon Wadsworth: Thanks, Eric. Second quarter FFO per share of $0.95 was at the midpoint of our guidance, 13% increase over the second quarter of last year. We reported a $0.01 per share gain of the sale of excess land in the second quarter last year. And without this the growth in FFO per share was 14%. The strong growth was driven by solid operating results and the continuation of the favorable interest rate environment. As you remember, we anticipated at the beginning of the second quarter raising $50 million of new common equity for all of 2008. We had already raised $15 million of this in the first quarter. And then in the second quarter, we not only raised the $35 million balance, but nearly another $30 million on top for year-to-date total of almost $80 million. The FFO dilution from this additional equity was about $0.01 per share in the second quarter. We'll discuss our equity needs with the Board later this month, but our current plan is to raise an additional $20 million in the second half of the year. Assuming this occurs, we will have FFO dilution for the second half of the year from the $50 million of additional equity of just over $0.02 a share. So while we were able to meet the midpoint of our second quarter guidance despite the $0.01 dilution from the incremental equity, we need to modify our full year guidance by $0.03 to take account of the incremental shares. The primary reason we sold equity this year, is that we believe we are entering a time when we will be able to make some attractive acquisitions such as the two properties under contract that Eric mentioned. Our objective is to grow net present value per share and after a long spell and finding acquisitions that are accretive to MPV has been very difficult, we are beginning to see a few more opportunities. We also think that the uncertainties and volatility in the capital markets make it a time to have a strong balance sheet. And the equity we've raised takes a debt plus preferred as a percent of market cap into the lowest, that is the best one-third of the apartment sector. Second quarter year-over-year same-store performance was reasonably solid, but not at the level we had anticipated. Some of our markets experienced softer demand. Walk-in traffic didn't seasonably build at the rate we'd regularly expect. By mid-June, we saw that May and June revenue growth was trending weaker than we had expected and walk-in traffic ended the quarter down 7% from the same quarter a year ago. Given the strength we have seen in the first four months, we were surprised that the slowdown occurred and then it turned out to be more than a one-month phenomenon. This impacted our ability to push rents and fees to the extent we anticipated. Expenses were also slightly above the level we projected, partly due to some personnel cost pressures and in late June, we increased our full year accrual rate for real estate taxes from 4.5% same-store increase to 5.5% as a result of continued aggressiveness from tax authorities. We have been pleased at our bad debt continues to drop with net delinquency down from 0.5% in Q2 last year to 0.4% of net potential rent. The number of skips and evicts was down 3% from the second quarter of last year and the number of people paying after the 15th of the month dropped by 4%. The same-store concession rate dropped from 2.7% to 1.3% of net potential rent as we migrate toward net effective pricing at most of our properties. We continue to see the number of our residents leaving us to buy a house drop from 31% of move-outs in the second quarter of '07 to 25% in the second quarter of this year, a 21% drop. The number of our residents left to rent a house continues to be insignificant, rising from 3% to 4% of move-outs. Quarterly turnover on an annual basis dropped from 67% to 65%. We are also pleased. we've seen a recovery in walk-in traffic in July, which is up 13% over June and the best month of this year and just about July of last year. The number of lease applications is up 38% over June, 16% over July of last year. Though we think it's prudent to moderate our same-store forecast growth rate for the rest of the year. Our new forecast with revenue growth of roughly 3% and NOI growth of 3% to 3.5% for the full year seems realistic and given everything that is going on in the economy pretty good performance. We had a very successful renewal of our property in casualty insurance on July 1st of this year with $1.3 million of annual savings, or 14% from the expiring policy. Much of this reduction was already included in our forecast of same-store NOI and the balance is more than offset by the projected increase in real estate taxes. We have targeted four properties for disposition totaling 990 units. They represent a cross-section of small market and older properties that no longer fit our objectives. They are likely to be the only properties we sell this year. We expect net proceeds of $40 million to $45 million from the sale and a sale cap rate in the 6.5% range. We executed the brokerage agreements in July and preliminary showings to prospective buyers have started. We completed the acquisition of one property in the second quarter, Providence of Brier Creek in Raleigh, Durham, which is one of the Top 10 fastest growing MSAs in the country. The property has numerous high-end features, is a great addition to our portfolio. We closed on one additional property yesterday, The Edge at Lyon's Gate a 312-unit property built in 2007, and located in the Chandler/Gilbert submarket in the Southeast Valley of Metro Phoenix, which will own on our balance sheet. This is the second property we own in Phoenix. We have two additional properties under contract and being evaluated. One in Atlanta, and one a busted condo deal in Tampa both of which we'd own 100%. Our redevelopment program continues to generate attractive returns with interior renovations on almost 2,000 apartments completed through the end of June. We plan to redevelop approximately 3,000 units this year at an average cost of $4,700 an apartment. In addition, we have six exterior repositioning projects scheduled for this year totaling $2 million. We underwrite these exterior projects to generate the same kind of returns for additional rental rates as for our interior renovations. The two new development projects Copper Ridge in Dallas and St. Augustine Phase II in Jacksonville are on schedule. Copper Ridge has started lease up and construction expected to be completed in October and St. Augustine is expected to start lease up this quarter with construction scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. NOI yields on the two projects are forecast to average 7.5%. Turning to the balance sheet, because of the equity we have raised, our leverage defined as debt plus preferred to total gross asset dropped by 240 basis points from June of 2007 to 56%. As a percentage of total market capitalization our debt gross preferred is 46% among the best in the sector and our fixed charge coverage continue to improve rising to 2.52 from 2.2 in the second quarter of 2007. At the end of the quarter, we had $309 million of unused pre-committed credit available under our agency and bank facilities of which $187 million is available under in place mortgages, and an additional $122 million is committed in our existing credit spreads. $265 million of this capacity is under long-term credit facility arrangements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which was committed spreads was set before the current credit crisis. Looking forward to 2009 and 2010, the only debt maturities that we have are some of our swaps and the annual renewal of our bank credit line. In other words, we are not looking for new funding for any maturities. Without any significant development to fund, we think we are in a strong position. Earlier in the quarter, we took care of some upcoming maturities and put in place $100 million of forward swaps locking an interest rates effective between May and December, all of them favorably priced. We benefit from the fact that 22% of our debt is floating rate, of which a quarter is capped mostly tied to very attractive Fannie Mae DMBS rates. As mentioned in the press release, we put on hold any plans to redeem the $155 million of our preferred H. Debt cost for moderately leveraged apartment buyers without existing credit arrangements are not too far different from where they were a year ago. As increased agency spreads are close to being offset by the 80 to 100 basis point reduction in the five to ten year treasury in the swap rates. While fundamentals for multifamily demand look very attractive over the next few years, it's pretty clear that new development will remain muted, this financing is tough to obtain since Fannie and Freddie don't finance developments and construction cost continue to rise, the latest data that I have seen suggests a 6% annual rate of increase. As a result of our reduced leverage from the equity raise and recent trends, we have taken the midpoint of our FFO forecast for 2008 down by $0.03 from the guidance given at the end of the first quarter back to our original beginning of year guidance of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. We have raised common equity earlier in the year and now anticipate having $50 million more than we previously planned, causing $0.03 per share of FFO dilution on a full year basis. We're now projecting same-store NOI growth in the range of 3% to 3.5%, with revenues growing about 3% and expense growth for the full year in a range of 2.5% to 3%. Remember in the second half of this year, we will have tougher comparisons because of the very favorable insurance renewal and real estate adjustments that contributed towards the negative expense growth in the back half of 2007. We have a few additional pieces of the forecast that are moving around. We've increased our full year forecast for same-store real estate tax expense to just over 5.5%. As mentioned about the increase from our prior accrual rate is not quite offset by the savings from our July 1 insurance renewal. Compared to our prior forecast, we have reduced the forecast to the midpoint of our full year NOI by $1.9 million. This reduction is more than offset by $1.2 million reduction in forecast interest expense resulting from lower rates. Together with $900,000 less G&A and property management cost. We expect about $0.035 of FFO dilution this year from the recent acquisition of Providence at Brier Creek and the property we purchased yesterday, The Edge at Lyon's Gate because they are both in lease-up. This is an addition to the $11.5 of dilution we're expecting from the existing development and lease-up properties. One final comment. In thinking about 2009, remember that all companies will be implementing SFAS 141R, a new accounting a standard which will require the certain costs that have been historically capitalized into the basis of acquisitions will be a current period expense and thus a deduction from FFO. In the case of Mid-America, we estimate this will reduce our reported FFO in 2009 by $0.05 to $0.06 per share at current level of acquisitions. To emphasize this will impact all public companies is not anything unique to Mid-America.
Eric Bolton: Thanks, Simon. Our strategy for Mid-America is framed around a goal delivering high risk-adjusted return to shareholders. We believe that goal is best accomplished with a structure focused on deploying capital in the high growth Sunbelt region where demand-side variables tend to not only weather economic downturns better but a region that will capture more robust job growth during periods of economic expansion. Long-term, the fundamentals that drive demand for apartment housing look very good. New development continues to be challenged in this environment and the threat of oversupply is not on the horizon as far as we can see. We believe Mid-America is in a terrific position. Our portfolio of high-quality properties strategically diversified across a high growth region with a very strong operating platform and experienced team in place, a material level of lease-up and new development properties to come on line over the next couple of years and a balance sheet that is very well positioned to support additional growth and move forward opportunistically puts the company in a strong position. Devon, that's all we have in the way of prepared comments and turn it over to you for any questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Michael Salinsky from RBC.
Michael Salinsky - RBC: Good morning, guys. Just given what you are seeing with the moderation right now and job growth across your markets and your experience in the Southeast markets, Eric, what is your gut feeling when conditions begin to improve? When do we start to pull out of this?
Eric Bolton: Mike, from our perspective, I think it is going to be late spring, summer of next year. I think mid-year next year, we start to see things pull out a little bit. We don't have the pressure from any sort of supply issues. I think it really is just the economy needs to get some traction and we need to get job growth back to where it was. Interestingly, the variable that obviously we look at that really I think is the one that is concerning us right now is traffic. And, I am going to turn it over to Tom. I'll let Tom to give you a little perspective on where we are seeing the traffic issues and why we think that things are going to get back on track mid-year next year. Tom?
Tom Grimes: All right, thanks Eric, and Mike, good morning. 70% of our traffic drop is really just tied to three areas which are Florida, Columbus, Georgia and Atlanta. And just sort of picking them off one by one, Florida, in general, no new press there. I will tell you Jacksonville has weakened a little bit materially with weakness in the financial sector hitting a little bit. They have had some job layoffs that sort of picked up around the second quarter, and they have got a little bit of new supply, but when you drop 7,000 jobs, any new supply isn't that helpful. In Columbus, we have seen a fallback on traffic, but that is sort of a pleasant story. Columbus has tightened up. We're advertising less, driving less traffic. It is holding up pretty well. And Atlanta is another place where job growth, if you just look at it, 70 basis point increases in job growth doesn't seem that bad, but it has moderated, its growth rate is cutting about in half. So it is still significantly over the national average, but we have seen some slowdown there a bit. The July numbers are encouraging. They have bounced back a bit, but I don't think we want to rally behind July and say job growth is back. Just our traffic picked up a little bit more along the lines of what we would expect.
Michael Salinsky - RBC: Okay. As a follow-up to that, Houston was a little softer than what had anticipated on sequential revenue bases. Was there any driver behind that one?
Tom Grimes: No, Houston and Dallas and Austin have all been just incredibly strong. We're just really dealing with a trade-off as we adjust on some renovates a bit and shouldn't be any major problem there. We are ramping up our renovate that creates a little bit more vacancy loss for a short period and then it rolls. We are still feeling good about Houston.
Michael Salinsky - RBC: Okay. Secondly, just in looking at the acquisition environment, I think you mentioned some additional opportunities there. Are you seeing more distressed sellers in the market? Are you seeing portfolios? Can you kind of shed some light on this? What opportunities you are seeing out there and also where pricing is right now relative to maybe six to 12 months ago?
Eric Bolton: Mike, this is Eric. Where we are seeing the best opportunities right now are really in three areas. We continue to find struggling lease-up, new development projects that are facing construction financing takeout requirements that are creating some pressure for the developers and they are becoming increasingly motivated to talk to us about pricing that makes sense to us. We are also seeing some pressure in some of these markets that are pretty soft from the overhanging of vacant condo and single-family homes such as Phoenix. We also are seeing some opportunities on some stabilized assets where they are facing some refinancing issues. Of course in a more stabilized asset area, the competition for buying those deals is still pretty fierce given that Fannie and Freddie will finance that whereas they won't finance the new development. So, overall, we are seeing the fairly new properties where you have got less than a stabilized situation where Fannie and Fred won't provide financing. That's where we are seeing the best buying opportunities at the moment. And in reference to our portfolio transactions, frankly, we are not really seeing a whole lot that we saw some earlier this year and looked at a number of deals that were pretty good-sized. And the kind of pricing that we were willing to talk to folks about, they weren't willing to talk to us about it at that point. I think that if fundamentals do continue to show some sluggishness and I think that if revenue growth does tend to moderate over the second half of this year, early next year as we think it will. I think some of these portfolios may start to come back around and pricing that makes sense to us. And frankly, I think that it's kind of hard to opine what sort of cap rate change has taken place. I would say that kind of gaze that we are seeing most people refer to is about a 50 basis point sort of shift up in cap rates. That sounds as reasonable to us as anything else I can point to. It's really kind of almost a case-by-case situation.
Michael Salinsky - RBC: And then, finally, the 6.5 cap rate you are looking for on the dispositions here in the second half of the year that's a little bit better than you have been anticipating on the prior calls. Is that related to mix? What's the driver behind that essentially?
Simon Wadsworth: I think frankly Mike a couple of properties are older properties and we are sort of selling here on a per unit basis, which kind of acts sort of a bit of a floor up price really, and I would agree that sort of more generally you would expect the properties that we are selling to be we have a few of them in the sort of six and a half to seven range rather than the six and a half range.
Michael Salinsky - RBC: Thanks, guys.
Simon Wadsworth: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon from Robert W. Baird.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Thank you and good morning.
Eric Bolton: Good morning.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Simon, can you just refresh my memory of what is the magnitude of the eclipse of the increase in the real estate tax over the insurance savings?
Simon Wadsworth: Al, do you want to talk about that?
Al Campbell: Yeah, I think the real estate tax as Simon mentioned was about 1% change, and I think that when you compare that to the change in insurance, I believe it's about $100,000 to $150,000 difference in that net offset if that is what you are asking.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Yes. That is exactly what I am asking, thanks. And then in terms of your plans to raise additional equity, will that again be through the controlled equity offering, if I look at the prospectus correctly, it looks like you are almost at the limit of the share count that was provided for in the agreement.
Al Campbell: That is exactly right, Paula. We did reach the limit of that, and we filed a new one on around the beginning of July so that we do have another authorization about another 1.350 million shares. So we are good to go, and we would plan to use the controlled equity offering, if we go ahead with that additional $20 million, which is in our forecast.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then lastly, could you just talk a little bit about the appetite that you are seeing of Fannie, Freddie to in fact increase their financing sourcing?
Simon Wadsworth: Well, what we have been seeing and I will let Al chime in, because he has been dealing with them on a pretty daily basis on sort of price quotes and things. They still seem very active, and they have been very committed to the sector. We have had price quotes from them very recently. Al, what kind of pricing are you seeing for our sort of Fund 1 kind of.
Al Campbell: Well, we are seeing depending on specifics of the property and the terms of those deals, we are seeing anywhere from 200 to 230 spread and across the yield curve that means a different total end rate and that's what we are seeing. All the facts that you are saying and we are seeing point to the factor they are definitely still committed to multifamily and have the capacity, they are certainly saying they are. And we are seeing the evidence to support that at this point.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Great, thanks very much, guys.
Al Campbell: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nap Overton from Morgan Keegan.
Nap Overton - Morgan Keegan: Good morning.
Simon Wadsworth: Hi, Nap.
Nap Overton - Morgan Keegan: Just a couple of things. Several of my questions have already been answered. You mentioned that you wouldn't want to call an improvement in leasing traffic in July and end to the weakness that you were thinking you were seeing in May and June. What would it take for you to be convinced that things were getting better?
Tom Grimes: Job growth to rebound I think, Nap. This is Tom. Nap, that's sort of the thing. It's been fairly isolated in terms of where the traffic is up, but we really just need to see job growth come back. Supplies and check, or six straight quarters of increased occupancy, either will make us feel better. I think, Nap, we were sort of a little bit surprised when we saw the weakness in traffic at the end of May and in June. And say July has recovered. I would want to see personally another month or two of recovery, yeah, to be convinced that we are back to where we originally thought we would be.
Nap Overton - Morgan Keegan: You are certainly not the only business seeing weakness in May and June.
Tom Grimes: No.
Nap Overton - Morgan Keegan: And then secondly, Simon, you mentioned in the press release you are negotiating expansion and expansion to the Freddie Mac credit agreement to fund 2009 growth plans. Would you care to share with us kind of a range of the volume or the size of that expansion that you might be thinking about to fund your 2009 growth plans?
Al Campbell: Nap, I think, I can give you some color, and it's Al. I think we are probably talking something in the $200 million range at this point. But I tell you given the funding requirements for remainder of this year, and going into next year, we have plenty of capacity and really are talking about putting that place mid to late next year just to continue our growth strategies at that point in time. We have plenty of capacity in our current facilities right, now certainly not this year's commitments and most if not all of next year's commitment.
Nap Overton - Morgan Keegan: I was just trying to back into how much acquisition volume you were planning.
Al Campbell: That's why I was being a little.
Drew Taylor:  Yeah. We are still planning that. But I think in our general sense, sort of our base case, if you like, on our balance sheet is still kind of in the $150 million, $200 million range this year and our base case next year is about $150 million. But I think that could get stepped up if we see what we think is going to happen, happened. And, of course, as Eric mentioned for our joint-venture, we call Fund 1, you know, we are finding it harder to make those deals happen just because there is a lot of investors who are attracted to this asset class and stabilized profits for the reasons that Eric mentioned. So we think that's a little tougher, but roughly we think our continued guidance, $150 million on our own account, $150 million in Fund 1 in a kind of a steady state basis is roughly where we are trending. There maybe a few opportunities in late this year, early next year that we may jump on.
Nap Overton - Morgan Keegan: Okay. And then, would you care to comment on the character of the three additional acquisitions that you have under contract? Are those repositioning? Are they lease-ups? Are they stabilized? Would you care to comment on what the characteristics of those are?
Eric Bolton: The other two that we are looking at, they are under contract right now, one has a repositioning component to it. The other is a busted condominium project. And we are still not closed on those. Probably shouldn't talk a lot more about either one of them, but both are opportunities that we feel very excited about and hopefully will get them closed.
Nap Overton - Morgan Keegan: Okay.
Simon Wadsworth:  The one we just closed on that The Edge at Lyon's Gate in Phoenix is pretty well brand-new property, on 85% leased.
Eric Bolton: That just finished last year. It's a terrific asset in a great area so we are really excited about what it is going to do. As we continue to look for ways to carefully expand in the Phoenix area.
Nap Overton - Morgan Keegan: And the dollar amount of that investment for that property was--?
Eric Bolton: $30,000 million roughly for that and the one we just first finished in the quarter.
Simon Wadsworth: So it's about $110 a unit, is that about right in Phoenix?
Eric Bolton: Yeah.
Nap Overton - Morgan Keegan: Okay. And then, just one last thing. How have you dealt we're talking about this six months ago and nine months ago? How have you dealt with qualifying credits for leasing for people coming into the renters market from having difficulties in the housing market? How have you determined to deal with that?
Drew Taylor: Hey, Matt, this is Drew. Really we haven't made any changes to the way we deal with mortgage defaults and our qualification process. What we have seen is really a very small percentage of our applicant pool have mortgage defaults on their credit records. So we really haven't done anything any differently. Our collection results continue to be good, and we really just haven't felt a need to make any change there.
Eric Bolton: Frankly, I think a lot of people that default on mortgages become renters of homes. I think a lot of it recycles within that sector.
Drew Taylor: And it's a thorny issue. Typically those folks have other problems with their credit and they are generally not going to qualify.
Nap Overton - Morgan Keegan: Okay. Thank you very much.
Eric Bolton: Thanks.
Simon Wadsworth: Thanks, Matt
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Kucera from BB&T Capital Markets.
Craig Kucera - BB&T Capital Markets: Yes. Hi, good morning.
Eric Bolton: Good morning.
Craig Kucera - BB&T Capital Markets: I just had a thought. You know on the legislation that passed this week that is going to effectively eliminate down payment assistance programs in October, I wanted to know if you had any opinion on how that impact your business, particularly as it relates to move outs and is any of that affecting your guidance maybe in regard to lower turnover assumptions or higher stickiness of your occupancy?
Eric Bolton: I do think that the single biggest issue for us and for turnover is you know people buying a house, the two things that we have been battling is the fact that people could do it without a down payment and they have to have good credit. That is not going to change. We do think it is likely that our turnover will continue to benefit from the tougher mortgage financing environment. You know, how much lower our turnover will go is really hard to predict. Frankly, we think that kind of where we are right now in terms of the turnover is probably we are assuming more or less we are going to hang at this level. The thing that really caused us to feel, some need to moderate our expectation a little bit was really just the leasing traffic and the job market concerns. That is obviously offset a little bit by this tougher mortgage financing environment to some degree, but it is not enough.
Simon Wadsworth: I think it means, as we have made and accommodated in other conference calls and investor presentations, I think for the long haul when you look at '09, '10 and '11, I think it's going be very good particularly for us. The primary factor is for somebody who leaves us is being able to get a down payment and bypassing that is a huge detriment to us. We feel very good about the long-term impact of what's going on.
Craig Kucera - BB&T Capital Markets: Great. I just want to follow up. I know that the yield on the Series H is like an 8.3%. It is trading at $0.95 on the dollar, something like that. Are you willing to talk at all about sort of the acquisition cap rates or yields that you are looking at relative to that and sort of your thought process as it relates to capital structures?
Simon Wadsworth: Sure. What we look at really is, what we think our long-term costs of equity is, and when we look at it, we use a dividend discount model and we look at our current yield plus long-term growth rate which we pegged right now at about 5.5%. So we are looking at our cost of equity in the 10% range or so with a hurdle rate about 20% above that and then you couple that with a cost of debt which new debt would be sort of 5.5% and 5.75% range right now. Put that together on a 50-50 basis to get a blended cost of what we think our cost of capital is and we compare that really to the preferred. So it is a little bit below our preferred cost. Now we are underwriting our new acquisitions to roughly today. This is a return, an IRR on equity in the sort of 12% to 12.5% range. So all in all, we think that's if you like the right way for us to go. We do think we have probably got maybe a little bit too much preferred on the balance sheet right now, but we are kind of reluctant to take it out because we would be giving up a free call option which we have got effectively now on the preferred and these are uncertain times in the capital markets and we think we are going into a window where we could really accrete MPV per share by making some really good, attractive acquisitions. So we are kind of reluctant to lose any firepower at the present time. That is the way we look at it really, Craig.
Craig Kucera - BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next, we have a follow-up from Michael Salinsky from RBC
Michael Salinsky - RBC: Good morning. Well, back on again actually. Just a couple of follow-up questions here. You revised your guidance assumptions for the investment funds here in the second half of the year from 150 previously to a range of 100 to 150. Is that related to asset mix what you are seeing in pricing or a pull back or any changes in the acquisition to manage your management joint venture partner. What was the driver behind that?
Eric Bolton: Mike, it's really just a function of the competitiveness of the market and trying to buy deals. Our JV partner remains every bit as committed as they were at the start. It really as just we think that the ability to get a couple more deals done this year is what we are hoping to. But it's a very competitive market out there, trying to buy these deals right now. That's what really caused us to pullback a little bit?
Michael Salinsky - RBC: Okay. And you also raised your real estate tax assumptions for the second of the year here. What were the regions that were responsible for that?
Simon Wadsworth: It is really, Mike, Texas has a lot to do with it. And then, Georgia is the other state that's been pretty tough, some counties in Georgia. But as is always, Texas is always a wildcard, and Texas and Georgia are the two areas giving us most problems.
Michael Salinsky - RBC: Are there any states coming in better than what you anticipated?
Eric Bolton: Yeah. As a matter of fact, Tennessee did, and that was very nice. And I think in Memphis, as a matter of fact. And we have had a little bit of pickup in North Carolina too that has helped us, but not enough to offset the current pressure in Texas and Georgia. Now, I will say that until we get through the third quarter, we are dealing with a kind of a really volatile sort of tax situation. As we have said in the past, 1% of our real estate taxes is about a $0.01 a share. Just over $0.01 a share, so it's not just a killer issue, but until we get through the third quarter things will still stay a little murky. I am optimistic that we may do a little better than the 5.5 now, but I could change my view tomorrow what if we get more e-mails in from our various consultants out there that are fighting these reappraisals for us.
Michael Salinsky - RBC: And then finally just a theoretical question, you have acquired a lot of newer properties in the market over the last couple of years here. You also have a steady stream of properties you have owned for quite some time, maybe B or B+ in the market, and what are you seeing among the traffic trends at the As, the higher end properties versus maybe some of the lower end properties that you have across the portfolio?
Eric Bolton: Mike, it splits more by market. There is more correlation to market trends than they are to class trends at this point. So, not a huge difference between the two.
Michael Salinsky - RBC: So you haven't seen any trading down from the A to Bs as job growth slows or anything like that?
Eric Bolton: Not that the point, like I said it tends to be, if Jacksonville slow, it will slow across all classes. If Houston is strong, it is strong across all.
Michael Salinsky - RBC: Great, thanks.
Operator: And our final question comes from Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Good morning, guys.
Eric Bolton: Hi, Rich.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Sorry, I am a little bit lagging, I got in a little bit late on the call, but I do have a big-picture question for you. You are seeing some slowdown in your internal growth prospects. But what do you think of your overall portfolio and your markets, what sort of the long-term average is in terms of your ability to grow from internal sources. Do you think you are there now or do you still think you are above that average?
Eric Bolton: Rich, I will tell that you I think what we think is going to happen as this economy starts to regain some footing that it's likely that our internal growth rate is better frankly than where it is right now, because we do believe that given a recovering economy and recovering job performance, without the supply side pressure because we are not seeing that right now and we are not going to see it for a while. I think we are going to enjoy a couple of years or so, where just the macro dynamics are such that we are going to see some pretty good performance. And you throw on top of that all the renovation work that we have been executing on for the last couple of years and the higher rent growth prospects that we are going to get out of that. I think on top of sort of these market dynamics, you have got that variable at play. So it kind of goes back to the point I made in my prepared comments. We feel pretty dam good about where the portfolio is right now. We think we are heading into starting really next year into 2010. We are going to be in a really good window. And we like the position of portfolio.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Yeah, and I can recall our conversation and you alluded to this also in the call already, but in terms of real estate taxes, do you think you now have now captured whatever increase you might see this year, or is there a possibility somehow that could still trend up on you during the second part of the year?
Drew Taylor: Rich, I think we have captured it. Nothing is for certain, but I am probably 80% sure that we have captured it at this point.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Isn't there like a July 1st sort of.
Drew Taylor: It really September 30th.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  September 30th?
Drew Taylor: Yeah. And it's really a third quarter thing, but I am feeling pretty good about where that will be. We're failure crew, we're maybe just marginally over a crew, but it's going to be very module on that as it does change daily. One other comment I will just make, Rich, and that is going back to your first point and this is something I have sort of harp on a bit, but during the last 10 years, we lost $5 million people out of rental pool, 5 million households out of the rental pool. And with this what's going on in the economy. Those 5 million households I truly believe are going to come back to the rental pool over the next five years, or 10 years and I think that bodes very good for the business that we are in along with the eco boomers that people talk about. So I think we are very well-positioned and particularly in the markets that we are. So I think we've got a good two tore three years ahead of us.
Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets:  Okay, sounds good. Thank you.
Operator: I would like to turn the conference over to our moderator for a wrap up.
Eric Bolton: Okay, we really don't have any other comments. We appreciate you being on the call this morning. And obviously if you got any other follow-up questions, give us a call. Thank you.
Simon Wadsworth: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-05-02 10:15:00) =====
Executives:  Leslie Wolfgang - Director External Reporting Eric Bolton - CEO Simon Wadsworth - CFO Al Campbell – Treasurer Tom Grimes – Director Property Management Drew Taylor – Director Asset Management
Analysts:  David Cohen - Morgan Stanley [Steve Radanovich] – BB&T Capital Markets Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets  Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets Sheila McGrath - Keefe, Keegan & Company Andy McCulloch - Green Street Advisors
Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for participating in the Mid-America Apartment Communities first quarter earnings release conference call. The company will first share its prepared comments followed by a question and answer session. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Director of External Reporting. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin.
Leslie Wolfgang: Good morning everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Director of External Reporting for Mid-America Apartment Communities. With me this morning are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Simon Wadsworth, our CFO; Al Campbell, Treasurer; Tom Grimes, Director of Property Management; and Drew Taylor, Director of Asset Management. Before we begin I want to point out that as part of the discussion this morning company management will make forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-X filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call can be found on our website. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Leslie and thanks for calling into our first quarter earnings call. As outlined in yesterday’s release Mid-America is off to a terrific start in 2008. Strong first quarter results support our belief that the company is poised to deliver another year of solid performance. Within our markets and portfolio, the steady employment conditions, minimal new construction starts and a lack of pressure from vacant single-family and condo product drives our expectation for steady NOI and FFO growth this year and into 2009. Employment trends in those markets where we have higher concentration, such as Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, Jacksonville and Memphis, continue to show positive job growth trends and overall steady employment conditions. While the research we all read supports that job growth is indeed slowing from last year’s growth rate, we continue to believe that the employment levels in our markets are likely to hold up pretty well and at this point we don’t see any evidence developing for significant job loss. From what we’re seeing in our leasing offices and submarkets, indications are the leasing environment will remain stable as we head into the busy summer leasing season.  Of course to some degree demand levels are also being supported by the pull-back in single-family home buying. Its hard to tell how much of the slowdown in job growth is being offset by the pull-back in home buying but there’s clearly some offset and I expect it will very significantly by market across the country. Further supporting what we expect to be continued net positive absorption trends is the pull-back by developers in starting new projects. Most of the developers we talk to are clearly having a difficult time securing financing and also having a real challenge in making their numbers work when they can secure financing.  I continue to believe that the necessary components are not in place to support any sort of significant ramp-up in new development activity across our markets and expect that it will remain so for some time. Now if one wants to forecast a more severe slowdown in the economy and a meaningful deterioration in employment levels as the year unfolds, we continue to believe that overall the apartment business will avoid the severe collapse that occurred in the 2002 2003 timeframe. The lack of new construction pressure and the return to a more disciplined mortgage financing market will provide some continued relief unlike the 2002 2003 downturn.  As you may recall Mid-America’s regional focus and diversification held up as one of the stronger performers during this period of very weak fundamentals for the apartment business. So while some moderation in job growth is occurring there are other cross-currents at work to keep us comfortable that leasing fundamentals within our portfolio are in pretty good shape as we head into the busy leasing quarters of Q2 and Q3.  Looking more specifically at some of the performance trends in Q1 total walk-in leasing traffic was up 3% over last year’s strong performance. We continue to see an explosion in the growth rate of folks initiating contact with us through the internet and via email. Traffic in these two areas more than doubled from Q1 last year and now represents close to 40% of our total traffic. We expect this trend to grow with long-term positive implications to our leasing and marketing cost efficiency. With the volume of leasing traffic running higher than last year and closing ratios strong, the average days to lease vacant units across the portfolio declined to 15 days in Q1, down from 19 days in the first quarter of last year. That’s a pretty meaningful metric and has positive implications for improving year-over-year effective occupancy and lowering vacancy loss. In addition to these positive front-door trends for the third consecutive quarter we saw move-outs due to home buying post a decline as compared to the prior year. Turnover attributed to buying a home declined by 16% in Q1 versus last year. Additionally move-outs to rent a home only increased by 3% or an insignificant 4% of all move-outs as compared to last year. We remain comfortable that Mid-America’s portfolio is not materially exposed to the shadow market of vacant single-family homes and condos that are pressuring apartment fundamentals in a number of markets across the country. With traffic and demand levels running higher than last year same-store physical occupancy at the end of the first quarter was a very healthy 95.6%, 70 basis points higher than the same point in 2007 and up 80 basis points from year-end. We expect to see this trend continue; in fact we closed April with same-store occupancy ahead of last year by 65 basis points at a strong 95.3%. In addition to the solid occupancy result in Q1 leasing concessions declined by a significant 46% and helped to drive effective pricing on a same-store basis, up 2.6% over the prior year. Our property management operation continues to become increasingly knowledgeable in using our new yield management program and we have been very pleased with the ability to more actively manage pricing and revenue management decisions on site. Another area of performance that we have been closely monitoring for any signs of weakness is collections. And again not only do we see, we saw no indication of performance deterioration in this area and in fact overall performance on net collection loss improved in the first quarter as compared to last year. Current month, uncollected rents held steady in Q1 as compared to last year at 1.1% of total net potential rent. However as a result of additional system enhancements and procedural changes recently introduced the recovery of prior month collections and collection agency recoveries improved a significant 28% over last year and as a result our total net collection loss in Q1 improved to just four-tenths of one percent in the first quarter, which is down from five-tenths of one percent last year. This result marks another quarterly performance record achieved in Q1. In fact it’s the strongest net collections performance we’ve captured in our 14-year history and is another example of an area where retooled systems and practices have made a significant positive impact to our performance.  So with occupancy running ahead of last year’s strong performance and pricing power intact and no signs of deterioration in collections we continue to feel pretty good about our expectations for another solid year of performance. Simon will provide additional insights on our updated earnings guidance for the year. But in addition to the overall stable leasing environment we continue to capture positive momentum from several new enhancements with our operating systems including the recent rollout of a new purchase order system and expanded capabilities for on site operations to more actively manage their expenses, also our kitchen and bath upgrade initiative has continued to capture terrific results and is making great progress and steadily penetrating a higher percentage of the portfolio. In the first quarter our renovation team completed just over 800 units, capturing an average price increase of 12% on the renovated units. Our guidance this year was based on completing a total of 3,000 units so we’re clearly off to a great start against this goal. On the transactions front, there are some changes starting to take place. From what we are seeing sellers are slowly starting to recalibrate their expectations. More distressed situations such as a leased up property or high leverage deals facing refinancing, offer better opportunities for those who can execute a close quickly and close without financing contingencies. The competition for value-add or repositioning investment opportunities where the buyer can get a little more creative or aggressive with their underwriting remains very competitive and pricing is holding up pretty well. Assuming the operating fundamentals continue to be good, we don’t expect to see any sort of significant shift in overall pricing but the number of distressed situations brought on by financing issues is growing and we believe that buying opportunities are increasing. Our goal for the year of adding $150 million of high quality properties on a 100% owned basis to our balance sheet is off to a good start with $23 million completed to-date. We currently have a new lease-up property in the Raleigh market that is undergoing due diligence and we expect to close on this acquisition later this month. We are also very active in underwriting acquisitions for our joint venture; Mid-America Fund 1, with a focus on repositioning investment opportunities. In the first quarter we closed on two investments for $60 million for the Fund and are on track to also capture our goal of $150 million of JV investments this year as well.  And with that, I’ll now turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Wadsworth: Thanks Eric. First quarter FFO per share of $0.96 was $0.04 ahead of the mid point of our guidance and a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2007. Excluding the $0.04 per share promote fee from the [pro] joint venture that we reported in the same quarter last year, the growth in FFO per share was 16%. The strong growth was driven by excellent operating results and a 40 basis point reduction in our average interest rates.  First quarter year-over-year same-store revenue growth was 3.8% slightly ahead of our internal forecast. NOI growth was 5% which compares favorably to the 4.3% growth we reported a year ago and other than the first quarter of 2006, is the best first quarter we have reported in the last 12 years. Fee revenues and reimbursements continue to climb more rapidly than rent of 6.9% and 7.2% respectively, as we continue to grow fees and fine tune our reimbursement collection procedures. All of these contributed towards excellent revenue performance. Same-store expenses increased 2.1% over the first quarter of 2007. This was a little higher than we’d forecast partly due to the timing of some personnel costs that we expect to moderate during the year. Increasing utility costs were partially recovered through our rebilling programs and repair and maintenance and marketing expenses had some modest reductions which helped to offset some of the cost increases.  Same-store results included 5% revenue growth and 7.9% NOI growth in our high-growth markets with strong revenue performance in Dallas, Houston and Nashville and strong overall performance in most of our other markets. Florida is the only significant area which has shown any weakness but even there, revenues increased 0.8% over the same quarter a year ago.  Our portfolio is well positioned for the current Florida market conditions as we have very limited exposure to markets that are over supplied with condos and single-family houses. We only have one property in south Florida, one in Orlando and four in Tampa of which two are in protected submarkets. Our biggest Florida concentration is in Jacksonville, which has performed well and where we have just one property, Lighthouse Court that is experiencing tough competition from single-family housing. Excluding this property Jacksonville property revenues were up 2.1%.  Overall we expect positive revenue growth from Florida for all of 2008. In Columbus, Georgia revenues at our two properties dropped 3% but we expect to recover as the year progresses. NOI in our three Texas markets is up by 11% and by 12% in our northern Tennessee and Kentucky markets. The strength of the markets and the implementation of the yield management software enabled us to reduce concessions in the first quarter on a cash basis by more than 50%, from $370 per movement a year ago to $179 this year, down from 2.6% of net potential rent to 1.2% which is likely now approaching stabilized levels.  We were pleased with turnover decrease of 1.6% compared to the same period a year ago from 54.1% on an annualized basis to 52.5%. Turnover is generally lower during the first quarter of the year so on a trailing 12-month basis it is 63.6%. As Eric mentioned the number of people leaving us to buy a house continued to decline, dropping 16% to 25.5% of move-outs from 29.3% in the first quarter of 2007. Turning to the balance sheet our leverage, defined as debt plus preferred to gross assets, dropped by 40 basis points from March of last year to 58.5%. As a percentage of total market capitalization our debt plus preferred stands at the sector median; 48.5% and our fixed charge coverage continued to improve rising to 2.4 from 2.22 in the first quarter of 2007. We have $280 million of unused pre-committed credit under our agency and bank facilities of which $160 million is available under in-place mortgages and an additional $120 million is committed to our existing credit spreads. We benefited as treasury and swap rates have dropped and as agency debt securities have traded very favorably compared to LIBOR. We have $180 million of debt refinancing and swap maturities to address in 2008 of which we completed $27 million in the first quarter. Since quarter-end we have now put in place a further $100 million of forward swaps locking in attractive interest rates that will be effective between May and December. We will be working on refinancing the remaining $50 million of maturities using our Fannie May and Freddie Mac credit facilities. As a result we expect to pick up interest savings beginning in the third quarter which is in both our original and our current guidance. We continue to benefit from the fact that 20% of our debt is floating rate including the 4% that’s capped, mostly tied to very attractive Fannie May DMBS rates. We have sold 300,000 shares raising $15.5 million net of new common equity in the first quarter through our continuous equity program. In April we sold an additional 350,000 shares raising $18.4 million net. So we netted about $52.14 a share. We will either use this equity together with some debt to repurchase some of the preferred which will lower our blended cost of capital or if the acquisition environment continues to improve as we think it may, we will use the equity to fund additional new investment. In either case we anticipate leaving some of the preferred in place with affectively a free call option to use if we choose at some future date. As a reminder if we do take out some of the preferred H, we have to write-off the original issuance cost of non-cash cost. This works out to be just over $0.01 per share for each $10 million that we redeem. Because of our strong first quarter we’ve added $0.03 to our full FFO forecast taking the range to $3.68 to $3.88 per share. Our guidance for the remaining three quarters which we’ve outlined in the press release remains very close to our original forecast.  We continue to expect property operations to perform in line with our initial 2008 forecast with same-store NOI growth in the range of 4% to 5%, revenues growth 3.5% to 4.5% and expense growth for the full year in a range of 2.5% to 3%. Remembering in the second half of the year we will have some tough expense comparisons because of the favorable insurance renewal on July 1 of last year and the favorable real estate tax adjustments in the second half of last year. We do have a few pieces of the forecast that are moving around. We have increased our forecast for same-store real estate tax expense to just over 4.5%. This is almost offset by our expectation of moderation from our July insurance renewal that’s coming up. Taxes are always one of our biggest areas of uncertainly at least until we get greater clarity towards the end of the third quarter. A 1% change in taxes impacts our results just over $0.01 per share. We are now hopeful of a flat renewal of our insurance program on July 1 and we’ll be pretty focused on this over the next couple of months.  Compared to our original forecast, lower short-term interest rates continue to help us although longer term interest rates have moved up. For the full year we expect interest rates to average 5% to 5.1%. We also will have slight FFO dilution from raising the additional equity that I mentioned. Our new guidance assumes we’ll sell and additional 300,000 shares during the balance of this year and the net of all of this adds $0.02 to 2008 FFO. We now expect about $0.03 of FFO dilution this year from the likely acquisition of the Raleigh property that Eric mentioned because it’s in lease-up.  Combining these items with the $0.04 that we beat our Q1 forecast gives us a $0.03 addition to the mid point of our full year guidance. We preliminarily identified our disposition candidates and subject to approval by our Board we anticipate starting the marketing process in the next 90 days. We think our prior guidance for acquisitions both of Fund 1 and for our wholly-owned account and for dispositions seems approximately correct.
Eric Bolton: Thanks Simon. We continue to believe that our disciplined value oriented approach to deploying capital diversified in high-growth markets across the Sunbelt region, supported by a culture that is passionate and our focus on property operations will continue to deliver performance that competes favorably with those strategies focused on high [barrier] markets and large new development operations. Over the last few years we’ve made a lot of changes to our portfolio profile, operating platform and balance sheet all of which continue to deliver record levels of performance from Mid-America. We believe that at times like these when strategies and platforms are challenged with a more difficult part of the credit cycle and concerns about moderating market fundamentals, those companies with a history of disciplined investment practices and a strong operating platform are at their most competitive.  This is also a time when a value buyer and a disciplined investor are presented with more opportunities. We built a platform that we believe will create a lot of long-term value for shareholders and we are working hard to leverage the platform with additional assets. We have several new growth initiatives teed up and a platform that is well prepared to execute. We look forward to another year of good results and are enthused about the foundation we continue to build for long-term value growth for our shareholders.  That’s all of our prepared comments, so operator we will turn it back to you for any questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from David Cohen - Morgan Stanley
David Cohen - Morgan Stanley: You talked about the turnover declining and you have fewer move-outs due to home purchases and you have more people coming in I guess due to foreclosures and stuff, but your turnover actually declined not that much, and I guess my question is are there other reasons that are increasing in terms of, this turnover is not down that much, but you’re talking about the turnover coming down for other reason so are there other reasons other than homes that are increasing to keep this turnover ratio kind of relatively steady? 
Unidentified Company Representative: Sure David and we’re, just for the quarter, looking at only quarter year-to-date we had 148 fewer move-ins, 225 of those were by homes and really the point that had the largest increase was rent increase at 97 offsetting that and frankly that’s a metric we’re willing to stomach a little bit. We’ll gladly trade fewer move-outs to home buying for half as many move-outs for rent increases as we push that.
David Cohen - Morgan Stanley: So they’re just moving to other apartments that are cheaper?
Unidentified Company Representative: I don’t have an answer for you on where they’re going from here when we raise the rents.
David Cohen - Morgan Stanley: Okay and then you talked about a lot fewer new developments and other developers not being able to get financing, does that leave opportunity for you to do more development or are you similarly as cautious about new development?
Eric Bolton: We’ve always been pretty cautious frankly about new development. We are seeing more interest particularly from developers that either have projects teed up or they’re in the middle of lease-up and they are worried about their take-out financing and we are being approached a lot more actively on that front. I don’t think you will see Mid-America, well you won’t I can tell you, you won’t see us jump into new development in a big way but we are starting to see a lot more opportunities for some very attractive properties in great markets that we’d like to be in where people are coming to us saying, look we’re worried about our financing or we can’t get the financing and so let’s talk and so that’s, like the deal in Raleigh we just mentioned and the deal in Houston we bought at the very start of the year, we are seeing a lot more in that area. 
David Cohen - Morgan Stanley: So would you likely jump in as kind of an equity partner or would you do kind of a [mez] with the possibility of loan-to-own type of…?
Eric Bolton: We would do it straight up as the owner, as the equity and it would be a situation where we would come in and just provide the take-out or provide the, we would just go in and buy it in the middle of lease-up like the deal in Raleigh. We’re not really interested in going in as some sort of [mez] lender and all that kind of stuff. 
Simon Wadsworth: We have done a couple of deals and probably will do some more where we have gone in on a fixed price contract with a developer on a ground-up development and for Brier Creek Phase 2 was one of those. We have one of those going on with Copper Ridge right now which is a phase 2 also. So we’ll probably continue to look for those opportunities and you’re right, there may be some more of those opportunities, particularly when we can come in on a value add basis to take advantage of the situation. 
David Cohen - Morgan Stanley:  And can just review the $0.01 difference in the $0.03 guidance you kind of reviewed some dilution from the equity issuance and then you had lower short-term rates, can you just kind of review those pieces again?
Al Campbell: As Simon mentioned the first portion of that is just the $0.04 in the first quarter. I think he mentioned the quarter, the color on that really is strong operations for the year, mainly interest expense and some G&A being a little less than we expected. But then on top of that, the yield curb has changed since our previous forecast and we have about a 20 basis points reduction in our average borrowing cost projected for 2008 so if you do the math on that, that’ll give you about another $0.06 for the year. And then you have offsetting obviously the equity that Simon talked about, the limited equity that we are issuing this year and also the $0.03 on a lease-up property in Raleigh that Simon talked about. So if you add all that down you get to a mid-point that’s about $0.03 higher than the guidance from the previous quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from [Steve Radanovich] – BB&T Capital Markets
[Steve Radanovich] – BB&T Capital Markets:  You touched on dispositions I guess there were no sales in the quarter, can you give us a little more detail on what the timing is on the roughly $60 million you do have targeted?
Eric Bolton: We will be talking with our Board about our plans on that in another couple of weeks at our meeting and I would expect that we will start to the marketing of those properties in early Q3, late Q2 and get them done by year-end we expect.
[Steve Radanovich] – BB&T Capital Markets:  So more late third quarter or fourth quarter events.
Eric Bolton: Yes.
[Steve Radanovich] – BB&T Capital Markets: In general can you comment on the cap rate environment in your markets, one of your coastal peers commented that they’ve been seeing cap rates back up anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points, what are you seeing in your primary markets?
Eric Bolton: It’s hard to give you a real fix on cap rates with any real certainty. For sure transaction volume really fell off there for awhile and it’s just now starting to show any sort of movement so it’s hard to give you a real sense on that. I will tell you that operating results and NOIs are holding up pretty well so we continue to believe that if you see any sort of moderation really start to take hold in cap rates that to some degree the improving operating, or continued growth in NOIs will offset it to some degree. But clearly the high leverage buyer and the condo converter out of the market at this point and so that capital is out of the environment but there continues to be a lot of equity out there looking to deploy in the multi family space and so at least what we’re seeing, prices are holding pretty firmly.  Probably the only real thing I could point to is that we are seeing that some of those sellers that are really being impacted by the financing environment, the developers or those that have put together pretty high leveraged deals over the last several years that are now facing some refinancing pressure, I think that that’s where you’re going to start to see the biggest opportunities but having said that, particularly on the value add deals, that’s where we’re seeing a lot of capital still actively chasing opportunities where capital can go in and put a repositioning story on their underwriting. You can get pretty aggressive still with the underwriting assumptions and so the [inaudible] spread if you will in those areas is still pretty tight. I would tell you that just in an effort to kind of give you some sense of it I would tell you that cap rates may be moved 10 basis points on really sort of the value add stuff and we think that on some of the more opportunistic plays where sellers are facing some financing risks that somewhere upwards close to 50 basis points spread in cap rates may be taking place but not a whole lot of movement to be honest with you.
[Steve Radanovich] – BB&T Capital Markets: And then lastly just back on Jacksonville I know you said taking out the one Lighthouse property you see revenues up 2.1%, what is rent growth looking like if you took that property out. Is it still pretty good, is it still around 2% or is there some weakness in that market in Jacksonville?
Unidentified Company Representative: It’s primarily that. Rent growth I think with it was 0.07% and that property is holding us back a little bit on rent growth.
Eric Bolton: To give you some sense of sort of what Florida is in general means overall our effective pricing performance was 2.6% up. You take the Florida properties out of the equation; total effective pricing growth was…
Unidentified Company Representative: …33 so Florida is sort of the anchor on overall growth. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets
Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: With regard to Fannie and Freddie can you just update us on what you’re hearing from them in terms of their willingness to lend, spreads just what you’re hearing from the lenders?
Al Campbell: As you know we’ve had a relationship with really both agencies for a long time as that’s been our primary borrowing platform for some years. We talked to both, been at their offices over the last few months and we really expect that they’ll continue to be very committed to both the multi family industry and us, Mid-America because of our relationship and really the key to that is as you think about it lending to multi family meets their charter and right now in these tough times its not only a profitable part of their business but its also a very low risk part of their business. So that we expect them to continue to be committed and we’re hearing that they’ve got the capacity they need and they’re going to be committed to the industry and especially the people who have relationships with them.
Simon Wadsworth: And of course obviously as everybody has said spreads are widening but absolute, because of the absolute drop in treasury and swap rates on a year-over-year basis has helped a lot but still the spreads widening, probably the overall borrowing cost compared to a year ago on a seven or 10 year is probably up about 20 or 30 basis points or something like that.
Al Campbell: Just a little color, I think for many weeks there I think both agencies have meetings each week to look at their current spreads and I think for a while there the spreads were going up between five and 10 basis points every week. I think we’re hearing now, they’re obviously at a much higher level then they were but they’re starting to stop and hopefully maintain or come back in the future so we’ll see how that plays out.
Simon Wadsworth: So for moderate level borrowers like us, we feel we’re in pretty good shape. 
Al Campbell: And also if you think about as Simon mentioned we have about $250 million of capacity from agencies that we have the historic credit rates locked in on from our credit facilities that mature between 2011 and 2018 so we feel pretty good about that too. 
Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: The asset you added to the joint venture fund in late March what was the cap rate on that?
Eric Bolton: I can tell you of course this is a repositioning deal so we don’t really get that focused on the ingoing cap rate.
Simon Wadsworth: The ingoing cap rate was 5 ¾.
Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: In terms of your redevelopments you had pretty good activity there in the first quarter is there a possibility for upside to that later in the year?
Drew Taylor: Typically we expect to do 20% or so in the first quarter, we did a little bit, 20% of our total units that we planned for the year in the first quarter. We planned 3,000 units this year we did 800 so we’re a little ahead of pace there. The program, the production is good; the acceptance is good, we’re seeing the 12% rent increases that we sort of expect in the program so the appetite for the apartments continues to be good. So we’ll do 20%, we did slightly more than 20% in the first quarter we’ll do, we’ll ramp that up as turnover increases in the second and third quarter, certainly we’ll do more units and we expect to do 3,000 when the year is complete.
Eric Bolton: But more specific I don’t think you’re going to see that program ramp up at a run rate much higher than what we planned this year. We continue to think its pretty important to manage this thing very, very aggressively and watch it carefully and of course we’re also pretty sensitive to how much dilution if you will we are willing to take as we take more units offline for longer periods of time and run up the vacancy loss so we’re pretty comfortable with the sort of the 3,000 a year run rate from an execution and our earnings management perspective and think that we’ll probably carry that same run rate into next year. But we’ll look at it more later in the year as we prepare for 2009.
Mike Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets: You mentioned in April that occupancies were up about 60 basis points, how is rent growth performing?
Drew Taylor: We’ve still got some scrubbing since that was really just yesterday and with the rent growth the way we measure it just sort of balancing concessions and ARU growth to get to effective, we don’t have that number just yet. It’s not a clean number, not one that we are comfortable sharing but continuing a positive year-over-year.
Eric Bolton: I would expect it to be pretty consistent but we’ll see as we get more color on the numbers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Did you have any comment about a change to your acquisition volume targets, I know it was $150 million but did you comment on that?
Eric Bolton: Nothing other than to say that we still feel pretty good about our assumptions. We closed on one deal earlier this year for our 100% on balance sheet.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: How much was that by the way?
Al Campbell: It was $23.5 million the first one in January. 
Eric Bolton: It was $23.5 million and then we’ve got another one under contract right now in Raleigh for $30 million and so we’ll see how it plays out. We still feel pretty good about the guidance.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Raleigh is $34 million?
Eric Bolton: Yes, about that.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Now in terms of the outperformance and the good results for the first quarter were you able to breakout how much of that $0.04 was interest expense, how much was operations, how much was G&A? Was it like sort 30-30-30?
Al Campbell: We’ll try to detail that a bit more but I think really in terms of performance compared to what we expected the operating performance was strong but it was about what we expected for the quarter. We had projected a good quarter so the majority of that $0.04 really more than half was really interest expense and then G&A primarily bonus expense kind of a little less than we had expected and prior year a portion of that in G&A.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Simon you mentioned the likelihood at least in terms of how you feel right now about keeping the preferred outstanding and using it as a potential redeployment source if other things don’t materialize, is that sort of the mindset right now that if you were to do this you would, if you were to think it through today that the preferred would sort of not get redeemed?
Simon Wadsworth: I think that’s a fair way of putting it. I think we feel as Eric has mentioned we feel reasonably good that we may be approaching an attractive environment for investing in some of these opportunities and so and of course the preferred is about an 8.3% yield which is about what its replacement cost would be and we will have the free call option so I think that we probably will leave most of it out if things play out as we think it will play out.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: Same question from the acquisition volume I asked earlier, what about on dispositions, I think the number was 60 are you still targeting that?
Eric Bolton: Yes we are.
Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets: The big swing factor for the second quarter $0.10, what’s causing that? Is it just the timing of the acquisition?
Simon Wadsworth: I think we try to keep a fairly wide range as you know we always do and some of that has come because of actually from sort of our conversations we had with our audit committee, but I think the big uncertain thing is interest rates and how, frankly how some of the Fannie May DMBS trades because that is, can be, those can fluctuate. I think the timing of this Raleigh acquisition would make a difference too because that is dilutive, because its only 40% leased. But those I would say would be the two biggest factors. Now the third one which I mentioned in the call which we will get further clarity on as the quarter develops of course is and as most of you know by now I’m paranoid about real estate taxes and we still have to get more information as time goes on about real estate taxes and that is a big wildcard. And as I mentioned for every 1% that [I’m wrong] that’s about $0.01 a share and of course you have to kind of catch up if you’ve been either over or under for the full year accrual. But those I suppose would be the three items that would cause us to kind of be wanted to change from the mid point of the guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sheila McGrath - Keefe, Keegan & Company
Sheila McGrath - Keefe, Keegan & Company: I was wondering if you could give us an update on the development projects, how the lease-up is going versus your expectations and pro forma rents, etc?
Tom Grimes: Things are honestly just rolling along on all of them. We are pleased with where the pricing is and we are pleased with the way the leasing is going. Brier Creek Phase 2 is 71% occupied, 76 leased and on target from a pricing area. And there’s been really no cannibalization of phase one which is 97 occupied right now. Then St. Augustine and Copper Ridge are yet to, we haven’t started leasing those two yet. So that’s a far as the pure wholly-owned development that we’re doing, those are the three biggies.
Sheila McGrath - Keefe, Keegan & Company: And how is the lease-up going on the Phoenix property?
Tom Grimes: The Phoenix property is coming along. We are excited. It broke the 90% barrier, 91 occupied now, 94 leased. So we’ve been a little behind the curve I think we mentioned on start-up, we started a little behind the curve when we bought it but given the headwinds in the Phoenix market we’re very pleased with how its leased up and stabilized.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy McCulloch - Green Street Advisors
Andy McCulloch - Green Street Advisors: You touched on this a little bit but can you just give us a little bit more color on Florida and where you think we are in the cycle there both in Jacksonville and your other markets?
Tom Grimes: I think where we’re most concerned about on the shadow supply type issues are in south Florida and in Tampa and Orlando. Mercifully we have light exposure in south Florida and our products have been somewhat protected there because of its suburban location and a very, very good school district along with very good operating team. In Tampa we’ve had sort of the benefit of deed-restricted neighborhoods on the northern two and then the other two that are in more of a wide open market we’ve just had a little bit better performance in terms of managing the gap between physical and effective occupancy in closing that and frankly we’ve had the benefit of 16 units come back online that were on down status from a fire. The other places, Jacksonville, we’ve hit on before with the turnover primarily focused at Lighthouse Court our southern most asset. What we’re seeing about that that is a little encouraging the whole, the reason the property has run behind us is because move-outs and home buying and the house renting, that was particularly evident in the fourth quarter. We are sort of pleased to see that moderating at that property specifically in the first quarter and while performance wasn’t great there, there were 160,000 behind last year we saw some recovery take place as those trends moderated, occupancy grew. So we’re hoping it’s on the rebound a little bit. And then we’re also seeing some weaknesses in places like Melbourne and Ocala but with one asset there in each of those, we’re coming along. So Florida to me feels a little better. We’re certainly learning to, we can compete much better today than we could a year ago. We’ve leaned our organization up and we are feeling better about the way we compete. It’s hard for me to call the bottom of Florida yet. I just don’t have that kind of insight and I apologize for not giving you a firmer answer on that.
Andy McCulloch - Green Street Advisors: What was the NOI for the quarter from Brier?
Tom Grimes: NOI for the quarter on Phase 2 on development was up 7% ahead of where we thought it would be, it was $232,000.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from the line of David Cohen - Morgan Stanley
David Cohen – Morgan Stanley: Can you talk about just the St. Augustine project, it looks like you pushed back the completion and stabilization date, is that just due to the market conditions or did I miss something?
Drew Taylor: Essentially we had some construction delays at St. Augustine where we had some soil condition issues to start the project that delayed it slightly and then frankly there’s been some rain down in Florida which has delayed construction there but its nothing to do certainly with our expectation of how we think the project is going do. It’s just off to a bit of a slower start than we expected.
David Cohen - Morgan Stanley: Does that impact your [IOR] expectations for the project?
Drew Taylor: It doesn’t. I think it increased our capitalized interest costs just a little bit but we have contingencies that are going to cover or sort of that the [IOR] is intact. We expect it to be 7.5% still. NOI stabilized yield at 7.5 rather.
David Cohen - Morgan Stanley:  When you do redevelopment what are the rules in terms of capitalizing the units that you’re redeveloping, it sounds like you keep them in service but what are the rules in terms of the capitalization?
Al Campbell: We use a criteria, if you see we have a few of, I think eight properties we pulled out of same-store and really we pull them out of same-store if they are significant rehab and I think…
Drew Taylor: If we’re going to renovate 50% more of our turns and we’re going to spend more than $6,500 a unit, we pull it out of same-store. 
Al Campbell: And if it’s a lighter rehab given those criteria we keep it in same-store.
David Cohen – Morgan Stanley: In terms of same-store, but does it still impact your income statement?
Simon Wadsworth: No it doesn’t. Let me put it like this, taking units out of service, yes it does impact our income statement because the units are going to be down during the redevelopment period and so we do not capitalize any costs associated with the down period. That gets expensed through the P&L statement. Now the only possible impact on the P&L statement is that as part of the redevelopment process inevitably some normal rehab, some normal turn costs may get capitalized. But generally that’s pretty small. And so but we don’t if you like; capitalize any costs associated with units that are taken out of service. That’s expensed through the P&L.
David Cohen - Morgan Stanley:  Greenville’s been particularly weak; can you touch a little bit more on that? 
Tom Grimes: That really is driven by our largest property there and Eric touched on this a little bit earlier where we have a significant rehab going on at that property and we just got a little bit of dilution caused by there. We’re happy with what Greenville is doing but we’re incurring a little more vacancy loss there than we normally would because of the renovation project.
Operator: Your final question is a follow-up from [Steve Radanovich] – BB&T Capital Markets 
[Steve Radanovich] – BB&T Capital Markets : Real quick on the developments, can you just remind me of what the yields are on those three developments and if they’re moved at all?
Drew Taylor: They have not moved. They are intact and what we expected them to be before we started. Brier Creek which we finished but is still leasing up is 77; the other two are mid 7 annualized stabilized yields both for St. Augustine and for Copper Ridge.
Simon Wadsworth: Having been in the development business one thing we’ve learned is to have a bit of a cushion in there to protect us against Murphy’s Law and so we’re still well within the cushion thank goodness.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time; please proceed with any further remarks.
Eric Bolton: We appreciate everyone being on the call. Call if you have any questions. Thanks.

Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for participating in the Mid-America Apartment Communities fourth quarter earnings release conference call. The company will first share its prepared comments followed by a question and answer session. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Director of External Reporting. Leslie you may begin.
Leslie Wolfgang: Good morning everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang Director of External Reporting for Mid-America Apartment Communities. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Simon Wadsworth, our CFO; Al Campbell, Treasurer; Tom Grimes, Director of Property Management; and Drew Taylor, Director of Asset Management. Before we begin I want to point out that as part of the discussion this morning company management will make forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday’s press release and our 34-X filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports along with a copy of today’s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning’s call can be found on our website. I’ll now turn the call over to Eric.
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: Thanks to everyone on the call for joining us this morning. Simon and I will provide a few comments on the quarter and our forecast for 2008 and then we’re going to open the line for your questions. As reported in yesterday’s earnings release Mid-American ended 2007 on a very positive note. Our fourth quarter same store result was one of the best performances we’ve had over the past 10 years. For the quarter Mid-America captured 12% growth in FFO per share and 19% growth in AFFO per share. Year-end same store occupancy increased 60 basis points over the same point of the prior year to 94.8%. This is the highest year-end result we’ve posted over the past 11 years. In addition to the strong occupancy leasing concessions were down a significant 38% over the comparable prior year quarter. The strong fourth quarter supports our belief that leasing fundamentals remain in an overall healthy position across our portfolio. As we head into 2008 we believe we’re in position to generate another year of solid results. Simon will walk you through the details of our 2008 guidance but our basis for expecting another good year is built on the following three key points. First as we commented in last quarter’s call Mid-America’s portfolio is not heavily exposed to the pressures from the excess of single-family and condo inventory that is impacting apartment leasing in a number of markets across the country. At our properties traffic levels are holding up well. We continue to see evidence that the return to more disciplined mortgage financing is reducing our resident turnover attributable to home buying. Continuing the pattern that emerged in the third quarter resident turnover due to home buying dropped again on a year-over-year basis declining by almost 8% in the fourth quarter as compared to prior year. Overall we expect to see continued positive absorption and stable leasing conditions in 2008. In fact last week’s same store occupancy for January month end was 95.3%. It’s worth noting that’s an increase of 90 basis points in occupancy from the same point last year and up 50 basis points from year end just a few weeks ago. Secondly, we believe that during 2008 we will capture year-over-year momentum from various new systems and technologies implemented over the past year. We continue to see upside from the implementation of LRO, the automation of processes associated with up-front application and move-in fees, additional fee opportunities in the area of utility billings and additional efficiencies recently introduced integrating our software with outside collection agencies. By the end of the second quarter we expect to complete installation of new web-based advertising and leasing programs which will provide a fully automated seamless leasing process for potential residents. In 2008 we also are introducing new web-based tools for interacting with our existing residents as well as enhancing several aspects of our inventory management and term processes. As most of you know we’ve made a major effort over the last few years to retool and automate many aspects of our operating platform. Our systems and property management folks have done a terrific job with these projects. We continue to build capabilities in asset management and property management that has a growing competitive advantage over many of the management companies that we compete with in our local markets and submarkets. And finally we expect earnings momentum in 2008 to remain solid as a result of the excellent results being realized from our unit and tier renovation program. Our team completed just over 2,000 unit renovations in 2007 and we expect to complete around 3,000 this year. Our properties are putting through very strong rent increases averaging 15% above and beyond the normal market rent increases we capture on non-renovated units. As we penetrate more of the portfolio with this program the overall impact to operating results will increase. The benefits from this initiative are of course both on the revenue side from rent increases as well as increasingly lower turn expenses as these units are upgraded and the number of new features are installed. On the transaction front we believe it is likely that opportunities are improving for making new acquisitions. Obviously some of the aggressive leverage buyers are out of the game for the moment. Well capitalized balance sheets with proven performance in closing transactions are in a stronger position and we’re optimistic about improving opportunities to capture investments that meet our hurdles. For our own account we are currently looking at a number of investment opportunities that will enable us to continue upgrading the age and quality of the portfolio at an average age of now 15 years Mid-America’s portfolio remains one of the youngest among the apartment REITs and clearly one of the higher quality portfolios for the markets and submarkets where we operate. As noted in yesterday’s earnings release we recently closed on our first acquisition for Mid-America Acquisition Fund One a joint venture we established last year. The property located in a strong job growth inter-tier suburban location in Atlanta represents the sort of turnaround and value-add opportunities targeted for this Fund. Through repositioning both the curb appeal of the community and unit interiors along with the ongoing on-site operating platform we expect to capture a very attractive investment return for the Fund and for Mid-America shareholders. We have another acquisition opportunity for the Fund currently under contract and undergoing due diligence.  We have quite a bit underway and are indeed optimistic about the opportunities and outlook for 2008. While we expect to see some slight moderation in operating results in 2008 as compared to the very strong performance captured over the past two years we nevertheless expect to deliver another year of steady progress and good results. We’re comfortable that our regional focus and unique diversification strategy across the Sunbelt coupled with a disciplined capital deployment program and a very strong operating platform will continue to generate performance and returns to capital that will be very competitive in the apartment reach sector. That’s all I’ve got. Tom, I’m going to turn it to you.
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: Fourth quarter FFO per share of $0.93 was $0.02 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance driven by strong operating results and lower interest expense. Included in our results was a $0.02 non-cash charge associated with the refinancing of Series F Preferred and income of $0.01 from the sale of a land parcel both of which were included in our guidance. For the fourth quarter year-over-year same store NOI growth was at the top end of our guidance at 7.9% and one of our first quarterly results. Same store NOI growth prior to the accounting adjustment of straight line concessions was 8.9% also close to a record. Same store revenues for the quarter were up 4%. Without the straight line revenue adjustment the increase would have been 4.6%. Effective rent increased 3% on the concession reduction that Eric mentioned and on a 1.5% increase in average rent per unit. Before the impact of straight line rental concessions effective rent was up 3.5%. Same store expenses dropped 1.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding taxes and insurance property level operating expenses grew by 2.4% but our insurance expense dropped 25% effective with the renewal last July and we had a good quarter for real estate taxes which increased only 1.8%. A year ago we issued guidance for 2007 of FFO per share of $3.40 to $3.50 and same store NOI growth of 5 to 6%. We ended the year at the upper end of the range on each of these metrics. Our NOI growth rate was only slightly below that of 2006 and FFO grew while we continue to expand our investment in projects that have a long term value but carry short term FFO dilution such as our modest development program growing investment in properties and lease-ups such as Talus Ranch in Phoenix and the sale of four higher cap rate older properties. Together we estimate that our three lease-up properties plus our four dispositions cost us over $0.13 of FFO dilution last year. For the full year of 2007 AFFO increased 12% to $2.91, $0.04 above the midpoint of our beginning year guidance. Recurring capital expenditures dropped to $0.64 a share a reduction of $0.10 from the unusually high number in the prior year. Excluding the redevelopment program total property capital expenditures at existing properties was $700 a unit in 2007 or $1.00 a share and we expect this to continue at approximately the same levels in the future. Results for the quarter included double digit same store NOI growth by our high growth markets with strong revenue performance in Dallas, Houston and Nashville and strong overall performance in Greenville and Tampa. Other markets with double digit NOI increases include Memphis, Austin, Jackson, Mississippi, Chattanooga, Augusta and Lexington. Revenues were down on a comparative basis by 1.8% in Jacksonville mainly because of competition from single-family homes at just one large property. In Columbus, Georgia revenues on two properties grew 1% because of troop deployments. Strengthening markets and the implementation of yield management software have enabled us to reduce concessions in the fourth quarter on a cash basis from $460 per move-in a year ago to $201 this year a 56% reduction and down from 3% of net potential rent to 1.3% which is likely now approaching a stabilized level. Turnover increased 1.6% for the quarter compared to the same period a year ago mainly because of an increase in job transfers including military. As Eric mentioned the number of people leaving us to buy a house continued to decline dropping to 25.9% of move-outs from 28.5% in the fourth quarter of 2006. The number of people leaving us to rent a house dropped by 30 basis points to just 2.8% of move-outs. Net collection loss also declined from 0.74% of net potential rent to 0.69%.  Turning to the balance sheet our leverage defined as debt plus preferred total gross fixed assets dropped by 80 basis points from the end of last year to 59.2%. As a percentage of total market capitalization our debt plus preferred stands at a sector median 51.4% and our fixed charge coverage continued to improve from 2.15 in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 2.37 ahead of the sector median. We have just extended the maturities of our Fannie Mae credit facility to between 2,014 and 2,018 and we have a lot of balance sheet capacity. We’re fortunate that the apartment sector is unique in having Fannie and Freddie to provide debt financing and our conversations with them indicate that they have plenty of lending capacity. The two agencies have been our primary lenders for many years and we have strong long-term relationships. We have over $300 million of unused pre-committed credit under our agency and bank facilities of which $160 million is available under in-place mortgages and an additional $150 million is committed at our existing credit spreads. Also we have benefited as Treasury and swap rates have dropped and as agency debt securities are trading very favorably compared to LIBOR. We’re well positioned to reduce our average cost of borrowing in 2008 as we have $180 million of debt maturities we anticipate the financing of $150 million of acquisitions and 15% of our debt is floating rate. This will help us take advantage of what may become an improved opportunity to make some attractive investments. We’re glad that in this environment our business strategy is safer than most apartment REITs. We don’t have a lot of capitalized overhead and interest expense or a major development pipeline to fund. Our FFO is not dependent on businesses that carry a lot of transaction risk and we’ve seen over the years that our three-tier market strategy provides additional stability in operating performance during tough market times. Our 2008 forecast detailed in the release takes into account slowing economic growth and a continuation of what we think is a long-term shift of households back to the rental market. There’s a lot of uncertainty but we think revenues will continue to be fairly strong in most of our markets especially in Texas and the Carolinas. We expect solid growth in some other markets including Atlanta, Memphis and Nashville and in many of our growth and income in stable markets. Florida will likely continue to grow at a more moderate rate coming off some years of extremely strong performance. We have a couple of advantages that are helping us offset slower market growth rates. Our revenues will be helped on a relative basis for at least the first six to nine months of 2008 by the implementation of NRO in the second quarter of last year. Secondly, we believe that the straight line adjustment that cost us $0.05 a share in revenues in both 2007 and 2006 should no longer be a drag in 2008. The combined impact of these should be 150 basis points of same store revenue growth. So we think that our forecast of same store NOI growth in the 4 to 5% range compared to 5.8% in 2007 seems to be reasonable with revenue growth of 3.5 to 4.5%. I commented about the $155 million of Series H Preferred in the past which is callable in August of 2008. Its coupon is 8.3%. We’ve issued to full caps one with and one without the $0.18 per share non-cash cost associated with calling this Preferred. We expect to increase a number of properties we’ll sell that are either old or are in some low growth markets. Assuming we sell approximately $60 million this could be potentially dilute FFO by $0.04 to $0.05 per share on a 12 month basis. We’ll continue our investment program in development and lease-up properties and our two development projects.  While our investment will be on the high return opportunities in our redevelopment program and our Fund One joint venture we’ve included $150 million of wholly-owned acquisitions in our guidance. In January we closed on the wholly-owned acquisition of Cascade at Fall Creek a new property beginning lease-up in Houston and our Milstead Village in Atlanta our first acquisition for Fund One. The acquisition environment continues to be very competitive but Cascade was a special situation adjacent to one of our existing properties in an exceptional submarket. We think we have an advantage over many in our sector in making some attractive investments in this environment as well our cost of equity has risen. Our cost of debt has almost equivalently dropped. We remain disciplined and frequently evaluate on an MPV basis the relative attraction of various strategies including repurchasing shares. Excluding development property capital expenditures are forecast to approximate $28 to $29 million plus $2 million in newly acquired properties plus redevelopment. We anticipate that we’ll fund about $17 million for our share of the equity in Fund One our joint venture. We plan to finance our funding needs with almost $60 million in proceeds from property sales with debt under existing financing arrangements and if the equity markets recover with equity from the continuous equity plans. We anticipate that our borrowing and leverage will rise slightly but our fixed charge coverage should end this year at only about 10 basis points below current levels.
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: Our plans for 2008 are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will deliver steady and high quality earnings, cash flow and long-term value. We’ve always been disciplined about capital deployment and underwriting practices. We believe this discipline has enabled us to avoid some of the pressures in earnings volatility and balance sheet strength now evident with other strategies. With the solid earnings platform and balance sheet now in place we do plan to pick up efforts a little with capital recycling and will monetize internal rates return out of some our secondary and tertiary markets that I believe will surprise some people. We are committed to a steady program of continuing to upgrade our portfolio properties and retain one of the younger portfolios in the REIT sector and in the markets where we operate. We believe that we’re in a good position to continue delivering earnings performance and returns to capital that compete very well within the apartment REIT space and we believe it’s being done without a lot of the volatility and risk inherent in other regions, markets and strategies. Matt, that’s all we have in the way of prepared comments and we’ll turn it back to you for any questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Kristin O’Connor with Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
Kristin O’Connor – Morgan Stanley:  Simon, hat level of job growth are you expecting in your 2008 forecasts and how does that compare to 2007?
Albert M. Campbell: We’re basing our forecast primarily on REITs and www.Economy.com and other providers like that and generally what they’re calling for, for 2008 that we can see is GDP growth around 2 to 2.5% and with job production I think a total of about 1 million jobs adding in 2008. In our markets we think that most of our markets have favorable job growth and we expect that and we put that in our revenue performance and in general a modest growth period is what it’s based on.
Kristin O’Connor – Morgan Stanley:  Can you comment on the price and the cap rate that you paid on the Cascade at Fall Creek asset during the quarter?
Albert M. Campbell: I can. We paid about a 5.6 cap rate which is a little 6 to 6.4 NOI yield on that. We paid about $3.5 million for that deal at Cascade.
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: And of course that property was just beginning lease-up.
Albert M. Campbell: It was.
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: So that’s a stabilized cap. So we will have some dilution from that for the six or nine months.
Albert M. Campbell: We will and we expect to have 2.5 to $0.03 over the full year dilution from that. But once it’s stabilized those are the cap rates that you should see.
Kristin O’Connor – Morgan Stanley:  And then can you just comment on the overall trends you’re seeing in cap rates in your markets? Any change since last quarter?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: I would tell you that it’s still a little fuzzy out there right now. Clearly there’s a lot of capital still lining up for good transactions and good deals that we’re looking at, both new deals as well as some of the repositioned value add-plays. It appears to be still pretty competitive obviously the high leverage buyers are out of the equation now but for modest leverage buyers, and of course with Fannie and Freddie there, there’s still plenty of capital. But based on the deals that we’re looking at and all the things that we’ve studied it does appear that probably kind of a 50 basis point shift has taken place over the last four to five months, sort of holding all the other assumptions stable. That’s where we see pricing at this point.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Your question please.
William A. Crow – Raymond James Financial, Inc.: Following up on that question, the $150 million of acquisitions is a little higher of a goal than we would have assumed. Do you think that’s going to be more backend loaded? Does it pay at this point to wait and see where cap rates ultimately go?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: I suspect that it probably will be more backend loaded. I think that right now frankly it’s still tough to make the numbers work. We look at a lot of things but as I was just saying there is still a lot of capital chasing these deals and some of the sellers are still getting some pretty good pricing. The only way we’re able to really make things work still right now is somewhat similar to Cascade where we’ve got a special situation where we own the property right next door or we have a unique relationship with the developer or the seller in some way where we can get it on an off-marketed basis. I do suspect that it probably will be more backend loaded. We continue to believe that the markets are recalibrating a little bit and we’ll just have to see how this spread between public and private pricing continues to work its way out and hopefully we’ll see some more opportunities here that make sense for us.
William A. Crow – Raymond James Financial, Inc.: Are you seeing any relief on – I know you’re not really doing development – but construction costs in your kitchen and bath program or just your normal turns? Is there any relief there given the slowdown in the single-family market? Yeah, I would say not a lot. Drew, do you want to add anything about the kind of costs we’re seeing?
James Andrew Taylor: From a development point of view or a redevelopment point of view our costs now are essentially what they’ve been in the past. So we’re not really seeing any net change and what it’s costing us to redevelop or to develop at this point.
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: I think on the development front where you may see some change over the next year is just in land cost. But I think material costs I don’t think we’re looking at any declines. At least from what we see. We don’t do a lot of it as you know. But we’re not seeing a lot.
William A. Crow – Raymond James Financial, Inc.: And then finally on the concessions, that’s clearly been a benefit to you as you brought those things down. How much is left to recapture and then are you actually starting to see concessions go up across any of your markets?
Albert M. Campbell: Bill, what we have in the forecast is a continued decline of concessions. I think this year they are about 1.9% of net potential rent. We project them to go down about 1.4% which is a couple million bucks in reduction. Then I think concessions will continue to be a part of our platform although on a much reduced scale. We are seeing some continued improvement [inaudible].
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Anderson from BMO. Your question please.
Richard C. Anderson – BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Just a clarification on your same store disclosure. The total same store, that takes out the straight line impact or that includes the straight line impact?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: Including the straight line impact. If you go to our supplemental data you can also see it without that.
Richard C. Anderson – BMO Capital Markets Corp.: So the revenue for fourth quarter was up 4.6 operating, 4% total. The total has the straight line in it?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: That’s correct.
Richard C. Anderson – BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay, so if it has the straight line in it, wouldn’t that suggest if the number is lower that your concessions are higher on a year-over-year basis?
Albert M. Campbell: What that suggests is just that the burn off of concessions during the year, Rich, they caused us to write off more of our balance sheet of prepaid concessions that we have. It’s really more related to the counting of our straight line. We had win because of that in this year.
Richard C. Anderson – BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Tom, you mentioned the $0.04 to $0.05 of dilution. I didn’t catch what that was tied to. Potential annual dilution.
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: The $0.04 to $0.05 of annual dilution from the three lease-up properties.
Albert M. Campbell: We have several things in general in our 2008 forecast in a cost solution. I think we took development properties that we have and that’s probably together about $0.04 or $0.05 and that’s Cascade, Farmington Village – I’m sorry.
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: And the four dispositions that we made.
Albert M. Campbell: Together all of our lease-up and our four dispositions are expected to be about 8 to 8.5%, Rich, for 2008.
Richard C. Anderson – BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay, so the lease-up properties are $0.04 to $0.05 and then the dispositions are another, say $0.04. $0.03 or $0.04.
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: Roughly.
Albert M. Campbell: For 2008. That’s correct.
Richard C. Anderson – BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Question on acquisitions, $150 million target. The question is if you miss your acquisition target, fall short of it, will that be a positive or negative FFO for the year?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: It really has no impact.
Richard C. Anderson – BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Can you talk about how your return hurdles have changed in this environment from an acquisition standpoint, if at all, and how those return hurdles might be different for transactions done in the Fund?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: Our return hurdles haven’t changed in terms of the methodology and the way we define our hurdle process, if you will. What changes is our cost of equity and our process has always been based on looking at our cost of equity plus a 20% premium to that. It essentially becomes our internal rate of return hurdle and that’s whether we are putting capital into a new acquisition, into a new joint venture or into redeveloping our existing properties. The methodology is the same. So there’s been no change, it’s just as our cost of equity continues to fluctuate with the market it will change.
Richard C. Anderson – BMO Capital Markets Corp.: But no change to the absolute number because your cost of equity might have gone up but your debt costs have gone down. Is that a fair way of looking at it?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: Let me elaborate just a little more, Rich. That is, we look at our returns on a leveraged basis. So our cost of equity has gone up and so our hurdle rate has gone up very significantly. But the effect on pricing has been mitigated because our cost of debt has come down. And so that’s the way it’s been working.
Richard C. Anderson – BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Last question is hopefully not too grim. Any impact on the tornado activity on your portfolio?
James Andrew Taylor : No, frankly. Other than we had a lot of folks under desks and things like that. It was really pretty quiet across and we got through Little Rock and then we realized Memphis was fine and then we worried about other places and other than a few sticks down and a little bit of siding blowing off, we were fine.
Operator: Our next question is from Nap Overton of Morgan Keegan. Your question please.
Napoleon H. Overton – Morgan Keegan & Co.: Just a couple of things. One, did I understand you correctly to say that your straight line rent adjustment negatively impacted both 2007 and 2006 by $0.05 per share?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: That’s correct.
Napoleon H. Overton – Morgan Keegan & Co.: And you expect that to be around to zero for 2008?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: That’s correct. Maybe slightly positive. It should be close to zero.
Albert M. Campbell: The drag is removed from our 2008 forecast, yes. The 6.5% - I think I know the answer to this – but the 6.5% NOI yield on acquisitions that you’re assuming, that’s before deducting a capital reserve? Is that correct?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: That is correct, Nap. It probably equates to a 5.75% cap, something like that.
Operator: Our nest question is from Bi Kin Kim of Credit Suisse. Your question please.
Bi Kin Kim – Credit Suisse: Just a quick follow up on a previous question. What profits do you use to calculate your cost of equity?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: We use several methods but the one we use routinely, take our dividend yield plus long-term growth rate and generally we assume a long-term growth rate is in the 5 to 6% range. Take our dividend yield and then we multiply by 1.2 to come up with our hurdle rate as Eric was mentioning. That’s the way we do it.
Bi Kin Kim – Credit Suisse: Second question. You mentioned share buy backs. Any plans for that in [inaudible] in terms of volume?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: We have not dialed that into our forecast. It is something we look at but we are a net present value shop, if you will. Our decisions regarding capital deployment are driven by what do we think is going to create the highest net present value for our shareholders. There is a point obviously where out stock price could decline low enough that the debt becomes the best alternative and we look at it and discuss it with our board on a routine basis.
Bi Kin Kim – Credit Suisse: What’s your current authorization?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: We have 4 million shares authorized and we’ve used I think, we bought back about $1.8 million. So we’ve got about $2.2 million still outstanding.
Operator: Our next question from Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird. Your question please.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Just to follow up. I think you said this earlier, but I missed it. Are you more focused in your acquisition opportunities on buying redevelopment opportunities, lease-up opportunities or more the fully position properties like you did at Cascade at Fall Creek?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr.: For the moment our focus primarily is with our acquisition fund where we’re looking for redevelopment opportunities. The numbers frankly just work better on those kinds of deals at the moment. So we’re very active in the market looking for both kinds of opportunities but the numbers are working better at the moment on the repositioned through our JV platform.
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr.: As a reminder when you have a one-third interest in the JV platform, and of course we get fees and so forth, so the IRRs just work for us better.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Is there any friction when you come across an opportunity between putting it on your own balance sheet versus putting it in the Fund?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr. :  No. That’s a good question and one of the things we were very clear about up front in establishing this fund and the relationship is the way it works, any property that we find that is seven years of age or older, we show it to our Fund and to our JV partner. If it’s less than seven years of age then we do not show it to the Fund. We’re primarily looking to add on to our own balance sheet newer properties but, over the years we’ve done a lot of value creation through repositioning properties but, we didn’t want to put a lot of the older product on our balance sheet. We wanted to limit our investment of those to our one third ownership to the JV. So, it’s a seven year cut off.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co.: That’s very helpful. Thanks. On the redevelopment program, how many units do you do at one time and roughly how long does that take?
H. Eric Bolton, Jr. :  The way it works is that we really look at it on a community-by-community basis and if we think that a particular property has the potential for being repositioned through unit interiors then we will go in and start testing a few units at the property and see if we are in fact able to catch the higher rent bobs as a result of the repositioning effort. Then, we generally approach it as units turn. We don’t force turnover generally and so on a given property it may take a couple of years or so to get through all the units. But, our approach is to look at all the communities that we have, all the different properties in the portfolio and evaluate it and start testing it and then move forward. And, we’re very, very disciplined about it. We look at every specific unit, we make the renovation and then we rent it. If we’re able to get the rent that we felt like we had to get or to justify the investment then we continue. If it’s not working then we stop.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Great. Thanks. A question on the move out, aside from home ownership, are you seeing any trends in some of the other reasons for move out?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr. :  The other two trends that were up other than buying homes were we saw an increase in rent increases as a reason for move out which frankly we sort of like to see. It means that we’re aggressively pushing rents. It wasn’t any large level. The other thing is on job transfers as people are moving around. It is important to realize we do separate job transfers and job loss, job loss is one that we actually saw go down about 8%.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co.: That’s very interesting.
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr. :  Well, it’s very encouraging.
Paula Poskon – Robert W. Baird & Co.: One last question, on the Briar Creek project in Raliegh, it looks as though there has been no leasing progress made since last quarter. Can you just provide some color on what’s happening there? How’s traffic, etcetera?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr. :  Paula, you get the $100 beer certificate for catching our typo. What that is, is occupancy has stayed essentially flat there which we would expect at this time of year for two reasons. One, the property is reaching that 65 to 75% mark where we typically see turnover begin to occur. So, we saw some turnover occur there and then we also entered the weaker side of the leasing season so sort of winter slowed us down slightly. We’ve leased 158 units there total. We are currently 63.5 occupied and 70% leased. More important than that, on a year-to-date basis we’re about 21% ahead of pro forma on our revenues. Our occupancy is slightly behind pro forma but our rents, our effective rents are about 4.4% higher. We’re seeing a little bit of lull because of seasonality and turnover and then January we had a better leasing month in January than any of the prior months in the quarter.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Carole Kemple of Hilliard Lyons. Your question please.
Carole L. Kemple – Hilliard Lyons: I was wondering what was the cap rate you all paid for the Milstead Village?
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr. :  That was a redevelopment one.
H. Eric Bolton, Jr. :  The NOI unit on that Carol was around 5.25 and 5.5 and I think its important here that is a redevelopment property that has a significant component that income you won’t justate for the first couple of years.
James Andrew Taylor : We can get you that specific number but my guess is once its stabilized after the repositioning you’re looking at an NOI yield of probably closer to 7, 6.75, 6.50 to 7. 
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr. : I would 7% NOI once it stabilized.
James Andrew Taylor : Once it’s stabilized. Once we get the repositioning done.
Operator:  Our next question is from Andy McCulloch from Green Street.
Andy McCulloch – Green Street Advisors: Most of my questions have been answered, I just have one small question. How much NOI did Briar Creek through off in 4Q.
Thomas L. Grimes, Jr. : In fourth quarter it was $299 thousand dollars. We expected it to do about $218 so it was about $80,000 ahead of pro forma.
Operator:  At this time I’m showing no further questions from the audience.
H. Eric Bolton, Jr. :  Thank you very much. If you’ve got any follow up questions feel free to give us a call. Thank you.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.
