===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Rupe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Rupe: Thank you, Chuck. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We've included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Meaney: Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. We are pleased with our strong start to 2025. Our team's focus on providing solutions that meet our customers' needs as part of our Matterhorn growth strategy continues to drive record results across the business and above our expectations. On a reported basis in the first quarter, we achieved all-time high quarterly revenue of $1.6 billion, representing 8% year-over-year growth and record first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $580 million, an increase of 12% as compared to last year. This performance was even better when excluding the effects of foreign exchange with revenue increasing 9% and adjusted EBITDA growing 13% to last year. Strong growth was achieved in each of our key business units. Our portfolio of growth businesses, which represents more than 25% of our total revenue and includes data center, digital solutions, and asset lifecycle management collectively grew more than 20% in the quarter. And our traditional records business achieved record results as well. This formula supports our ability to sustainably drive double-digit revenue and profit growth. Our commercial team continues to make marked progress in executing our strategy. I'm especially pleased with the breadth and scope of customer deals we are winning. For example, during the first quarter, our global scale and reputation were key factors in securing multiple records management and ALM deals where customers consolidated to single vendors, further testimony of the benefits from our number one ranking in customer satisfaction by the Wall Street Journal of the top US-listed companies. And we achieved broad cross-selling success through both traditional add-on solution sales and by partnering across the business to integrate multiple solutions for the customer. This approach met the customer need to get their job done seamlessly and truly differentiates our individual offerings by the whole suite being worth more than any single product. Our potential for growth remains significant, especially with the substantial expansion of our solutions offerings in recent years. To complement our cross-selling efforts and capitalize on this opportunity, we have marketing initiatives underway to increase awareness of our complete solutions offering. Let me now turn to an update of our key achievements and customer wins that showcase the success we are delivering against our strategic priorities, which are driving continued revenue growth in our physical storage records management business, delivering differentiated digital solutions, which truly -- which give truly transformative results to our customers in terms of revenue, security, and cost, supplying differentiated data center offerings through our global scale and customer trust, and providing asset lifecycle management capabilities, which are secure, economic, and environmentally sustainable. Let's begin with our records and information management business. We are pleased with our consistent and strong performance. Storage volume continues to increase modestly each quarter and our revenue management is further accelerating growth by capturing the enhanced customer value we are providing through our global and integrated services. Additionally, we are driving record digital revenue and a growing percentage of this revenue is recurring. Let me highlight a few new projects we secured during the quarter, starting first with records management. A Greek bank, an existing customer for over 10 years, chose Iron Mountain to store records from 20 locations following a merger. The strength of our relationship, the security of our facility, and the speed and efficiency of our document retrieval services led to cost savings for the customer. Additionally, a global insurance company's operations in Thailand awarded Iron Mountain a three-year records management agreement with the first project utilizing our Smart Sort solution to manage over 3 million commingled files. I'm also excited to share recent accomplishments in our digital solutions business. Our InSight Digital Experience Platform, or DXP, continues to gain traction and acceptance in the market. Customers are realizing the value of this SaaS platform, which is reflected in larger deal values and shorter sales cycles. We are continuing to expand DXP's capabilities to manage and create structure from unstructured content, increase efficiency through process automation, enable visibility of dark data, increase compliance, and make information actionable. We are also tailoring DXP use cases to industry-specific requirements. I'll highlight a few of our recent wins in digital solutions. In the United Kingdom, we have secured a 10-year contract with an existing customer, expanding our relationship significantly. Under the agreement, we will intake an additional 350,000 cubic feet of documents, digitize close to 9 million images per year, and provide DXP access to 2,500 users. Our store, digitize, and access solutions will enable the customer to realize financial savings, operational efficiencies, and an overall improved stakeholder experience. In Europe, we strengthened our relationship with a long-standing healthcare client through a three-year deal to digitize patient documents. Moreover, the customer is using our InSight DXP Platform's AI capabilities to provide concise summaries of patient incidents and to facilitate efficient access to critical information. We will digitize 500,000 documents and 750,000 images a month whilst also providing physical records management. Our solution will provide enhanced scalability and accelerated processing time, resulting in substantial cost reductions for the customer. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we believe our many years of experience in providing digital transformation services to the United States government positions us well to assist the broad DOGE effort. And now let me briefly highlight a significant order we received yesterday. We have been awarded a contract for the Department of Treasury. We will be assisting with a broad digital transformation effort leveraging our DXP platform and its embedded AI capabilities. The contract value is approximately $140 million and will commence immediately with the majority of the revenue in 2026. I would like to thank the Treasury and the Department of Government Efficiency for their trust in Iron Mountain. Lastly, during the process of this award, more people involved in transforming the federal government have learned about our capabilities and experience in digital transformation. The result has been that we have seen a marked increase in our digital services pipeline serving a broad range of federal agencies across a number of improvement and efficiency initiatives. Let me now turn to our data center business. For the quarter, we continued to execute on our strong leasing backlog with revenue growth of over 20% year-over-year, driven by more than 24% organic storage growth. In the first quarter, our enterprise leasing activity was in line with expectations, leasing approximately 4 megawatts of new business. Whilst we did not sign new hyperscale contracts in the quarter, we are responding to strong interest across our US, European and Indian sites. We expect this to convert over the course of the year, which aligns with our projection for 125 megawatts of total new leasing. We continue to see strong demand for data center development across our global portfolio and our pipeline remains strong. When fully developed, our current portfolio will reach 1.3 gigawatts, more than triple the size of our current operating portfolio. Finally, I would also like to welcome Gary Aitkenhead, our new EVP and General Manager of Data Centers. Gary joins us from Equinix and reports to Mark Kidd, who leads our data center and ALM businesses. His global experience, proven leadership in driving transformation and growth, and commitment to fostering high-performing inclusive teams will be a key asset to our customers and team as we further expand the business. Turning to our asset lifecycle management business, we continue to drive strong growth in this large and highly fragmented ALM market. In the first quarter, we achieved 44% reported revenue growth, including 22% organic growth with strength across both the enterprise and hyperscale channels. In the enterprise channel, our commercial team's success is evidenced by the size and scope of deals we are winning. We think over time, as large enterprises become more sensitive to the cyber risks with the disposal of their IT assets, Iron Mountain's brand will play an ever-increasing factor in their vendor selection. And in the hyperscale channel, given the robust growth in data center development in recent years, we anticipate strong tailwinds for decommissioning work for the foreseeable future. We will leverage our differentiation as a data center operator in this channel to capture additional share. We will also continue to selectively acquire ALM enterprise businesses to expand our capabilities and geographic footprint. In late March, we acquired Premier Surplus in the Southern US, expanding our customer base and capabilities. To illustrate our growing strength in this segment, let me now share some of the ALM wins achieved during the quarter, which continued to drive strong double-digit organic growth. A large global fintech company specializing in online payments and employing over 20,000 people globally has selected Iron Mountain as its exclusive ALM partner for the secured disposition of its assets following the customers' consolidation of providers. Our long-standing relationship with this customer, our flexibility, and our experience handling sensitive assets contributed to this win. We also secured a new customer win with a global technology infrastructure provider with over 35,000 employees. Iron Mountain was chosen to manage a large batch of materials the customer accumulated through a series of acquisitions. Our solution met all of this customer's requirements, including chain of custody, reconciliation, secured wiping, and remarketing. Our reputation and brand were also key to this win. In conclusion, I'm proud of the strong results that our dedicated Mountaineers continue to deliver. Our team's commitment to meeting the needs of our nearly 250,000 customers worldwide is integral to our success. As Barry will share in more detail, we are increasing our full year guidance to reflect the strong Q1 performance and positive outlook. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. Our team is off to a strong start this year, delivering record first quarter results across all of our key financial metrics. We achieved record revenue of $1.59 billion, up 8% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis. We delivered strong organic growth in the quarter of 8%. Total storage revenue was $948 million, up $64 million year-on-year and up 9% on an organic basis. Total service revenue was $644 million, up $52 million from last year. Organic service growth of 7.1% was ahead of our expectations and improved slightly from the fourth quarter rate despite lapping a much more difficult comparison from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA of $580 million was a record for the first quarter and expanded $61 million year-on-year. This was $5 million ahead of the projection we provided on our last call. The upside to our projection was driven by $4 million of operating performance and approximately $1 million from the US dollar's weakening in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.4%, up 130 basis points year-on-year, which reflects improved margins across all of our businesses. A key highlight for me in the quarter was that our team delivered significant operating leverage with an incremental flow-through margin of greater than 50%, which is the highest we've achieved in years. AFFO was $348 million, up $25 million, which represents growth as compared to last year of 8% on a reported basis and 10% excluding FX. AFFO on a per share basis was $1.17, up 6% to last year on a reported basis and up 9% excluding FX. Now, turning to segment performance. I'll start with our Global RIM business, which achieved first quarter revenue of $1.26 billion, an increase of $46 million year-on-year, driven by revenue management and digital solutions, partially offset by the stronger US dollar, which negatively impacted revenue by approximately $20 million. Organic storage was up 6%, driven by revenue management and consistent volume. Organic service revenue was up 5% with contributions from digital and core services. Reported service revenue was down $4 million on a sequential basis due to a $3 million decline in terminations and permanent withdrawal revenue and another $3 million headwind from the stronger US dollar. Our digital business had another strong quarter, achieving record revenue. We are also pleased to report improvement in our records management retention rate and storage capacity utilization, both of which achieved the highest levels we've seen in some time. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $556 million, an increase of $30 million year-on-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin of 44.3% was up 80 basis points from last year, driven by operating leverage and revenue management. Let me provide a brief update on our consumer storage business following our commentary on our last call. While consumer storage remained a headwind to revenue growth in the first quarter, the team is driving solid operating improvement. Profitability is increasing and we are seeing very positive trends in storage reservations, which is a key forward indicator for revenue. Turning to our global data center business. Total data center revenue was $173 million in the first quarter, an increase of $29 million year-on-year. Organic storage rental growth increased 24% driven by lease commencements and continued strong pricing trends. In the first quarter, new commencements were 12 megawatts, including 8 megawatts in Northern Virginia. Pricing remains strong with the average price per kilowatt on new commencements up 15% as compared to last year. We renewed leases totaling 10 megawatts with strong renewal spreads of 19% and 27% on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively. First quarter data center adjusted EBITDA was $91 million, up 48%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 960 basis points from the first quarter of last year and up 60 basis points sequentially to 52.4%. Improved pricing, recent commencements, and operating leverage were the key drivers of the strong margin expansion in the quarter. Turning to asset lifecycle management. Total ALM revenue was $121 million, an increase of $37 million or 44% year-over-year. On an organic basis, our ALM team delivered 22% growth. The strong performance was driven by volume increases in both our enterprise and hyperscale businesses. On an inorganic basis, Wisetek and APCD continued to perform well and contributed revenue of $18 million. We are pleased with the continued improvement in ALM profitability, which was up significantly as compared to last year, benefiting from acquisition synergies as well as improved operating performance across the business. As we discussed last quarter, our strong customer wins, both in enterprise and hyperscale give us high visibility to accelerating growth as we move through 2025. I will note that our organic growth increased over 1,000 basis points on a sequential basis, ahead of our expectations, despite pricing being broadly flat to slightly down. Regarding our acquisition of Premier Surplus, I should note, this was completed right at the end of the first quarter. So, its results were not included in our quarterly financials. For modeling purposes, we expect Premier will contribute revenue of approximately $10 million to our full year results. Turning to capital allocation, we remain committed to our strategy that is balanced between funding our growth initiatives, delivering meaningful shareholder returns, and maintaining our strong balance sheet. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $657 million with $629 million of growth and $28 million of recurring. Our outlook for capital expenditures is unchanged from our prior call with approximately $1.8 billion of growth and approximately $150 million of recurring, both consistent with the levels from last year. We are planning for capital spending to be more first-half weighted. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.0 times, in line with our expectations for both the quarter and year-end. Turning to our dividend, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.785 per share to be paid in early July. On a trailing four quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 62%, in line with our long-term target range. And now, turning to our outlook. Based on our strong first quarter performance and positive outlook and recent changes in currency exchange rates, we are pleased to increase our financial guidance. For the full year 2025, we now expect total revenue to be within the range of $6.74 billion to $6.89 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 11% at the midpoint. Relative to our prior guidance, we are raising revenue by $90 million based on the weaker US dollar, continued strong revenue management, improved outlook for ALM performance and the Premier Surplus acquisition. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be within the range of $2.505 billion to $2.555 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 13% at the midpoint. Relative to our prior guidance, we are raising adjusted EBITDA by $30 million. And we now expect AFFO to be within the range of $1.48 billion to $1.51 billion in AFFO per share to be $4.95 to $5.05. At the midpoint, this represents 11% and 10% growth respectively. For the second quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.68 billion, an increase of 10% to last year. Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $620 million, up 14% year-on-year. AFFO of approximately $350 million, which is up 9%. And AFFO per share of approximately $1.18, up 9% to last year. Before closing, I would like to address two additional items. First, regarding the contract with the Department of the Treasury that Bill mentioned, as it was awarded just last night, we have not included it in our financial guidance. For modeling purposes, we expect the contract will generate revenue in both 2025 and 2026 with the majority of the benefit next year. We look forward to updating you on the progress of this deal and our [Technical Difficulty] on our next few calls. Second, knowing that tariffs are a key area of investor interest, I wanted to provide some perspective on our exposure. In our Global RIM business, our exposure to tariffs is essentially zero as our revenues and costs are matched based on each market in which we operate. In our ALM business, the vast majority of the revenue is generated from IT gear that we decommission and then resell in the same market. For example, we decommissioned gear in the US and then resell it to US-based customers. And as a result, there is no cross-border impact. While we do have some components which are sold into China, let me share a couple of important points. First, over the last few years, the team has done a terrific job significantly diversifying our downstream sales away from China. And for those components that are sold into China, I would highlight that tariffs tend to be based on the original manufacturing country of origin and as such, we would not anticipate an impact on our component sales. Lastly, in our data center business, the vast majority of the cost of construction is not subject to tariffs. We estimate that we have less than 5% exposure within data center construction. With that said, let me conclude. Our year is off to a great start with record-breaking first quarter results across all key financial metrics. Our outlook is strong and we are pleased to increase our full year guidance. We are focused on driving double-digit revenue growth over many years, supported by our strong cross-selling opportunity into what are very large fragmented markets. I want to express my gratitude to all of our mountaineers for their continued dedication to serving our customers. And with that, Operator, would you please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much. Bill or Barry, if you can just talk a little bit about the market for leasing. The leasing activity has been uncharacteristically low for the last three quarters. Last quarter, you talked about a large deal that you walked away from due to some market conditions you didn't want to accept. If you could just talk about what's going on, your confidence in being able to achieve that 125 million of megawatts, because it does assume pretty good step-up and down the rest of the year? And then if you don't mind my just tagging on, Barry, at the end of your last comment, you talked about the data center expansion, less than 5% exposure. If you don't mind just elaborating on that a little bit more because it's very timely and your ability to potentially change terms of customers in terms of there's tariff impacted cost changes with imports? Thank you.
Bill Meaney: Good morning, Shlomo. So, why don't I start on the leasing and then, Barry can talk -- give you a little bit more detail in terms of how we estimated the 5% impact on construction costs. So, on the leasing, first of all, we had a good quarter. If you look at the leasing activity that we had for our normal enterprise colocation sales, we were very pleased with the amount of activity in leasing and continued pipeline in terms of the enterprise colo side. On the hyperscale side is, we feel very good about our 125 megawatt guide for the year, and that's based on our pipeline and also the conversations that we're having with some of our largest hyperscale customers across a number of locations, both in the US, Europe, and India.
Barry Hytinen: And, Shlomo, it's Barry. Yeah. So, when we look at the cost of construction on data center, of course, there's a fair amount of labor in the development of the sites. Then there is -- and that's in the form of general contractors, there's obviously design and other construction-related costs. There is some level of import both in things like steel, but also some of the component MEP that comes in. But when we look at it, we think the total exposure is sub-5%. Of course, I'll note, we do run a global data center portfolio. So, when you factor in what's affected in the US, that's a factor of that as well. And then I'll just say, as it relates to pricing, Shlomo, I think pricing in the data center market continues to be very strong. You saw our mark-to-market renewal spreads. And my expectation is to the extent that there were tariffs ongoing, the market would absorb those and returns would continue to be quite strong. So, we feel very well-positioned and don't see much in the way of tariff exposure to the data center business for the foreseeable future in light of the fact that a lot of the supply is on long-term supply commitments and we order those for delivery over a long period of time. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I want to stick on the topic of data centers. You mentioned you're very pleased with leasing activity. You feel good about hyperscalers. But I want to take a step back. And so if you look at broader data center demand at the industry level, certainly has been evolving. Has there been any place within your business where you've seen any changes in demand in data centers from any part of your customer set?
Bill Meaney: Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. Actually no. I mean in the conversations that Mark and now Gary have been having, I tag along on some of those conversations, we haven't seen anything that's changed in terms of the appetite for the largest customer, the hyperscale side and that's really across the three geographies I mentioned, across North America, Europe, and India. And I think the other side about that is also what you see there even their announcements. They've been pretty rock solid. In fact, some of them have even increased their guidance around CapEx -- expected CapEx expenditure over the next 12 to 24 months. And you can kind of consider about half of their CapEx expenditure tends to be -- depending on the hyperscale, but tends to be outsourced, some are more, some are less. So we haven't seen any real change in that macro environment. And the scarcity of power and locations continues to give us a very strong pipeline.
Operator: Your next question will come from Tobey Sommer with Truist. Please go ahead.
Tobey Sommer: Thanks. With respect to your sales strategy and initiatives across the businesses, I was wondering if you could talk to us about what your most important initiatives are and how you think you're tracking against them for this year and in the next.
Bill Meaney: Yeah. No, thanks, Tobey, for the question. At the core -- you're putting your finger on what really is the core behind the Matterhorn strategy. So, if you -- and I know you're catching up to the story, but the big shift that we made as part of Matterhorn is we created a Chief Commercial Officer, who is Greg McIntosh, and we have a central point, which is -- that drives our relationships with the customers. So, as I said, critical to what Matterhorn is all about is not just the products of portfolio that we -- or the increased portfolio of products that we've launched, which have taken us from $10 billion to now over $160 billion in terms of total addressable market, but it's how we get after that in terms of offering our customers a single point of contact for Iron Mountain and the cross-selling across those businesses. And that's really what's taken us from a single-digit growth company to a consistently double-digit growth company because people recognize that one-stop-shop, a broad range of products and services. And of course, it helps that 25% or a little bit more than 25% of those products and services just have macro tailwinds that typically grow more than 20%. But you're spot on that the big part of the transformation story around Matterhorn was that single customer point of contact into Iron Mountain where we can sell the whole range, Mountain range, if you will, of products.
Operator: The next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Hey. Hey, Barry, can you maybe disaggregate the $90 million of increase on the revenue and the EBITDA? How much of that was currency versus revenue management? It sounds like Premier was about $10 million. But how much of the additional $80 million or so was FX as opposed to other things?
Barry Hytinen: Hey, Kevin. Good morning. Thanks. The increase was $90 million. And of that $90 million, $75 million of that just -- maybe just under that is the change in the FX rates. And then we've got $10 million from Premier and then the remainder, so between $5 million and $10 million -- depending upon how you cut the FX, between $5 million and $10 million is just pure operating performance. And honestly, it's still early in the year, Kevin. So, I would tell you that we feel extraordinarily good about way the business is trending. And as we mentioned on the call, I didn't include the recent -- yesterday contract win that we had with the US government. So, I feel good about where we are in terms of that guide and continue to update the market on how we're trending through the year. So, thanks for that question.
Operator: The next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. One on data centers and then one on ALM. So, for data centers, just interested in kind of where you see the opportunity set by region. Where might be the deal volumes or the deal sizes be the most meaningful relative to your portfolio?
Bill Meaney: Okay. No, thanks for the question. I think the -- if we -- let's start with the US. In the US, we continue to have a lot of pipeline, as you would expect, in Northern Virginia and now also in Richmond, kind of the new Northern Virginia for that region. We also see strong pipeline and interest in our Chicago locations, relatively new to the portfolio. Miami, we just broke ground on that facility just recently. That's a smaller facility. So, it's more kind of edge deployment, but also strong pipeline. So, those three markets, we continue to see strong pipeline also in Arizona, but we're almost completely full in Arizona. So, I'd say right now, it's Northern Virginia, including our Manassas campus, as well as Richmond, which we've added capacity to Manassas, and Richmond is relatively new and then Chicago and then more edge deployment around Miami. In Europe, the expansion of our Amsterdam campus, again, strong pipeline. As you know, Amsterdam is a key market for a lot of the hyperscalers and there's limited capacity in Europe broadly, in Amsterdam in particular. So, we feel really good about the pipeline that we have associated with Amsterdam and now Madrid, right? So those are probably the biggest markets for us. We're sold out in Frankfurt and London at this point. So, then if we go to India, which is relatively newer to our portfolio, and you might have noticed that we actually bought out the remaining stake in Web Werks. That's now 100% owned. But we have really strong pipeline across their sites. But specifically, I would say, as you would expect, Mumbai, we're expanding nicely in Mumbai -- in the Mumbai market and as well as Chennai. On the ALM, maybe, Barry, you might want to comment.
Barry Hytinen: Jon, did you have an ALM question there? I know you said you did.
Jonathan Atkin: Impressed, if you were going to answer it before I asked it.
Barry Hytinen: Well, I'm not doing my Kreskin impersonation this morning, Jon. So, we'll take the question.
Jonathan Atkin: I was interested just the mix and how you see it evolving across cloud, hyperscale and enterprise, international versus US and then the lens with which you kind of evaluate potential for the M&A in that segment.
Bill Meaney: Maybe I'll start with the mix and then, Barry, you can comment a little bit to the question on the M&A. On the mix is -- I think we might have mentioned this on the last call, because of the ITRenew acquisition, is our mix has been historically more skewed towards the hyperscale or decommissioning of data center assets. That is starting to shift because the acquisitions, whether it's Wisetek, Premier or Regency for that matter, have been more on the enterprise -- and the market itself is more enterprise. So, if you think about the market is more like maybe 70%-30%, 70% enterprise end-user devices, other IT assets within enterprise customers, and 30% data center decommissioning, ours was almost the opposite. It was more like 60% data center decommissioning and 40% enterprise. That's starting to shift as we are doing the acquisitions and we feel good about that shift. It's not that we love the hyperscale business, but you can imagine with also the cross-selling -- our cross-selling ability into almost 250,000 customers on the enterprise side building out that footprint is really nice. In terms of geography is, although we're really pleased that we have better coverage now in the southern part of the United States because of our recent acquisition, but I think we feel we're pretty well covered in the United States from a geography standpoint where we need to get to in terms of serving the customers. Wisetek, which obviously was an Irish-based company, has really helped us fill out a lot of the European side, although they also have a small presence in Thailand. So, that helped us in Asia. And I think in India, that's a market that we are continuing to look at in terms of acquisitions. We have small presence in India, but I think it's fair to say in India and the Middle East, we have more work to do. We go further into Asia Pacific in terms of major markets. We also -- I think it was the last call, we announced an acquisition in Australia and I actually visited that acquisition maybe about a month ago and that's off to a really, really nice start and that's a -- it's a key market. So, I think the short answer to your question is, you're going to see our business to reflect more like the macros of the industry that will start shifting to be more of a natural mix of, let's say, 60%, 70% enterprise, 30%, 40% data center decommissioning. And then geographically, I think we're in really -- we're really well covered, I would say, in North America. I would say in Europe, we're pretty well covered. I mean, there's still some things that we're looking at to fill in some countries on that. We could always do more in Eastern Europe. And then India, we're looking at some acquisitions as well as the Middle East and Australia, we're well covered. Now, there are other markets that we continue to look at like Latin America, as you expect in some locations in Eastern Europe.
Barry Hytinen: Jon, it's Barry. Just a couple more thoughts there to add on. From an enterprise versus hyperscale perspective, in the first quarter, we were just about 59% enterprise, 41% hyperscale. Pro forma for the Premier deal would be in the low 60%s as Bill was suggesting and trending higher. We like both parts of the business, obviously, enterprise and hyperscale. On the hyperscale side, there's a high visibility of a massive amount of volume that continues to grow in light of data center decommissioning needs in light of the fleets of data centers out there that have been growing and continue to grow at, as you know, very fast rates. And so, that brings with it a considerable amount of volume. As we've also talked about before, though, the margins on that business, it's more of a revenue-share model. So, margins are lower, but high degree of volume. On the enterprise side, where it's much more of a flow business and a continuous business that somewhat annuity like, the margins are better. It's more of a service offering. And we -- and obviously, as Bill was mentioning, the market there is much larger than the hyperscale side. So, we do expect the business to continue to trend more enterprise. That brings with it a better margin mix, as I was mentioning. Also, it creates more opportunity for operating leverage and scale efficiencies across our network and to be able -- as we service our clients better. And you're seeing some of that play out as the business continues to get more scale. As I mentioned on the prepared remarks, the ALM profitability has continued to improve. I think the team is doing a great job there and that's thanks to acquisition synergies as well as improved operating leverage. And just one last point on acquisitions in the ALM space. We continue to be on the lookout and actively working on incremental tuck-ins here and there. We generally continue to see multiples in that mid to high single-digit of EBITDA. And on an acquisition synergy adjusted, that kind of very quickly gets down below five times. So, we think it's a very positive way to both grow and augment the organic growth that the team is delivering. I'd just echo one of the points we made, the team delivered 22% organic growth in the quarter in ALM, a very strong performance as -- and ticking up meaningfully from the fourth quarter. And as we said earlier, we've got a strong trajectory for that organic growth to continue to accelerate, Jon. So, thanks for that question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead. Mr. Lynch your line is open.
Bill Meaney: Brendan, if you're on mute, we just -- we can't hear you.
Brendan Lynch: Sorry, how about now?
Bill Meaney: Yeah, we got you, Brendan.
Brendan Lynch: Okay. Sorry about that. Yeah, sticking with the ALM theme, the volume was up quite a bit in the quarter. Can you talk about what triggered that? Did downstream pricing or something else change in the market that allowed you or your customers to accelerate the pace of selling inventory?
Bill Meaney: Yeah. So, Brendan, I think it's much more aligned with the fact that we've been consistently winning more business and the team is both growing our enterprise book of business through the wins that we've made throughout last year, which kind of build on themselves. As I was describing earlier, it is kind of tends to be a flow-oriented business where you win an account and then you start taking on more and more volume from the account because of course, all of the accounts that we're winning have an existing means for recycle reuse. So, the enterprise volume continues to come through. And then on the data center decommissioning, as we mentioned last year, we continue to win additional accounts and win more share within the accounts that we were already servicing. Pricing, just I'll reiterate something I made -- comment I made in the prepared remarks, pricing in the market was actually kind of largely flat to slightly down, I would say. So, it wasn't like pricing created a opportunity. And incidentally, in my go-forward projections, we got a little more conservative with pricing. We left our pricing assumptions at levels where they exited the first quarter, which I think could prove conservative, but we just felt like that was the right way to do it in light of what we were seeing in the quarter. So, feel very well positioned.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-13 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Iron Mountain Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Rupe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Mark Rupe: Thank you, Betsy. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We're joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2 and our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William Meaney: Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results. 2024 marked another year of record performance and double-digit growth for Iron Mountain. We achieved all-time highs for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO for the year and for the fourth quarter. Our record results were also broad-based across all of our businesses. For the full year, revenue increased 12% to $6.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% to $2.2 billion and AFFO increased 11% to $1.3 billion. And in the fourth quarter, revenue increased 11%, adjusted EBITDA grew 15% and AFFO increased 12%. These outstanding results reflect the strength of our highly profitable business model, broad and growing portfolio of solutions, long tenure customer relationships and the hard work and dedication of mountaineers across the world. The results also validate that Project Matterhorn has proven to be very beneficial to our business and we are exceeding the growth targets we established at our Investor Day presentation in 2022. I should also point out that a foundational element behind Project Matterhorn was to accelerate growth through embracing a customer-centric culture. Whilst we are still on a journey in this regard, it was pleasing to be ranked number one for customer satisfaction by the latest Wall Street Journal ranking of the top US listed companies. For this, I want to thank my fellow mountaineers. Since 2021, we have grown both revenue and adjusted EBITDA at an 11% CAGR on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, this growth is 13% annually, delivering a result on both a reported and constant currency basis well above the 10% targets we established. We are also performing above our targets for AFFO, which has grown at a 9% CAGR on a reported basis or 11% on a constant currency basis versus the 8% target. Our success and the momentum we have built over the past three years gives us increased confidence as we look ahead and is reflected in our guidance for 2025. Our portfolio of growth businesses, including digital solutions, data center and asset lifecycle management, are collectively growing at a CAGR greater than 20% and becoming an increasingly larger portion of our revenue. If you recall at the beginning of our Matterhorn climb, our growth portfolio represented 15% of our total revenue. As we enter 2025, the growth portfolio represents 25%, which continues to build the momentum behind our consolidated growth goals. Together with our records management business increasing at mid to high-single-digit rate, we naturally expect to deliver consolidated growth in excess of 10% for the foreseeable future. Our growth is driven by three principal factors. The recurring nature of our revenue streams, both from our traditional as well as our newer business areas, the strong macro factors supporting double-digit demand for our portfolio of growth businesses, and the success we continue to demonstrate in cross selling to our loyal customer base comprising nearly 250,000 customers, which includes 95% of the Fortune 1000. We are already the market leader in multiple businesses and are focused on building our scale, increasing our operating leverage, broadening our solutions offerings and leveraging our commercial platform to capitalize on Iron Mountain's unique position as a truly end-to-end solutions provider transcending both the physical and digital worlds. Based on our excellent results exceeding our expectations in 2024 and the strong confidence we have in our outlook for 2025, our Board of Directors has authorized an increase of our quarterly dividend by 10%. Let me now turn to an update of our key achievements in customer wins to showcase the success we are delivering against our strategic priorities, which are, driving continued revenue growth in our physical storage records management business, delivering differentiated digital solutions, which give truly transformative results to our customers in terms of revenue, cost and cybersecurity, supplying differentiated data center offerings through our global scale and customer trust and providing asset lifecycle management capabilities, which are both economic and environmentally sustainable. Let's begin with our Records and Information Management business, which grew 7% in 2024. Our recent customer wins are a testament to the power of our solutions portfolio and success in cross selling. In the US, we have secured a four year contract with a Fortune 500 company, which included renewing and expanding the number of locations we serve for records management as well as adding additional services from across our portfolio, underlying our continued focus on cross selling. Our records management, asset lifecycle management, and digital solutions will provide comprehensive solutions to enable this customer to streamline internal processes to enhance efficiency. Our team's customer-centric approach successfully demonstrated the value of forging a partnership with one provider to support their broader needs. I am also excited to share recent accomplishments in our Digital Solutions business. Our Digital Solutions business achieved record revenue in 2024, with recurring storage, service and software growing to more than 30% of digital revenue. We continue to see momentum and adoption of our SaaS based platform, InSight Digital Experience Platform or DXP with emerging use cases that are enabling our customers to improve their ability to access, manage, govern and monetize their physical and digital information to drive insights and intelligent decisions. On last quarter's call, we highlighted 24 DXP deals booked. In Q4, we signed 39 deals. Our customers are leveraging AI machine learning based capabilities within the DXP platform to automatically extract metadata and deliver business outcomes through process automation. Some of the use cases include consumer lending, compliance, HR and benefits management, and providing a platform which future proofs the ability to search unstructured data. I'll highlight a couple of our recent wins in Digital Solutions. In the US, we secured a multiyear deal with a long standing global financial services customer for our InSight DXP Solution. Our client was looking for a solution to enhance its operational efficiency by automating metadata extraction, streamline exception processing within an integrated environment, and support long-term scalability. By integrating DXP into its workflow, the customer is able to seamlessly manage process exceptions, reducing manual intervention and improving accuracy across its treasury operations. This is another example of a successful cross sell. Our Intelligent Business Process Management solutions also continue to gain traction across regions due to our unique ability to provide unified end-to-end solutions across physical and digital assets with proven capabilities to operate at scale across various environments and industries. In Australia, a government department that has been a customer for more than 25 years has turned to Iron Mountain to improve processes related to records management and data retrieval while ensuring retention compliance. Our end-to-end solution includes document imaging and secure destruction under a five year plan that will manage risk, drive efficiencies and enable our customer to deliver best-in-class service and answering inquiries. Our proven track record and ability to deliver a comprehensive suite of services at scale enabled us to secure this important work. Turning to our Data Center business, industry demand for Data Center development remains incredibly strong. In 2024, we grew our Data Center revenue by 25% to a record $620 million. Also given the strong demand for our Data Centers, we added to our land portfolio and now have a total capacity of nearly 1.3 gigawatts when fully built out. This is an increase of 420 megawatts year-over-year or a growth of almost 50%. As it relates to leasing, we had a very good year of activity in 2024, our third consecutive year where we leased more than 100 megawatts, including 10 megawatts in the fourth quarter. Whilst we exceeded our original leasing projection of 100 megawatts with 116 megawatts, this was slightly below our updated view at midyear. Given the continued strength and build of our pipeline as we enter 2025 and beyond, we maintained our underwriting returns expectations and decided to pass on a significant opportunity in the fourth quarter. For 2025, we expect another year of strong leasing activity with 125 megawatts projected. Our strong leasing activity shows that we are an attractive partner to customers looking for infrastructure that can support their very dense IT workloads associated with their AI enabled services. I would also like to highlight the announcement today of our joint venture with Ooredoo, the publicly listed telecom and data center company, which serves Qatar as well as the region broadly. This JV furthers our existing footprint in the Middle East by adding data center services to our portfolio. The Middle East is one of the fastest growing data center markets globally. We will take a minority stake in the venture. The JV will serve their existing data center portfolio in Qatar, Kuwait, Tunisia as well as the expansion across multiple markets in the Middle East Region. Ooredoo was looking for a partner with global operating expertise in hyperscale data centers to assist with capitalizing on the significant market opportunity. This partnership is a testament to our operational strength and credibility within the data center market as well as our relationships with the top global hyperscalers. Let me now turn to our Asset Lifecycle Management business, which continues to represent a significant growth opportunity as we expand our capabilities and geographic footprint in this highly fragmented market. In 2024, ALM revenue increased 119% with nearly 30% organic growth. Regency Technologies had a very strong year and our recent acquisitions of Wisetek and APCD are also performing well. We recently secured a long-term agreement with a large global healthcare company to manage the lifecycle of their IT assets. We will provide IT services and workstation deployment for end user devices as well as data center infrastructure decommissioning and remarketing services. The combination of our global footprint in logistics infrastructure, operational scalability, and remarketing expertise enabled our team to deliver meaningful synergies to the customer. We have also secured our first significant Asset Lifecycle Management contract in Canada. This is with a large North American insurance company for whom we provide a range of records management and digital services. We are now providing its Canadian subsidiary with ALM services, including laptop sanitization and end user redeployment, helping to address inefficiencies in workstation management across 60 locations and supporting process automation and other cost optimizations. Our track record of delivery for this customer over many years helped secure this deal, as did our ability to offer a comprehensive, flexible and streamlined solution that includes automation and security best practices. Staying with the ALM business, we are partnering with the US State Government to deliver a fully managed hard drive destruction program across its agencies. This deal builds on the existing records management and digital services we provide to this customer, demonstrating we have the compliance and security credentials and the operational expertise and scale to deliver a comprehensive range of information management solutions for our customers. This is a good illustration of the kind of work we do for governments in general, including the US federal government. Given the recent interest in our federal business as well as the growth opportunity that we believe DOGE will offer us, let me provide a bit more background. We work for more than 200 agencies of the US federal government, both as a direct provider and subcontractor of services. The physical storage of documents accounts for approximately $10 million in revenue. Correspondingly, this represents about 0.5% of our total physical volume. We also generate $130 million in data center and digitization transformation services. We have been growing in both of these areas with the government over the last few years as we assist certain agencies with process automation and digitization. As the government continues to drive to be more efficient, we see this as a continued opportunity for the company. To conclude, I'm very proud of the strong results our dedicated mountaineers continue to deliver. At the core of our success is how our team meets the needs and serves our nearly 250,000 customers around the world each and every day. As we look to 2025 and beyond, we continue to have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us and still just scratching the surface of the $150 billion of the total addressable market for our services. We have a very strong and growing foundation and the momentum across each of our growth businesses is clear and tangible. As Barry will share in more detail, our guidance outlook represents another record year of double-digit revenue growth for Iron Mountain in 2025. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. As you've heard this morning, our team continues to execute very well against our strategy. We delivered record fourth quarter and full year results across all of our key financial metrics, and we are entering 2025 with strong momentum. Turning to our financial results. During the fourth quarter, we achieved record revenue of $1.58 billion up 11% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis. This was driven by 8% storage growth and 17% service growth on a reported basis. We delivered strong organic growth in the quarter of 8%. Total storage revenue in the quarter was $942 million up $71 million year-on-year. We drove 9% organic storage growth, half of which was driven by revenue management trends in our Global RIM business and half from our Data Center business. Total service revenue was $639 million up $91 million from last year. Organic service revenue increased 7% year-on-year, driven by our ALM and Global RIM businesses. Reported service revenue growth reflects the inclusion of our recent ALM acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA was $605 million a new record and up 15% year-on-year. This was above the $595 million projection we provided on our last call and would have been nearly $610 million on the same FX rates that we used in that projection. The performance upside was driven by improved price margin realization and cost productivity across our company. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.3%, up 130 basis points year-on-year, which reflects improved margins across all of our businesses. AFFO was $368 million, up $40 million which represents growth as compared to last year of 12% on a reported basis and 14% excluding FX. AFFO on a per share basis was $1.24 up $0.13 from last year and also ahead of the projection we provided on our last call of $1.21. Now let me briefly summarize the full year, which marked our fourth consecutive year of record performance across all key financial metrics. Revenue of $6.15 billion increased 12% on a reported basis and 13% on a constant currency basis. Our full year revenue achieved the high end of our guidance range despite the negative FX we incurred throughout the year. Our commercial team's focus to sell across our entire range of products and services continues to be an important driver of our growth, and we are still in the very early days of capitalizing on this large cross selling opportunity. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% year-on-year to $2.24 billion, an increase of $275 million. With this performance, we exceeded the high end of our full year guidance. AFFO increased over 11% to $1.3 billion or $4.54 on a per share basis. And now turning to segment performance. I'll start with our Global RIM business, which achieved fourth quarter revenue of $1.26 billion, an increase of $66 million year-on-year. Revenue management continued to be a key driver in the quarter across storage and service, leading to adjusted EBITDA margin reaching a new all-time high. Organic storage was up in excess of 5%, driven by revenue management and consistent volume. Sequentially, it was down slightly due to the stronger dollar and our focus to drive operating performance in our Consumer Storage business. And I should note, our Records Management business was up sequentially and year-over-year in line with our normal trends. Organic Service revenue was up 8% with contributions from digital and core services. Our Digital business had another strong quarter, achieving record revenue. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $579 million an increase of $45 million year-on-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin was up 130 basis points from last year, driven by operating leverage and revenue management. Turning to our Global Data Center business, the team delivered revenue of $170 million an increase of $33 million. This was a 24% increase from the fourth quarter of last year, driven by strong organic storage rental growth of 27%. For the full year, Data Center revenue grew 25% to $620 million continuing the multiyear trend of accelerating growth. Our visibility to revenue growth and our pipeline both continue to be very strong, supporting our outlook for further acceleration in 2025. I'll also note that 94% of our under construction assets are already leased, and as such, we have very high visibility to this revenue projection. Fourth quarter Data Center adjusted EBITDA was $88 million up 51%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 930 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year and up 820 basis points sequentially. Improved pricing, recent commencements and operating leverage were the key drivers of the strong margin expansion in the quarter. We saw a continued positive trend in pricing for new and expansion leases with the full year average price per kilowatt increasing more than 40% as compared to full year 2023. Based on our visibility into commencements, we expect strong adjusted EBITDA margin improvement in 2025 with the full year increasing 400 basis points year-over-year as compared to the 45.6% achieved in 2024. Turning to Asset Lifecycle Management. Total ALM revenue in the quarter was $112 million, an increase of $60 million or 118% year-over-year. On an organic basis, our ALM team delivered double-digit growth, which was driven by expansion in our Enterprise business. Regency Technologies performed very well this quarter with revenue of $34 million and strong profit contribution. Our recent acquisitions of Wisetek and APCD performed ahead of our expectations in the quarter. We are especially pleased with the continued improvement in ALM profitability, which is benefiting from Regency synergies as well as improved efficiencies in both the Enterprise and Data Center decommissioning channels. Turning to Capital Allocation. We remain committed to our strategy that is balanced between funding our growth initiatives while delivering meaningful returns to our shareholders and maintaining our strong balance sheet. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $721 million with $685 million of growth and $36 million of recurring. For 2025, we are planning for capital expenditures to be similar to last year with approximately $1.8 billion of growth and approximately $150 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet, with strong EBITDA performance, we ended the year with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.0 times, which remains at the lowest level we have achieved since prior to the company's REIT conversion in 2014. For 2025, we expect to end the year at similar levels to year-end 2024. Turning to our dividend, our target payout ratio is low to mid-60s%. And on a trailing basis, we ended the year at 60%. In light of our favorable outlook for AFFO, our Board increased the dividend by 10% effective with the April payout. This marks the third consecutive year where we have increased the dividend. Now let me share our projections for full year 2025. We anticipate another record year of performance across all of our key financial metrics. For 2025, we expect total revenue to be within the range of $6.65 billion to $6.8 billion which represents year-on-year growth of 9% at the midpoint. On constant FX rates, this implies growth of 11% at the midpoint. This includes 10% organic growth for 2025, which is ahead of the 9% and 7% organic growth we delivered in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and reflects the growth across our portfolio. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within the range of $2.475 billion to $2.525 billion which represents year-on-year growth of 12% at the midpoint. On constant FX rates, this implies growth of 13% at the midpoint. We expect AFFO to be within the range of $1.45 billion to $1.48 billion which represents year-on-year growth of 9% at the midpoint. On constant FX rates, this implies growth of 11% at the midpoint. And we expect AFFO per share to be $4.85 to $4.95. This represents year-on-year growth of 8% at the midpoint and on constant FX rates, this implies growth of 10% at the midpoint. Turning to the first quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.59 billion. Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $575 million. AFFO of approximately $342 million and AFFO per share of approximately $1.15. A couple of last points for modeling. We expect AFFO growth to accelerate through the year as the phasing of cash taxes will be more first half weighted than last year. And we expect the FX impacts on reported results will be less of a headwind as we move through 2025 based on the timing of the US dollar strengthening last year. To conclude, we are pleased to have delivered another record year in 2024, and we are entering 2025 with strong momentum. I would like to express my thanks to our entire team for their continued dedication to serving our clients. And with that operator, would you please open the line for Q&A?
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Can you elaborate on how organic growth in the ALM business in 4Q was split between volumes and component prices and what broader trends you're seeing with both?
Barry Hytinen: Yes, George. Hi, George. This is Barry. Good morning. Thanks for that question. Generally speaking, it was largely volume. It was almost all volume driven, George, because and it, of course, varies based on the channel. But, as you've seen, we're becoming more and more enterprise driven in the company, which is consistent with the size of the market. And that's where the margin improvement is substantial in terms of from both what we're doing for clients at being more of a service oriented business as well as, much more consistent in terms of the -- to book a business that continues to build. What we saw in component prices on the data center decommissioning side was generally flattish. Some of the components were down a little bit. Some were up a little bit. But on average, it was basically flattish, and so that was also volume driven. The organic business performed well, and we actually feel very good as we move into 2025 as it relates to both businesses, the data center decommissioning and the enterprise, because we won some new clients on the data center side and, additional project revenue. As you know, that is a project oriented kind of business, can be a little bit more, quarter-to-quarter, project oriented. And then on the Enterprise business, that continues to ramp. And as Bill mentioned, we won some very big deals there relative to our portfolio. So we expect enterprise to continue to perform throughout the year on a growing basis. And I will just say that we are not planning for component pricing to be, of much change at all to where it ended 2024. And that that may be proved conservative, but we'd rather just plan that way and let you know that we see a lot of volume coming in 2025, thanks to our pipeline. Thank you, George.
Operator: The next question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP. Please go ahead.
Nathan Crossett: Hey, good morning. What's your expectation for RIM volumes in Q1 and maybe the balance of 2025? And what should we be kind of expecting for RIM pricing growth this year? Thank you.
William Meaney: Thanks, Nate, for the question. I think you can expect 2025 to be consistent with the last couple of years, flat to slightly up volumetrically. And most of the growth will be revenue management and pricing. So you're kind of mid-single-digit, mid to upper-single-digit overall revenue growth coming out of our room business. So very consistent with what you've seen in '23 and '24.
Barry Hytinen: Yes. And Nate, it's Barry. I'll just add that we expect volume to be flat to slightly up throughout the year, and that includes the first quarter to your question. Also from a standpoint of timing on revenue management actions, we would expect that to be more consistent in terms of the timing of actions this year, whereas you recall last year, we had a little bit of phasing and so that helps bolster the point Bill was making about mid to upper-single. And with that, I will say, we continue to feel that we differentiate very strongly based on the value we bring to clients in terms of the ancillary services they can generate by storing with us, which they really can't get from anybody else, such as our Smart Sort, our digitization on demand and our very fast growing digital business. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to touch on the Data Center business. Maybe you could just, Bill, at a high level, talk about any longer-term implications from the DeepSeek announcement a few weeks ago, it kind of did create a lot of noise in the market and people questioning the pacing of AI training CapEx and what impact that could have on the Data Centers. And I think you also made a comment about how you passed on a large opportunity that didn't meet your underwriting returns. Just curious to get any more color there and what you're seeing in terms of market pricing going forward and forward returns. Thank you.
William Meaney: Okay. Thanks, Eric. Well, let me start with the last part of your question and then talk about DeepSeek. I think on the -- in terms of where we see our pipeline and leasing activity is that we do have a very strong pipeline. And based on that pipeline, where we set our guidance for this year, also our multiyear guidance. So if you think about overall, we set guidance last year at 100 megawatts, this year 125 megawatts, so 25% year-on-year growth. All that's consistent with the financial plan or the multiyear plan that we laid out in 2022. And you can see that in terms of driving the revenue growth that we're getting as those leases actually commence in the reported revenue and EBITDA line. So we feel really good about that. Specifically, when we are on the last -- the Q3 call and we were looking at the pipeline we were -- we did have a very large opportunity in our pipeline that gave us visibility to 130 plus megawatts for the year and we passed on it at the end because we felt that at the end of the year, sometimes customers have an expectation of the discount they're going to get to give you a lease before the year-end. And we just didn't like the pricing on that and especially when we look out at our pipeline and we see all the hyperscale opportunities that we already have in the pipeline. These are 10-year contracts. So we're not going to make short-term decisions just to hit a leasing number, especially when we see the number of contracts that are still in play in our pipeline over the next 12, 18, 24 months. So and I think you know the business well is that you should think about our business as normally something that, let's say, around 10 megawatts comes in plus or minus on any quarter in addition to the large hyperscale deals, which are much more lumpy, but if over a 12 month period, we feel we have a lot of visibility, hence, our continued driving our growth in terms of our leasing guidance. So coming to your DeepSeek question, this -- we think of the DeepSeek thing as two halves. One is we see that it's -- we expect it to drive some further acceleration in our digitalization business because as there's more competition in thinking about what large language models can do and how to construct those large language models, obviously, it's going to give people different price points for our AI-driven tools that we use on our digitization business to actually pull those things down. More broadly, in terms of our data center business, we look at the reporting that came out of a number of our large customers over the last couple of weeks, and not a single one of them is reducing their CapEx expenditure by even a cent. So when we look at that is that we don't see DeepSeek and there was a lot of buzz when it was announced, but we don't see any substitute change in terms of our customer base, in terms of how they're expecting to continue to grow their data center infrastructure
Barry Hytinen: Eric, the only thing I would add is that when you look at the thesis we've been signing on our price per kilowatt as well as what we've commenced, what you'll see if you compare that versus prior years is, as I mentioned on the call, it's growing very nicely, right? The average price is meaningfully higher and so that's -- you see coming through in the EBITDA margin as we start to commence a better book of business, if you will. And so as Bill mentioned, we're going to continue to stay price disciplined and return oriented and if you look at the backlog of what we have commencing going forward, that gives us strong confidence in the revenue and margin guide that we shared on the call. Thanks, Eric.
Operator: The next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a follow-up on DeepSeek. It did raise some questions about the flow of US hardware and chips into China. If the US were to implement tighter restrictions on exporting IT hardware to China, how do you think that would affect the ALM business?
William Meaney: Thanks, Brendan, for the question. So first of all, think about it, most of our ALM business that gets sold into China is multi-generations previous. So none of these have been touched upon in terms of export restriction. We are continuing to, as we've talked about before, driving a diversification strategy to be less reliant on China where we actually resell components and I should say that a big part of our resales, which I think we talked about in the last call, has been more and more on hard drives recently than even the CPUs and GPUs, which are more sensitive in terms of technology. So I think we continue to drive the diversification. So far, anyway, all our components of multi-generation old and don't come trapped on that. The other thing I should say is Barry talked about is that we see very much see our strategy as continuing to build on a mixed basis the enterprise side of the business. And that's, it means that you'll be less project-based, less reliant in terms of selling into China. But the other part of that Enterprise business is some of the work that we're doing with some of the OEMs on reintroducing the components back into their own supply chain. So we really see that's where a lot of the business will be going because as we all know is electronic components generally fail at the beginning of their life, not kind of in the middle of their life. And a lot of our OEM customers are now starting to asking us to actually do that harvesting and help them reintroduce it back into their supply chain.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Just following up on the Data Center. Barry, the churn in Q4 was 4.4%. I don't think that was related to the client you passed on, but just any thoughts on what drove that and probably onetime, but just maybe help us understand that a little bit.
Barry Hytinen: Yes. Sure, Kevin. That's something that we've had on the horizon for some time and it's been in our expectations because what happened is at year-end, we had a couple of clients who have been in the business for a long time like I think 10 plus years predecessors to some of the as we acquired, which were on, like I said, with us for a long time, and they've been moving load to more of a cloud. And so they -- those two churn, absent that, churn was very much in line, in fact, below our normal expectations in the quarter. And I don't see other items like that going forward. In fact, I expect our 2025 churn to be below where we've been historically running. So I usually say something like 1% to 2%, 1.5% to 2% a quarter, which kind of equates to say 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%. This year I would think it's going to be 5% maybe even a little bit lower than that as we look at our book of business. Importantly, we've essentially already released that space, which speaks to the demand environment and the fact that we are heavily leased in terms of our operating portfolio, Kevin, and I'll just also underscore that we're very pleased with the price per kilowatt that we're generating across the portfolio, whether that be on the hyperscale side or colo, which, of course, is this. So thanks for the question, Kevin.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, Barry. I wanted to dive a little bit further into your prepared remarks about organic storage revenues being down sequentially in the fourth quarter. Was it down sequentially on an organic constant currency basis kind of ex FX? And you said something about normal seasonality of a fourth quarter, maybe dive into that. And then you also said something about the consumer business, is that direct-to-consumer business now being deemphasized at Iron Mountain?
Barry Hytinen: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. I'll try to unpack all that here. So what I was explaining was that FX, first and foremost, was a big headwind to us on that line sequentially because as you probably know the US dollar strengthened significantly in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. And in our records business, that's where we are the most diversified from a global footprint, working in 60 plus countries around the world and being exposed to currencies from the euro to the Brazilian real to the Canadian. And the dollar obviously strengthened meaningfully. That's on the order of $10 million sequentially of a headwind quarter-to-quarter. Then on top of that, you're right, we are we have been and we have been very focused on improving the profitability of our Consumer Storage business. You'll recall when we acquired Clutter and put it together with our remaining business, we mentioned that business was losing $2 million or $3 million of EBITDA a quarter. And so what we've done there is we've realized that we shouldn't chase business that's not profitable. And as you know, with any storage business, in and out is not where you want to be. You want to be with things that are going to store long-term. So the team has done a lot of analysis and has focused its both marketing and as well as, where we're targeting on that business to be a much more profitable segment, and we've also driven a lot of operating efficiencies there. So long winded way of saying consumer was also down sequentially. And from a run rate standpoint, that's about nearly 10%. And so when you take those two and put it up against the organic storage rental revenue that you're asking about in total, what falls out is the core records business was up nicely sequentially in line with normal trends and our pricing trends. So we feel very good about where the Records Management business is trending. And having the consumer business now being a profitable run rate is obviously the place we want to be and we'll continue to expand on that. And that helped, obviously, with the Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Barry, can you just, maybe this is a follow-up to what you were explaining to Andrew. But could you talk a little bit about the factors that led to the revenue coming in a little bit lower than you expected in the quarter, right? The guidance was for about $1.6 billion. It was like $1,581 million. If you just rounded it's like 19 lower. Is it that $10 million on FX and $10 million on exiting some stuff in storage or what are the factors, anything in ALM in there? Maybe you could just unpack that for us?
Barry Hytinen: Yes. Shlomo, obviously, you and Anthony have been following the company for a long time. So you're right, it is those two things. It's the FX. And just to be clear, the FX sequentially was even a little bit more than that because, of course, it hits us on other lines. I was specifically speaking about the organic storage rental revenue line. And then the consumer business, we have been very intentional, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. So we are being very focused on driving returns for our shareholders and we're going to continue to do that while growing our business very substantially. We see a tremendous amount of runway there. You mentioned about ALM. ALM performed pretty much right in line with our expectations. The Wisetek and APCD business that we recently acquired did a little bit better than what we were expecting. It was a little north of $20 million. And so we had decent organic growth in the core enterprise pipeline and bookings continuing to grow. And as Bill alluded to, we've booked some very nice enterprise ALM deals here already this year. So feel good about where we're trending and feel very good about where we are in our core records business. Thank you, Shlomo.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. So a question I had about the guidance for -- or expectations for 2025. Anything around capital recycling in your data center portfolio or other as well as any expectations around cash renewal spreads. And then if I could ask also about the land held for development, there's quite a number of markets there across India and Amsterdam and Madrid and Richmond, Northern Virginia, Chicago and so forth. And just anything to highlight in terms of permitting milestones or construction delivery or for long lead time items where you might actually start to develop in some of those markets sooner than others. Thanks.
William Meaney: Thanks for the question, Jon. And I'll -- let me start and then Barry might want to fill in some of the details. But let me start with the back of your question in terms of building the land bank and you know the industry extremely well is that the permitting and access to power is something that is taking longer than used to. But if you look at the year going forward, we feel really good where we're sitting in terms of how we're making progress on getting the land bank ready to lease. If I kind of look at some of the key markets as India, Amsterdam, Madrid, Miami, Chicago, Northern Virginia and also Richmond as we've made, we're on track in terms of our expectations and very consistent with our guide of leasing 125 megawatts this year. So we feel good about the land bank where we are in terms of getting the permitting process through, a lot of that is already through permitting that I just rattled off and relative to our multiyear plan in terms of continuing to grow this business in line with how we've been growing in the last few years and that's showing up in our guidance for 125 megawatts this year, which is a 25% lift on this time last year in terms of where our guide was. In terms of capital recycling, I think, the short answer is we don't have any specific plans around that. One of the things though I would like to highlight is that we've added some more capacity to our design and construction team and we do expect to be able to get more efficiency in terms of our -- how we actually lock up the supply chain for some of the components in our data centers. As we build scale we think that whilst there's always inflation out there is we think that we have now the ability to get more operating leverage in terms of the cost of construction in our data centers this year and that's reflected in our CapEx guide that Barry went through.
Barry Hytinen: Yes. And Jon on cash renewal spreads, probably no surprise, we expect them to continue to rise. And that's just due to where demand is versus where supply is in the industry I think. I would only add that from a standpoint of what we're expecting for a data center the growth that we're seeing is upwards of high 20s, 30% year-on-year from a revenue perspective with all that margin improvement that we were talking about. So we feel very well positioned with respect to growing that portfolio.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-06 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Gillian Tiltman: Thank you, Chuck. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We're joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today to discuss our third quarter results. We delivered another excellent quarter, with record results across all financial metrics of revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. This is a direct result of the portfolio based momentum we have built, which will continue to deliver sustained double-digit growth. During the quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.6 billion, up 12% from the prior year. We also set a new adjusted EBITDA record of $568 million, up 14%. In addition, AFFO per share on a normalized basis was $1.12, up 10% compared to the prior year. Given our strong performance year-to-date, we are now on track to achieve the high end of our full year 2024 guidance range. I'll now turn to an update of our key achievements during the quarter, which are grounded in the following strategic priorities: driving continued revenue growth in our physical storage records management business; delivering differentiated digital solutions, which give truly transformative results to our customers in terms of revenue, cost and cybersecurity; providing asset life cycle management capabilities, which are both economic and environmentally sustainable; and supplying differentiated data center offerings through our global scale and customer trust. Now let me highlight some important wins from the quarter that showcase how we demonstrate the power of our platform. Let's begin with our Records and Information Management business. In Australia, a large government department was looking for a partner that could provide a number of services. We earned their trust and signed a seven year contract delivering storage, digital solutions and asset life cycle management services. Turning to our digital solutions business. This quarter, we launched our InSight Digital Experience, or DXP, a SaaS based platform. DXP allows customers to automate the generation of metadata as well as having the ability to access, manage, govern and monetize physical and digital information. We launched this enhanced platform on August 1, and we have already booked 24 recurring revenue deals. I'll speak to two existing customer wins where we cross sold our DXP offering. Let's start with the customer in Mexico. Due to new requirements in the country for all pension information to be digitized, a longstanding customer turned to Iron Mountain to swiftly gain compliance. We have secured a DXP contract with this large financial services company to sort, digitize and manage their pension records over the next 12 months, comprising more than 50 million images. Secondly, in the U.S., a large healthcare company that has an existing records management and ALM customer will leverage our DXP platform to manage a complex set of multi-format records. By digitizing and migrating this data into our DXP platform, our customer will be able to manage their records more effectively, including the elimination of ineligible claims. This is an example, how the power of our DXP platform drives value for our customers and our unique ability to support their physical and digital information management needs. Turning to our asset life cycle management business. We are pleased with the progress we are making to expand our capabilities and geographic footprint. In Australia, a telecommunications provider needed services for the secured destruction and disposal of e-waste and IT assets. Given our nationwide scale, this customer determined that we are the right partner by handling a high volume of IT hardware efficiently. As a result, Iron Mountain was awarded a recurring contract for these services. In the U.S., our expanded footprint and capabilities following our acquisition of Regency Technologies has resulted in a significant ALM contract with a global technology company. Under this agreement, we will be managing all IT asset disposition services for our customers' U.S. operations, in addition to the records management services that we already provide. The strength of our logistics capabilities was a major factor in winning this contract. Consistent with our strategy to significantly grow our presence in the large and fragmented enterprise asset life cycle management space, we are pleased to announce the acquisition of Wisetek, an end-to-end IT asset disposition company, which will provide us with an expanded footprint across Europe and the United States. We also completed the acquisition of APCD, a leading Australian IT asset disposition specialist. These acquisitions will enable us to continue to expand our reach across a number of categories. Turning to our data center business. I would like to share two examples that demonstrate the continued demand for capacity at our campuses across the world. In Virginia, our team won a second 2 megawatt deal with a global technology company, building on a similar deal with this customer at our data center in Pennsylvania earlier this year. In Arizona, we are supporting a global fintech provider to migrate from an internal data center in a 1.5 megawatt deal with scope for further expansion. Our compliance program was a deciding factor for this highly regulated customer. The leasing achieved in the first three quarters brings us to 106 megawatts compared to the increased guidance for the year of 130 megawatts. To conclude, I'll leave you with three key takeaways. Our strategy is built on the strength of our portfolio of growth businesses, including digital solutions, data center and asset life cycle management, each growing at a CAGR of 20% plus. This coupled with the mid to high-single digit growth of our records management business will continue to deliver consolidated growth in excess of 10% for years to come. This growth is sustained and resilient given it is based upon a portfolio of products and services that meet the current and future needs of our customer base of nearly 250,000 customers, including 95% of the Fortune 1000. And the cornerstone of this strategy is our company's DNA of placing our customers' needs and well-being at the heart of how we serve them. This is all thanks to our dedicated team of Mountaineers. With that, I'll turn it over to Barry to provide more details on our financial results and outlook.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the third quarter, our team delivered strong performance across all of our key financial metrics, including revenue, EBITDA and AFFO. Results for each of those were ahead of the projections we provided on our last call. Our team drove solid performance across all of our business segments, each of which I will discuss in more detail before turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. During the third quarter, we achieved record revenue of $1.56 billion, up 12% on a reported basis, driven by 9% storage growth and 17% service growth. We delivered strong organic growth in the quarter, up 10%. Total storage revenue in the quarter was $936 million, up $77 million year-on-year. We drove 9% organic storage growth, two-thirds of which was driven by revenue management trends in our global RIM business and one-third from our data center business. Total service revenue was $622 million, up $92 million from last year. Organic service revenue growth accelerated to 10% year-on-year. I will note, this represents our best quarterly growth rate for organic service revenue in the last two years. Revenue was driven by strong performance in our ALM and global RIM businesses. Reported service revenue growth at 17.4% reflects the inclusion of our Regency Technologies acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA was $568 million, a new record, up 14% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in our Global RIM, ALM and data center businesses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.5%, up 50 basis points year-on-year, which reflects improved margins across all of our businesses. AFFO was $332 million, up $31 million, which represents growth in excess of 10% for the third quarter of last year -- from the third quarter of last year. Reported AFFO on a per share basis was $1.13, up $0.11 from last year. AFFO per share included a $0.01 benefit due to our GAAP share count in the quarter. Normalizing for that, AFFO per share was up 10% to $1.12, which is comparable to the projection we provided on our last call of $1.10. The outperformance to our guidance was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. As expected, the strength of the U.S. dollar continued to be a headwind, increasingly so toward the end of the quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 13% and AFFO was up 11%. Now turning to segment performance. I'll start with our global RIM business, which achieved revenue of $1.26 billion, an increase of $78 million year-on-year. Organic storage was up in excess of 7%, driven by revenue management and consistent volume. Organic service revenue was also up 7%, with contributions from digital and core services. A key highlight is the performance of our digital business. The team launched the digital experience platform that Bill mentioned, while also delivering their best bookings quarter yet. Consistent with our Matterhorn plan, the vast majority of the digital wins were the result of cross selling. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $569 million, an increase of $52 million year-on-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin was up 120 basis points sequentially and 140 basis points from last year. Margin expansion was driven by operating leverage and revenue management. Turning to our global data center business. The team delivered revenue of $153 million, an increase of $26 million year-on-year. From a total revenue perspective, we achieved 20% organic growth. We delivered storage rental revenue growth of 22% from the third quarter of last year. As expected, service revenue was down slightly this quarter due to the customer specific installation work we had last year. As a reminder, installation revenue tends to be at low to breakeven margins. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $67 million, representing strong growth of 26%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 43.6%, an increase of 190 basis points from the third quarter of last year and up 40 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by pricing, recent commencements and operating leverage. Turning to new and expansion leasing. We signed 9 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 106 megawatts, and we expect to finish the year with 130 megawatts of new leases signed in 2024. Consistent with the strength and expanding nature of our hyperscale customer relationships, together with the outlook for long-term secular growth in the data center industry, we are pleased to announce that we have acquired a development site in Richmond, Virginia. When fully built out, the campus will operate with greater than 200 megawatts of capacity. As this transaction closed in the fourth quarter, it is not included in our supplemental. With this new market, our total data center capacity rises to in excess of 1.1 gigawatts, an increase of over 20%. Turning to asset life cycle management. Total ALM revenue in the quarter was $102 million, an increase of $61 million or 145% year-on-year. On an organic basis, our ALM team delivered strong double-digit growth, which was driven by data center decommissioning and expansion in our enterprise business. Regency Technologies performed very well this quarter with revenue of $36 million. Leveraging Regency's capabilities, capturing synergies related to the deal and improved efficiencies in our data center decommissioning resulted in considerable improvement in ALM profitability. Our focus on cross selling is delivering great results. For example, over 95% of our ALM bookings this quarter were cross sell wins. Regarding the ALM acquisitions that Bill referenced, we closed APCD in August, and it contributed $3 million to revenue. We closed Wisetek in late September, so we had no income statement contribution in the quarter from that acquisition. Turning to capital allocation. We remain committed to our strategy, that is balanced between funding our growth initiatives, while delivering meaningful returns to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $415 million, with $373 million of growth and $41 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.0 times, which is again the lowest level we have achieved since prior to the company's REIT conversion in 2014. For me, a highlight in the quarter was the significant improvement in our cash cycle, with the third quarter having the best performance in that metric in over a decade. Our team drove days sales outstanding down by over five days from the third quarter of last year. Also, we improved days payable by two days. Turning to our dividend. Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.715 per share to be paid in early January. And now turning to our projections. For the full year, we are on track to achieve the high end of our guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $595 million, AFFO of approximately $358 million and AFFO per share of approximately $1.21. In conclusion, our third quarter results represent another milestone on our growth plan. We operate in very large categories, with a total addressable market in excess of $150 billion annually and growing. Iron Mountain has long-standing relationships with nearly 250,000 clients, many measured in decades of duration. And in the vast majority of those relationships, we are only penetrated with a small fraction of our total product offering. We are driving value for our customers, and we are highly focused on cross selling and expanding market share across our businesses. I would like to thank all of my fellow Mountaineers for their efforts to serve our clients and grow our company. And with that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In your ALM business, can you talk a little bit more about trends that you're seeing in the data center and enterprise side of the business, including how much contribution you're seeing from volumes and pricing?
William Meaney: Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. Let me talk about the overall trends. And Barry, I'll ask to comment a little bit on the pricing trends. So as you, I think, alluded to, is that we see good growth or very strong growth coming out of the data center decommissioning (ph), especially where a lot of the hyperscalers are renewing their equipment to take advantage of the latest GPU. So we continue to see strength in that trend. But that's not to ignore the strength in the growth, the volumetric trends that we see also in the enterprise side. But you're right to assume that we see good growth in the hyperscale segment due to the refresh of some of their equipment to take advantage of AI.
Barry Hytinen: And George, it's Barry. I would say from a pricing standpoint, we continue to see -- expect it to trend as I've been discussing throughout the year. It was up some on a year-year basis and trending. However, the spreads between new and second hand of the year have been a little bit variable based on the specific component. So with memory, for example, being a little wider than normal and some of those others being a little tighter. As I've said before, we're not really predicating our guidance on a really meaningful increase in component pricing. And just to give you a perspective on this, our total ALM business was $102 million of revenue, almost $103 million actually in the quarter. As I mentioned, Regency was $36 million, and then we had about $3 million from APCD, which means our organic revenue in the quarter on ALM was about $64 million, and that compares to last year at $42 million. So we are -- to Bill's point, the volume is driving a lot of increase. And with that volume, together with the synergies from our Regency deal, we're seeing the ALM profitability to be up a lot. So we're very pleased with the way our ALM business is trending, George.
George Tong: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you. I wanted to ask about CapEx requirements to kind of fuel the growth going forward. Give us a sense as to how to maybe frame that for the next year? I assume a lot of that would be data centers, but any color on that would be helpful. Thank you.
Barry Hytinen: Hi, Jon. It's Barry. You are correct that in light of the strong growth we continue to see in leasing, we will be continuing to invest significantly in data center growth capital. And in fact, we'll probably be somewhere in the vicinity of a couple of hundred million dollars more growth capital than we were previously expecting earlier in the year in light of the signings. And as you probably saw in our supplemental, we are advancing pretty heavily in some of the construction of all the pre-leased assets. As I've said before, important note is nearly everything that we have under construction is already pre-leased on very, very favorable terms. So our total guidance for capital this year is probably approaching $1.8 billion and with about approaching $150 million of that being recurring. The vast, vast majority of the growth is for data center. And I think you should probably expect something of that order or so going forward in light of the signings that we've had and the amount of capacity we'll be bringing online under those pre-leased agreements. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the pacing of when you expect some of the construction to come on board? It wasn't a ton of sequential revenue growth in the data center business. And obviously, there was a huge signing quarter relative to what we saw in the last couple of quarters. So I want to know if you could just give us -- I know it's lumpy on the signings side. And obviously, you have to put something into commission that you're actually -- the customers using it in order to generate revenue. Can you give us a little bit of an idea of how we should think about that pacing into the fourth quarter? And then in general, over the next year or so, how are -- how is that looking -- are you looking to bring a lot of new capacity or new data centers actually into service?
William Meaney: Yeah. Thanks, Shlomo for the question. So there's a few pieces in there. So let me start, first of all, about the signing this quarter, the 9 megawatts. And as you alluded to, and I think we said in the last call, there was some that kind of we expected in Q3 last time that landed in Q2. We still feel very good with the pipeline that we have to land at 130 megawatts or maybe a little bit better for the year because of lumpiness of some of these large hyperscale contracts that you mentioned. But we're really pleased with the -- these two contracts that we signed or the two that I mentioned on the call, for instance, because these are more co-lo (ph), which obviously attract very high margins. So we feel really good about the overall guidance for the year. I think in terms of the revenue growth and the pickup that you mentioned is the commencements are actually driving this. So we actually see an acceleration of revenue growth, both year-over-year and sequentially as we head into the fourth quarter, which is really going to set us up well as we get the momentum to continue to carry this strong double-digit or in center case, north of 20% CAGR in the growth of that business as we go into 2025. And that's reinforced by the fact that we announced it since the close of the quarter, but in Q4, we've already purchased more land to build out a campus in Richmond, Virginia that Barry mentioned in his remarks. So we feel really good about the setup as we go into 2025. The fourth quarter will be very strong. And I don't know, Barry, if you want to add anything.
Barry Hytinen: Sure. Well, the only other color I suppose I would provide is, you would see in the supplemental that we did commence into revenue generating and finished construction, if you will, on quite a few megawatts. But the vast majority of that was right at the end of the quarter. So it really contributed almost very de minimis amount of revenue to the headline results. And so that's one of the reasons why we have a high degree of visibility to something in the neighborhood of probably $20 million plus or more of incremental data center revenue in the fourth quarter versus the third. That incidentally is up from our prior guidance, so reflecting the fact that our team is doing a great job with keeping construction on budget and on time. And as you would see in the supplemental, we've got quite a few commencements coming over the next couple, three, four quarters. So you should be anticipating ramping levels of data center revenue from us going forward. And I'll just point out that, as we said before, the returns we've been writing have been improving. Pricing, obviously, in data center has been getting better for quite some time now. And so that's one of the reasons why you're seeing the margins step up sequentially, and we expect that trend to continue. So we feel quite good about where we are. Next question?
Operator: Your next question will come from Nate Crossett with BNP. Please go ahead.
Nathan Crossett: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us your expectation for RIM volumes in 4Q? And maybe into next year, what should we expect for RIM pricing? And then one on the Richmond land, is that power provisioned already and maybe when can we see start developments on that site?
William Meaney: Thanks, Nate. Let me start with the Richmond land. Yes, that is power provided. And as we said, that will be north of 200 megawatts of critical IT load, so we're really pleased with that expansion. And I'll let Barry talk about the RIM volume and pricing.
Barry Hytinen: Sure. Hi, Nate. As you would see in the supplemental, we continue to expand our total physical volume in the quarter and we expect that trend to continue certainly in the fourth quarter and going into next year. The team is doing a great job capturing market share and growing our physical volume. Pricing, revenue management, we were clearly focused, as I mentioned, on driving value for our clients and with that value. And I think we're really on provider that can serve clients, especially our larger clients in the ways that we do. And we're offering new offerings that make the value that much higher, things like Smartstore, Image on Demand, our DXP platform among numerous other offerings that drive value for clients. So you would see that the total revenue in global RIM on the storage side was up a little over 7% organic in the quarter, and that was very much in line, in fact, a little bit ahead of what we were expecting as the team continues to do very well driving that value. Thank you. And I would say you mentioned about for next year. Our long-term outlook continues to be that our physical volume will be flattish to slightly up. I see no reason why, at this point, that would be any different next year. And similarly, I think as long as we're continuing to drive value for clients as we are, you should be anticipating our revenue management opportunities to be of the same order that we've been speaking about for some time, which is that mid to upper-single digit. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Good morning, I guess, hey, Barry, I think you talked to kind of revenue and EBITDA at the upper end of the range last quarter too. It looks like you beat by a little bit in the quarter. Any thoughts as to just why it was reaffirmed as opposed to not take it up with one quarter left in the year? Was that FX? Any puts and takes on that?
Barry Hytinen: Hi, Kevin, so good morning. Really appreciate the question. Appreciate the kind words. I would say, we have been saying all year long that what our year guidance was, and we've just taken it to the high end. And frankly, if you work through the guide, you'd find that we're probably going to be a little bit above the high end for revenue and EBITDA based on our fourth quarter projection. And then AFFO and AFFO per share kind of works out to right at the high end of the guidance. Of course, you are right, FX has been a headwind to us all year, probably at least as much of a headwind in the fourth quarter as it was in the third quarter in light of the dollar strength. And I know that it may sound a little bit -- just getting into the weeds, but that may sound a little counter to what you expect when you look at, say, the pound and the euro. But don't forget, we have a fair amount of exposure in Latin America. We've got a great business there. And incidentally, our Latin America business is doing phenomenally well, really growing bookings in our digital business, taking off dramatically in LatAm. But with that, we are exposed to the Argentine peso, the Chilean currencies or the Brazilian real. And so all of those you would see have had a really tough go versus the dollar. So that's disproportionately impacting our revenue and our EBITDA. But look, we feel really good about where we are and our outlook is very favorable. And as we said before, we are running well ahead of our long-term target for a CAGR of 10% that we issued at Investor Day. We're probably running 200 basis points, 300 basis points or more above that for the first few years of that target, and we continue to expect to be at or above those levels and driving considerable profitability. And that is based on -- our growth portfolio that Bill spoke about, we expect that growth portfolio to continue to grow it in excess of 20% for a long period of time. That's ALM, digital and data center, coupled together with the strength of our global RIM business. Next question?
Operator: Next question will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, everybody. Question on InSight. You caught my ear with the 22 wins on the InSight DXP platform. I wanted to know if Iron Mountain is getting revenues for InSight? I know kind of initially that wasn't the strategy, more of a cross sell. So if you're not getting much revenues, what's kind of a typical revenues you're getting from new storage contracts that are bundled with the InSight capability? And if 22 a large number of InSight wins, like, why should we understand this to be important?
William Meaney: Thanks, Andrew. I appreciate the question. So first of all, it's 24, but who's counting, but just -- first of all, we don’t do anything for free. So these are -- when I say highly profitable, these are the typical kind of double-digit service contracts that you're used to watching us. Think of these things, depending on the length of the contract, depending on how much productivity we build in during the length of the contract, but think of them somewhere between 20% and 40% gross margin contracts. The nice thing about these with the DXP platform, not only are we tracking those contracts, I mean, you've been watching the company for a long time, when we start off our digital business is that we were doing relatively little in the area of workflow, much more feeding their data links by the digitization of physical documents. This DXP platform, not only part of it is -- there is a digitization part. But more importantly, when I'm talking about the 20% to 40% margin, depending on the length of the contract, and how much productivity we can build during that course is lots of times, it's taking in data that's completely digital, it's foreign digitally. And we're putting that into our SaaS platform, creating metadata automatically and putting workflow around that. So I think I highlighted the savings bond example. Recently, that was the precursor to DXP, where we took 2 billion microfiche images of historical savings bonds where they couldn't find the owners. And 96% of them we were able to process with the precursor of DXP, which we called InSight and without a person in the loop and identify the owner. So it's that kind of power in this platform. And of course, we've taken it the next step further, and it's a fully SaaS-based platform. But we like the profitability of this business. We really like the growth of the business. And generally, I think you know me well enough. I don't do anything for free.
Operator: Your next question will come from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Thanks. Appreciate you taking the question. Maybe you could just touch on kind of some of your longer-term aspirations with ALM. I know at your Investor Day a couple of years ago, you talked about getting to $900 million or so of revenues by 2026, that's obviously a pretty massive ramp from where you're currently at. So I just wanted to confirm if that's still your stated goal? And maybe how you can kind of bridge from where you're at today, call it, just north of $400 million in annualized revenue to that number, whether it comes from component pricing, volume or incremental M&A that you may or may not do? Thank you.
William Meaney: Let me -- thanks, Eric. I appreciate the question. So I think, yes, we still very much have line of sight to the targets that we set out on Investor Day. Now obviously, that's a combination of organic growth. And as Barry pointed out, we had very, very strong organic growth this quarter. We continue – although, it was up over 50% this quarter, we continue to guide that we can maintain over 20% growth because there's obviously some fluctuation in the pricing of components over time, and we saw that 1.5 years or 2 years ago. But if you look at the volumetric trends that we see in that business, whether it be on enterprise, whether it be on hyperscale data centers or even enterprise data centers decommissioned is the amount of volume because people have a different need as they refresh their equipment than maybe they had 10 years ago, both environmentally and from a security standpoint. We see the volumetric trends. So that's a really strong double-digit growth business. And in addition, we – like, the acquisitions we highlighted that we did in Q3, we see that there's a number of these acquisitions that we'll continue to build. So we feel really good about the targets that we outlined on Investor Day. I don't know, Barry, if you want to add anything.
Barry Hytinen: I think, Eric, the top line target that we provided for the whole company was 10%, and we're obviously running, as I mentioned earlier, a couple of hundred -- 200 basis points, 300 basis points ahead of that. I think our growth portfolio continues to outperform and our global RIM business, also is considerably ahead of where our projections were at that time in the scenario that you're referring to. I'd just underscore, ALM is a really big category. And the TAM there is immense. We're already one of the, if not, the largest player. And I think both from an organic and inorganic standpoint, we can become the market leader in that space. And you saw us doing that both on the organic side as well as with a couple of recent complementary deal. So we feel quite good about ALM. It is very much on track with our strategy for cross selling and driving more value for our clients. Next question, please.
Operator: Next question will come from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I want to stick with the ALM theme. Can you just give us some more details around Wisetek and APCD in terms of their geography and their product offering, maybe the customer focus between enterprise and hyperscale? And also the appetite you have for larger acquisitions, instead maybe some of these bolt-ons?
William Meaney: Thanks, Brendan for the question. So let me -- I'll talk a little bit about the categories and geographies they bring. So Wisetek really helps us expand our portfolio, primarily, in Europe and North America. So they have good presence in both markets. In addition, they also bring strong customer relationships, both on the enterprise, but also we picked up a new hyperscale customer the acquisition of Wisetek, which was great. This is a customer that we have a relationship in some of our other businesses already. But having -- picking up the hyperscale relationship on the ALM side, in addition through the Wisetek acquisition was really great. I think also, obviously, the acquisition we did in Australia does build out our capabilities in Australia, which has always been a strong and important market for Iron Mountain, but it allows us to actually broaden our portfolio of services for our customers there. I don't know, Barry, if you want to talk a little bit more about…
Barry Hytinen: Hi, Brendan. Good morning. We didn't really disclose financial terms on these couple of smaller deals, but I will tell you that, combined, they probably represent in the vicinity of $75 million, $80 million run rate revenue and they -- Wisetek is based in Ireland that has decent sized operations as Bill was mentioning both in Europe as well as U.S. and a little bit in Asia. APCD, as I mentioned, is based in Australia. And the thing about Australia is that's a large data center market, as I know you know, because you follow the data center industry so well. So that is an underpenetrated opportunity for us, both in terms of enterprise as well as decommissioning. And so we feel very good about these opportunities. You've seen what we've been able to do, even still early on with our Regency acquisition. I think all of these create more scale, more capability and more reach for us to serve our global client base much more effectively. And as you mentioned, are we open to larger deals? The thing about this is there's really -- I mean, we're already the larger player. So actually, you get past us and a couple of others that are, say, half our size, they -- all the players that are in space are relatively small, Brendan? So you're thinking like $100 million revenue or less. And so, I don't think you should anticipate anything large in that space. And -- but frankly, we're doing quite well on the organic side, and we're very happy to welcome the team from Wisetek and APCD to our company. So thank you for the questions.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Iron Mountain Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Gillian Tiltman : Thank you, Rocco. Good morning and welcome to our Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Barry Hytinen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor Language on Slide 2, and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William Meaney : Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking the time to join us today for our discussion of our second quarter results. As you saw in this morning's announcement, this quarter delivered another record financial performance and exceeded our expectations. Reflecting on these results, I am incredibly proud of how our team consistently executes at a high level, putting our customers at the center of everything we do. With our proven growth strategy, we are entering the back half of the year with strong momentum. We continue to see firsthand the power of Project Matterhorn from our commercial teams, who are successfully leveraging our full suite of products and solutions to help position Iron Mountain as an ideal partner to our customers. This customer centricity continues to power our results forward for both customers and our shareholders. Building on our track record of value creation for our shareholders and our strong positive outlook, our Board of Directors has authorized an increase of our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.715 in-line with our AFFO per share growth. I'll now turn to key developments during the quarter and how we executed on our growth strategy, which is aligned to our business segments. As a reminder, our strategic priorities are the following. Driving continued revenue growth in our physical storage records management business, providing digitally enabled solutions for our 240,000 customers, which allows them to get true competitive advantage out of their physical and digital information, delivering differentiated data center offerings and offering top-tier growth through our global scale and customer trust, and advancing our asset lifecycle management services which provide security, maximum efficiency, and an environmentally sound lifecycle management approach for our customers' IT assets. To give you some examples of how we have recently applied our services on behalf of our customers, let's begin with our records management business. The first win I wish to highlight shows how our scalable solutions can solve for complex regulatory requirements and address changing customer needs. A European-based pharmaceutical company came to us in need of a global record retention schedule, as the company was struggling to manage costs and meet regulatory requirements. As part of our expanding partnership, we are providing a fully managed suite of solutions, including policy center [upkeep] (ph), advisory services, and a dedicated help desk for queries in a scalable and flexible way that can seamlessly adapt over time as their needs evolve. Continuing with wins in our records management business, I am particularly excited to discuss a couple of digital wins. The first example to highlight is a major contract signed with a large financial institution. The foundation of this win was based upon multiple decades of a trusted relationship with the bank's understanding of our truly differentiated approach to digitally managing and automating workflow. As a result, they selected Iron Mountain to serve as its partner for a long-term transformation of its management of digital and physical documents. On the bank's behalf, Iron Mountain is transforming how it captures both digital and physical documents and their associated metadata across all lines of business, including non-banking internal documents like finance and HR. Our unique offering revolutionizes document processing services for both physical and digital documents. We have achieved this by employing our proprietary leading edge, AI powered intelligent document processing built into our InSight platform. Continuing with our digital business in Australia we have secured a large deal with one of the country's biggest banks to provide our Digital Mailroom solution, which brings together our operational scale and digital capabilities. Iron Mountain has been a trusted records management partner for over 20 years, and we built on that relationship to develop a comprehensive service offering that will see us manage their physical Mailroom sites across Australia and scan around 32 million images a year, as we process mortgage documents, checks, vouchers, and other banking documents. Our proven implementation methodology reassured the customer that we could execute a seamless transition of services and the innovative technology we are deploying will help them to realize significant efficiencies in the years ahead. Moving to our data center business, through the first half of the year, we leased 97 megawatts, which includes 66 megawatts this quarter. Due to our strong pipeline, we feel confident we will exceed our original projection and now expect to lease 130 megawatts for the year. The speed of leasing in the first half of the year is thanks to the momentum that our team has built in our leasing pipeline. We are an attractive partner to customers looking for infrastructure, which can support their very dense IT workloads and associated with their AI enabled services. Here are some examples of wins during the quarter from our US and UK markets. At our Western Pennsylvania location, we welcomed a new hyperscale customer with a seven-year contract. Since signing the contract, the customer is already in discussions about potential expansion to some of our other campuses. A good example of our continued and growing partnerships with some of the largest hyperscalers, our recent wins this quarter with a single customer in both the US and UK markets. This customer has placed a 10-year contract for us with us for almost 25 megawatts of capacity at our London data center campus and a 15-year contract for 36 megawatts at our data center campus in Phoenix, Arizona. Also at our Phoenix campus, we have won a 10-year co-location contract with one of Japan's largest banks. We will be providing 800 kilowatts of capacity to support the complete transformation of this customer's North American IT platform. Turning to our asset lifecycle management business, we continue to see established Iron Mountain customers seek new solutions from our ever-expanding portfolio. A perfect example of this is how we expanded a relationship with an insurance company that has been an Iron Mountain customer since the late 1950s. Having secured a small ALM project with them last year, our customers confidence in our capabilities and our delivery record has led them to make us their sole ALM provider. Finally, I'd like to share a last example of a customer that has added our ALM services to the Iron Mountain Solutions from which they already benefit. This global cloud-based software company has asked us to manage an ALM program to securely destroy, remarket or recycle data center assets at more than 30 locations in North America, EMEA, Latin America, and the Asian Pacific regions. Demonstrating we can provide a full service global ALM offering is no small task, but our skilled and dedicated teams successfully met the challenge. We are now a proud ALM partner for this customer, alongside the records management and digital solutions that we already provide. To conclude, we have thoughtfully and strategically curated a mountain range of best-in-class solutions and an effective operating model under Project Matterhorn. This quarter's successes are a brief testament to the value our strategy is already delivering and a window into the future we are building at Iron Mountain. As we continue to expand our footprint of storage and services and deliver tailored, innovative solutions for each of our customers, I could not be more grateful for the hard work of our Mountaineers. Our strategy and execution is showing the way in delivering consistently strong revenue growth in the resulting financial model that delivers top tier growth in both our AFFO and our dividend. We have an energized team of experienced, proven operators who are committed to excellence, and that gives us great confidence in our future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen : Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. I'll begin by providing an overview of our second quarter results, and then go into more detail on each of our business segments before turning to our outlook for the third quarter, the full year. In the second quarter, our team achieved strong performance across all of our key financial metrics. We achieved record revenue of $1.534 billion, up 13% on a recorded basis driven by 11% storage growth and 17% service growth. We delivered 10% organic revenue growth. Revenue was ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call by more than $30 million. Total storage revenue was $920 million up $89 million year-on-year. Storage growth was driven by revenue management and continued strong commencements in our data center business. Total service revenue was $615 million up $87 million from last year, driven by strength in our asset lifecycle management and global RIM businesses. Adjusted EBITDA was $544 million a new record, up 14% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in global RIM, as well as data center and asset lifecycle management. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.5% up 50 basis points year-on-year, which reflects improved margins across our business. AFFO was $321 million or $1.08 on a per share basis, up $34 million and $0.10 respectively from the second quarter of last year. This represents growth of 12% for AFFO and 10% for AFFO per share. This is ahead of the guidance we provided for the second quarter, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, as well as lower than expected cash taxes, which is included in our guidance for the third quarter. The strength of the US dollar continued to be a headwind in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 14% and AFFO was up 13%. Now turning to segment performance. I'll start with our global RIM business, which achieved revenue of $1.25 billion, an increase of $91 million year-on-year with strong organic revenue growth of 7.9%. Revenue management and positive volume trends drove organic storage rental growth of 7.7%. Our team delivered organic service revenue up 8.3%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $549 million, an increase of $50 million year-on-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin was up 40 basis points sequentially and 90 basis points from last year driven by storage growth and continued productivity across our operations. Turning to Global Data Center, the team delivered revenue of $153 million, an increase of $35 million year-on-year. From a total revenue perspective, we achieved 24% organic growth. Organic Storage Rental revenue growth was particularly strong at 27% driven by commencements and improved pricing. GAAP mark-to-market in the second quarter was 12.3% and was benefited by a single relatively large renewal. We continue to expect mark-to-market to be up mid-to-high single digit in the second half. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $66 million representing 23% growth. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we signed 66 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings for the first half to 97 megawatts. As Bill mentioned, with our strong leasing and favorable outlook, we are increasing our full-year projection to 130 megawatts. The data center market continues to develop rapidly, and with our strong and expanding hyperscale relationships, our pipeline continues to grow. I am pleased to report that we have increased our land bank by 57 megawatts. With those additions, our total data center capacity can now be built out to 918 megawatts over time with 347 megawatts held for development. Turning to Asset Lifecycle Management. Total ALM revenue in the quarter was $90 million, an increase of 111% year-on-year and 30% on an organic basis driven by both improved volume and pricing. ALM continues to be a key beneficiary of cross-selling with over 95% of our bookings this quarter happening as a result of that initiative. The team at Regency Technologies continues to deliver results ahead of our plan with revenue of $35 million in the quarter. We have seen our combination with Regency result in expanded client relationships and improved profitability. Turning to capital allocation, we remain focused on a disciplined approach to fund our growth initiatives and drive meaningful shareholder returns, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $399 million with $360 million of growth and $37 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.0 times, which is the lowest level we have achieved since prior to the company's REIT conversion in 2014. Turning to our dividend. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 60%. Consistent with our target payout range and reflecting our positive outlook, we have increased our dividend 10%. Now turning to our projections. For the full year, we now expect to deliver results towards the high end of our guidance range on all metrics. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.55 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $560 million, AFFO of approximately $325 million, and AFFO per share of approximately $1.10. In conclusion, our team delivered record results in the first half. We continue to perform ahead of our long-term growth objectives, and our outlook is strong. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of our Mountaineers for their continued efforts to deliver on behalf of our customers. And with that operator, would you please open the line for Q&A?
Operator: Absolutely. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: All right, thanks. Good morning. Your ALM business saw 30% organic revenue growth in the quarter. Can you discuss how much of the growth came from volumes versus pricing and what assumptions for component prices you're baking into your guidance.
William Meaney: Thanks, George, and good morning. Let me handle the first part, and then I'll let Barry talk a little bit more about the pricing trends that we're seeing. So first, we're really pleased with the growth, in the organic growth that you highlighted in our ALM business this quarter. And you think about that, about two-thirds of that is driven by just pure volume. And the other third is the price improvement that we've seen from the record lows that were 12 months, 18 months ago. So we're really pleased with the progress. But I'd say most of the growth is from volume.
Barry Hytinen: And, George, from a standpoint of what we're seeing in our view for pricing going forward is, as you'd know pricing continues to be expected to trend higher. We've been somewhat conservative with respect to our outlook for pricing because we've seen some variation between the spreads between new gear and secondary gear, particularly so on memory. It's widened some, but frankly, it's narrowed those spreads on other gear like drives. So, you know, look it's a very positive outlook for our ALM business because the team continues to win a lot of business. The cross-selling activity we have is immense. And we are expecting, if you work through the guidance we just gave for the third quarter and implied for the fourth, you should be expecting our ALM business to be comping organically in the 40s in the back half, if not higher. So we're feeling really good and I guess I should just call out, since you asked about ALM, our Regency business is doing phenomenal. The team there continues to execute very, very well. We are seeing very strong productivity as a result of leveraging Regency’s capabilities and their utilization is going up, thanks to historic Iron Mountain business that's being processed by regency. So thank you, George.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Kevin McVeigh, UBS. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Congratulations on the record results. Yes. I don't know if it is for Barry or -- can you reconcile kind of the two quarters of beat relative to the reaffirmed guidance and just the optimism that it seems like it is scaling on the ALM side. Just puts and takes around that.
Barry Hytinen: Yes. Kevin. Good morning. We continue to feel very good, as we just noted about our guidance, and as you know, we beat in the first quarter, and we beat again here in the second quarter, actually a wider beat than the first. And our thought process is that things continue to trend very much in the right direction. That's why we pointed to the higher end of our guidance range for the year. I will note FX continues to be a headwind, so you will see the stronger dollar be an impact to our reported results in the third quarter probably of the order of the same magnitude as the second quarter, if not a little bit more. But what you are seeing is, improving trends as compared to our initial outlook this year across the business. Global RIM continues to perform really well in the organic storage rental revenue growth accelerated in the quarter, as we expected it to and as we forecasted last quarter, and we continue to expect that to be in the 7% to 8% range in the back half. And then in terms of data center, as we talked about before, that's a business that has a tremendous amount of visibility in the near-term. And as we talked about the outlook for the long term, there is very robust in light of the leasing activity we've had. And I just mentioned ALM with George. So I appreciate the question.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Nate Crossett of BNP. Please go ahead.
Nate Crossett: Hi, good morning. Just wondering what you are expecting in terms of overall RIM volumes for 3Q in the balance of the year? And then can you -- I guess, you already talked about your expectations for pricing growth. So should we assume that the organic revenue growth is 7% to 8% in the back half?
Barry Hytinen: Hi, Nate, it's Barry. Consistent with our outlook for the last many quarters, we continue to expect our physical volume to be flattish to slightly up. And it continued that trend obviously, in the second quarter, and we have a favorable outlook for it again to be in that vicinity in the third and in the fourth quarter. So we expect our volumes to be continuing to rise. I'll just note we have never stored more physical volumes than we are storing today. And so that is, I think, a testament to the team's diligence, as it relates to serving our customers. And frankly, the value we are driving for customers, as they continue to trust us with their important assets. In terms of organic growth in RIM on the storage side, you’ve got it right. So the volume would be a relatively small component of the growth and then the rest would be driven principally by revenue management. And I’ll note that our services business in Global RIM continues to be benefited both on the traditional side, but also and going forward likely to be ramping some on the digital side, because the team in our Digital Solutions Group just delivered the best bookings quarter we’ve ever had in digital. So that is a really nice performance by our commercial and digital teams. Thanks, Nate.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Alexander Hess: This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. I hope you are all well today. A quick question on data center CapEx. And then maybe a quick follow-up. On data center CapEx, do the assumptions that you guys made at Investor Day -- your investor event in 2022 still hold. Obviously, we're seeing notable pickup in the guided CapEx numbers from the hyperscalers. And then maybe a structural question. Has the pool of hyperscalers, are those still say, the same firms for you guys as three years or four years ago? Or is there opportunity for some of these infrastructure software and AI start-ups to also be hyperscalers in your book as well? Thank you.
William Meaney: Good morning. I'll start with your second question and then Barry will follow up on the CapEx relative to our Investor Day. So I think what you see for us, hyperscalers are always kind of not just the largest cloud providers, but the largest SaaS providers as well. So people who need very, very large deployments in terms of megawatts of data center capacity. And usually, these are global firms. So I'm not saying that we won't see some of those firms -- some of the more newer firms that you are highlighting come into that fold, but I’d say, that the barriers to entry for these really very large hyperscalers just given the cost of leasing and building data centers. It is a fairly consolidated in tight group. I'm not saying that there couldn't be people that break into it, but I think for the moment, it's a pretty stable group, slightly increasing as some of the SaaS players get bigger in their own right.
Barry Hytinen: Alex, it is Barry. I’d say, a couple of thoughts about your question on the CapEx use. We are continuing to see our data center business and actually the whole business run ahead of the expectations we shared at that Investor Day. As we talked about last quarter, for the first couple of years, we were well ahead. And if you look at what we are doing here this year, we are actually accelerating that level of beat. So we are generating more revenue, more EBITDA and more cash generation. And certainly, we continue to lease more and faster than we were indicating at the time of the Investor Day. So over time, I think it’s possible that we may see a continued ramp in capital for data center. But I'll just note, we are constructing to leases with some of the best quality tenants you could imagine in the hyperscalers. And I mean a couple of statistics, we are 96% leased in our operating portfolio and in our under development construction portfolio which is about 10% bigger than what we are operating, maybe even 15% bigger than we're operating, we're 96% leased on that as well on a pre-lease basis. So I will just underscore that when we are putting capital to work to build out our data center platform, it is because we have already signed contracts with clients, and we’re very pleased with the level of returns that we have been generating on those deals.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question from comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Thanks. Appreciate it. Just a follow-up on the data center conversation. I mean just based on all the opportunity you've had, the outperformance on leasing year-to-date. Maybe you could just talk about funding sources going forward. And given the fact that your stock has been so strong this year, your equity cost of capital is significantly lower than it has been in years past. Does this issuing equity enter the conversation going forward, as you look at funding the data center business? Thank you.
William Meaney: Thanks, Eric. Let me start and then Barry may want to chime in as well. So first, we feel really good about, as you are highlighting, the growth and momentum that we are building in the data center business. And just in the colo, but more and more in the hyperscale and the majority is coming from hyperscale. But as Barry said, it is -- well over 90% like around 96% is all pre-leased and it is a fully funded plan as we highlighted in Investor Day. So we don't see any -- we feel really good in terms of the way that we are able to fund the growth. And so we are happy in terms of the trajectory that we have without going out and raising equity. I think we have a plan that works.
Barry Hytinen: Eric, I’d just add that if you look going forward, likely rates are probably coming down over time. So that makes it that much easier for us. And the business is so cash generative from the core. And as you see, the [covering] (ph) business continues to deliver outstanding results. So I think from a standpoint of your point about the equity has risen a bit, that is true. But I think that's more a function of where it was. And if you look at us on a multiple versus the growth we're putting up I think that bolsters the point Bill was just making as it relates to equity. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to touch on two items, if I may. One, just on ALM, are you seeing the hyperscalers starting to really open up the inventory of gear that they had and really starting to sell it? Or are you still starting -- seeing the hesitation in case prices rise more. What I'm trying to understand is, are they starting to actually dump the stuff that they've been holding on to? And then just second, just if you can comment, Barry, on the storage gross margin had increased by 20 basis points sequentially, but the moving parts are very interesting, where you had like all other storage costs up like $10 million, but you had a rent to actually go down $2 million sequentially. Maybe you could talk about what the movements over there, how did rent go down? And what are those other storage costs that are going up?
William Meaney: Good morning. Shlomo. So I will take the question on the ALM and then Barry can talk to you a little bit about the takes in terms of storage costs. So on the ALM side, is the hyperscale is the reticence that you might have seen last year that I think we commented from the hyperscalers was less to do with the pricing on the components. It was more the availability of new kit that they had to actually refresh their data centers. And I think you've seen all the reporting from some of the largest hyperscalers in the last couple of weeks that you are all ramping up their refresh of their data centers to bring in the most capable GPUs, so that they are AI ready, and they can build up some of their AI Services. So we do see an uptick, to your point in the volume that we're getting from the hyperscalers, but it's driven more because they are refreshing their data centers to be more AI enabled and they're able to get the latest GPUs from the supplier, so they are able to accelerate some of that. So we do see a building volume from the hyperscalers right now in terms of decommissioning, which leads to more ALM volume in our business.
Barry Hytinen: Shlomo, it is Barry. A couple of thoughts about the storage rental gross margin. First of all, we were really pleased with that at 70% and that being because really, if you look at our global RIM business, it was up very nicely year-on-year. Of course part of that revenue management, part of that is the continued productivity that our operations teams are driving. And so the reason it was slightly down year-on-year is related to, as I talked about hour, as well as data center. As we've talked about sometimes before, data center is a lower gross margin, but it is, of course accretive to our EBITDA margin. And so as data center continues to ramp at a very fast rate, it has a little bit of a level of mix. But obviously, it is very incremental. And on a sequential basis, you would expect on that all other storage costs, there to be some power inflation as commencements begin to ramp and folks start to drop out, if you know that -- that's a direct pass-through. So it can actually also affect rate. So to have the storage gross margin up sequentially in light of that headwind is we thought very favorable about that. On the storage rent expense it was down some sequentially, and that's thanks to our team's continued productivity around warehouse efficiencies. We have -- as you would have seen over the last few quarters, reduced some of our warehouses and thereby gotten to a better expense position. And the only other thing I'll mention is taking it up a level. Our gross margin in the quarter for the whole company was almost just under 56%. Now that's slightly down from last year. But two things to think about. One, we are absorbing the mix issues, including the power that I mentioned in that number. And two, we've added Regency Technologies, which is, again, a mixed headwind on gross margin, but by the way Regency performed extraordinarily well on EBITDA in the quarter. And so we feel really good about where the gross margin is trending and it’s been ahead of our expectations.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. It came up a little bit already. But on the pricing front, your organic constant currency growth was 7.7% for storage rentals, up quarter-to-quarter, but down relative to the 2023 pace. I think you guys have one suggested mid-single digit pricing growth which is possible over the next couple of years. But you've been at high single digits for a few years now. Is it transition to mid-single digits occurring now? And how should we think about you guys pushing price as inflation wanes?
Barry Hytinen: Brendan, we were very pleased with the 7.7%. And I think at that level, you can see the amount of EBITDA the business generates since it is a highly productive portion of our company. And as it relates to trending, we have indicated we feel like mid-to-upper single is the right kind of level over the longer term. And so I’d say, it trending in this vicinity is -- would be very positive to the business model going forward.
William Meaney: Yes. And the only thing I would add is that it isn't so much inflation-based anymore. It's really about the value that we are adding to our customers. So if you look at our traditional records management business, is we've over the last few years have added a portfolio of services such as Smart Sort, Smart Reveal, and I highlighted on the call some of the governance and compliance consulting and systems that we are able to install around their hard records management. And so we are really driving more value for our customers and the customers see value in that. So I think you can continue to expect that our pricing will remain some 300 basis points to 400 basis points ahead of what you would think is normal inflation, but it is really driven by the value that our customers see from our services.
Barry Hytinen: Brendan, the only other thing I'll add is that at the start of the year, we had suggested Global RIM might be in the vicinity of 6%, total growth for the year. And so year-to-date, we are running 7.5% on that business. So we continue to see outperformance in Global RIM. Some of that is driven off of revenue management, also incremental service uptake of the sort that Bill just mentioned.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.
Jon Atkin: Thanks. A couple of questions. Can you talk a little bit about ALM and to what extent Regency is sort of fully occupied? Or do you have the opportunity within that set of assets to see more productivity. And then secondly, on data centers, if there is anything to call out in terms of lead times around construction and delivery and the conversion of book-to-bill. Thank you.
William Meaney: Good morning Jon. Let me start with the data center piece and then Barry can talk about Regency and more broadly, the ALM business and operating leverage. So on the data center side, is you are right to highlight the lead times for a lot of the build components, including the concrete panels or the actual physical construction of the shelf. The good news is that we've been able to manage that and keep the lead times similar to historical norms and what our customers are expecting because as we're building scale in our data center business, we're standardizing across a lot of those components in market, right? So across some of the like Europe versus the United States, you can't standardize as much. But within Europe, you can standardize a lot. Within the United States, you can standardize a lot. India, you can standardize a lot, et cetera. So we are doing that. And what that allows us to do is as we get scale is to be much more flexible in terms of having the right equipment for the right customer in the right location. So we feel pretty good in terms of our ability to manage the supply chain and keep our timing intact?
Barry Hytinen: Jon, this is Barry. As it relates to Regency and the opportunity to continue to utilize and optimize further, it’s definitely there. There is a lot of opportunity. We have considerable capacity to expand the business, both in terms of what is already in place, as well as the opportunity to expand the footprint at relatively low CapEx, I might add. So it's a very positive situation to be having Regency get further utilized which I expected to over time. And I’ll say, we have a very highly capable team at Regency that there is no doubt, can manage a much larger business and drive a tremendous amount of value for our shareholders.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thanks for squeeze me in for one more. This is a little bit more of a technical one also. It looks like the real estate depreciation went up sequentially by like $14 million. Was there a major site that team on Board during the quarter?
Barry Hytinen: Shlomo, you should expect the depreciation, of course to continue to ramp with all of the CapEx we've been doing on data center as well as some of our incremental new warehouses that we put in as well as some of the digital innovation that we’ve been driving internally for some time now. So that is the primary driver, and it is in those that order.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Gillian Tiltman: Thanks, Rocco. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A.
 Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information.
 And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. 
William Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today. We are pleased to report that our team has delivered outstanding results for the first quarter of 2024, achieving another set of all-time highs for revenue and profitability. Our continued progress is evidence of the success of Project Matterhorn and our team's commitment to delivering best-in-class solutions.
 On a reported basis, in the first quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.48 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth and a new first quarter adjusted EBITDA record of $519 million, delivering 13% year-over-year growth. Project Matterhorn has successfully transformed Iron Mountain into a solutions-based business with a commercial organization that offers a broad range of products and services to meet the evolving needs of our customers.
 This integrated product portfolio drives strong growth across all business areas through our integrated solutions, combining storage with truly differentiated services. Now I'd like to take you through some pivotal wins this quarter. Let's begin with records and information management.
 The strength and longevity of the relationships we have built with our 240,000 customers is leading to further opportunities to offer more solutions from our portfolio to meet our customers' needs. An excellent example of this cross-selling is in the oil and energy sector where a U.S.-headquartered customer with a presence in 75 countries initially selected Iron Mountain to securely manage its data containing geological information.
 Thanks to our expanded range of solutions and a deep understanding of the customers' needs, we are now also providing a secure IT asset disposition solution.
 Another example of our strength and ability to cross-sell and provide more solutions for our customers is in the United Arab Emirates. For the past 2 years, we have been partnering with a prominent bank to provide records management services for a growing volume of documents. With this customer's need to comply with regulations from the UAE Central Bank, we secured an agreement to extend our solutions. These now include document capture and asset life cycle management or ALM services.
 We continue to see opportunities to support government and public sector organizations with their transformations, helping them to increase efficiency and demonstrate value for money for the sources they provide to their citizens. A recent example of this is in the U.K., where we have a long-term relationship with a government agency that trust us to store approximately 18 million records. This customer awarded Iron Mountain a contract to manage documents that must be retained whilst legal proceedings are ongoing.
 Our proven ability to manage records effectively to this customer and a number of other government organizations in the U.K. demonstrates we have the skills, capabilities and experience to successfully manage sensitive projects like this.
 Turning to our digital business, a global customer that provides automation solutions has asked us to digitize its physical records in Morocco. Our InSight platform, which as you will recall, fully integrates both artificial intelligence and machine learning will enable this customer to simplify their current use of multiple information systems and content formats.
 InSight will enable them to derive greater value from their information whilst improving their compliance and driving greater operational efficiencies. The customer's confidence in our solution is a testament to our team's clear understanding of our customers' needs as well as our proven track record of success as a digital transformation partner.
 Staying with digital solutions, an Australian government agency asked Iron Mountain to digitize approximately 250,000 land registry files dating back to the 1850s for government-owned real estate in the state of Victoria. Our solution will ensure that these vital historical records are preserved both physically and digitally, enabling efficient access for land managers, potential developers and government departments.
 Our infrastructure, reputation and expertise, including our ability to meet a requirement to manage the entire project within the state of Victoria were key differentiators that enabled us to secure this deal.
 Moving next to our data center business. We continue to be pleased by the strength and rapid growth of this business and how we can support more customers with the capacity we are creating at our facilities around the world. Today, I want to highlight 3 examples of leases we signed this quarter.
 First, we have signed a 24-megawatt 12-year contract with a global technology company for data center space at our Manassas, Virginia campus. This is an existing North American records customer that required space in Virginia to support their high-performance computing needs and to expand their footprint. Also this quarter, we leased 4 megawatts with an existing global cloud storage customer. The customer relate to us that our excellent customer service was a key determinant in their decision to expand their footprint with us.
 Additionally, in our data center business, we are pleased to welcome a global IT consulting firm as a new customer. They chose us in order to be in close proximity to their clients as well as to meet their demanding connectivity requirements.
 Turning to asset life cycle management. We are pleased to share that this quarter, we closed the acquisition of Regency Technologies. The Regency leadership team have already made strong contributions to our ALM efforts, both commercially and operationally and have integrated well into our company. Moreover, Regency adds 8 complementary locations to our U.S. network.
 Moving to ALM more broadly. We are pleased with strong organic growth in the business, driven by a combination of increased volume and component price recovery leading to a strong quarter. As we continue to build our ALM capabilities, I wish to share several examples of how ALM enables us to offer more solutions to new and existing customers.
 A well-known food service brand has signed an agreement with Iron Mountain in the Netherlands to recycle their decommissioned IT assets. Data security was paramount in their decision to partner with Iron Mountain as well as our ability to be at any of their in-country locations within 48 hours. Also in this quarter, an existing Iron Mountain global financial institution customer signed a program deal to manage their secure ITAD, recycling and remarketing requirements, including their remote workplace inventory for over 400 sites nationwide.
 The customer wanted a single vendor approach to streamline their asset life cycle management. We worked with them on a unique solution that created process and workflow enhancements, integrated with their existing asset management systems and lowered their overall cost through the remarketing initiatives. The program supports all of their corporate locations with both on and off-site ALM services.
 Finally, a multinational conglomerate company has signed a deal with us to manage its ALM needs for data center decommissioning as well as their end user devices. Due to the customers' significant growth through acquisition, they had accumulated a significant amount of legacy data center and end-user device equipment that needed to be securely decommissioned. We were pleased to be able to provide a holistic global solution backed by our secure chain of custody in order to meet their needs.
 To conclude, I am very proud of the strong results our Mountaineers continue to deliver. Our consistently strong performance, including our ability to achieve our highest quarterly revenue to date is evidence of the increasing heights we are achieving as part of our Matterhorn climb.
 At the core of this continued strong performance is our customers. All of us at Iron Mountain are humbled by the trust which more than 240,000 organizations around the world including 95% of the Fortune 1000 have in us in our increased portfolio of services. We look forward to continuing our growth journey as we deliver our best-in-class and integrated solutions to our clients and create value for our shareholders.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry. 
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the first quarter, our team continued our track record of strong performance, exceeding the expectations we've provided on our last call.
 We achieved record quarterly revenue of $1.48 billion, up 12% on a reported basis, driven by 9% storage growth and 17% service growth. On an organic basis, revenue grew 8%. Revenue was nearly $30 million ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call, driven by stronger performance in both our Global RIM and our asset life cycle management businesses.
 Total storage revenue of $885 million, up $75 million year-on-year was driven by solid performance from both Global RIM and data center. Total service revenue of $592 million was up $88 million from last year, reflecting strength in Global RIM and digital as well as strong contribution from our recently closed acquisition of Regency Technologies.
 For me, 2 key highlights in the quarter are: first, data center storage revenue exceeded 30% growth year-on-year. And second, our organic service revenue growth accelerated to 10% year-on-year, primarily driven by improved performance in our asset life cycle management business. Adjusted EBITDA was $519 million, an increase of $58 million from last year. This constitutes growth of 13%, both on a reported and constant currency basis year-on-year, driven by strong contributions across all business units.
 Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.1%, consistent year-on-year driven by revenue management and cost productivity, offset by mix. AFFO was $324 million or $1.10 on a per share basis, up $29 million and $0.09, respectively, from the first quarter of last year. This was ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call as a result of the upside in adjusted EBITDA as well as phasing of both recurring capital investments and cash taxes, which is incorporated into our guidance for the second quarter.
 Now turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.21 billion, an increase of $84 million from last year. On a reported and organic basis, revenue grew 7%. Storage rental revenue growth of 6% reflects our focus on revenue management and consistent volume trends. We delivered service revenue growth of 10%, driven by traditional services and digital solutions.
 Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $526 million, an increase of $48 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business. We achieved revenue of $144 million, an increase of $32 million and 28% year-on-year. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $62 million or 22% growth from the first quarter of 2023.
 Turning to new and expansion leasing. We had a successful quarter with the team signing 30 megawatts with strong cross-selling activity. Our data center pipeline is robust across the markets we serve. In Phoenix, where we are fully leased in our first 2 sites, we have now commenced construction on our third site and have a considerable pipeline of opportunities to fill it.
 In support of our data center strategy and consistent with our sustainability commitments, we were pleased to execute our first green loan in April. This $300 million financing was well received and considerably oversubscribed. Proceeds will be used to support the construction of energy-efficient data centers in Northern Virginia.
 Turning to asset life cycle management. In the first quarter, we delivered improved performance for both revenue and EBITDA. Total ALM revenue in the quarter was $84 million, an increase of 103% year-on-year. Regency Technologies performed ahead of our expectations in the quarter with revenue of $32 million.
 While we are only 1 quarter into the integration, we are very pleased with the acquisition and are already seeing more benefit than planned in terms of cross-selling, increased capabilities and improved operational efficiencies. On an organic basis, ALM revenue increased 25% year-on-year, driven by both improved component pricing and increased volume from our strong cross-selling activity.
 Turning to capital. In the first quarter, we invested $366 million, of which $337 million was growth and $29 million was recurring. Our full year capital expenditure target remains $1.35 billion of growth and $150 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1x.
 As a reminder, this remains at the lowest level in the past decade. We expect to operate within our target leverage range, which is 4.5 to 5.5x. Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share to be paid in early July. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 61% at the lower end of our long-term target range of low to mid-60s percent.
 And now turning to our forecast. With our positive outlook, we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance despite the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Our forecast today includes current FX rates, which results in an incremental headwind of approximately $25 million to revenue and approximately $10 million to adjusted EBITDA through the remainder of the year as compared to our initial guidance.
 For the second quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $535 million, AFFO of approximately $310 million and AFFO per share of approximately $1.05. In summary, we are pleased to have delivered strong first quarter results, and we expect continued growth in 2024 as a result of our focus on Project Matterhorn objectives.
 I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank our entire team for their continued dedication and commitment to Iron Mountain and our clients. And with that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. 
Keen Fai Tong: Within the storage business, organic revenue growth step to 7.5% in the quarter compared to about 10.5% in 4Q. Presumably, most of that was driven by changes in price realization since volumes are generally stable in storage. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing with your revenue management strategy and your latest traction with price realization in the quarter and expectations for the remainder of the year? 
William Meaney: Thanks, George. It's Bill, and I appreciate you joining the call. The -- so let me start with kind of the macro view. So we're really very pleased with our storage, both in terms of the records management as well as in the data center side because you can see we're continuing to grow. We've never stored on the traditional side or the records management side, we've never stored more documents than we do today.
 So we're really pleased with the continued strength of the volume and the growth and the volume on the data center side. In terms of pricing, you can appreciate that we -- as we go through the year, that ramp. So you should think about that as being kind of the low point. But I don't know, Barry, you might want to add a little bit more color to it? 
Barry Hytinen: George, thanks for that question. Bill's got it right there on the revenue management within Global Rim. The timing of revenue management actions year-on-year is such that there was a bit of a shift in the first quarter. Last year, we had more of the revenue management actions in place right at the beginning of the year. And this year, we're back to our more normal cadence of kind of the Mark's time frame, generally speaking, in terms of getting them all into the market and realized.
 As it relates to how it performed, though in Global RIM for storage rental revenue growth is actually, to be clear, ahead of our expectations on the lines you're asking about. And in total, we delivered 7.5% total revenue growth in Global RIM. You'll recall last quarter, we mentioned that our guide for the whole year, assuming Global RIM at about 6%. So we're starting very well. There was upside in Global RIM principally driven off of services, but a little bit ahead, as I mentioned, on storage rental and of course, data centers off to a really strong start.
 So we feel very well positioned with respect to where we started the year, George, on both revenue management, total storage revenue as well as the full enterprise results. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Nate Crossett with BMP. 
Nathan Daniel Crossett: Maybe just a follow-up to that. What is your expectation for RIM volumes for 2Q and the balance of the year? And then data center leasing guidance, is it still 100-megawatt? And maybe you could just talk about the pipeline for data center. 
William Meaney: Okay. Thanks, Nate. I'll give you the -- in terms of volume, we continue -- it's a rock-solid business in terms of RIM volume, and we continue to see that to flat, slightly up. So we don't see any change, and you can see that in our supplemental, we don't see any change in that trend, and we continue to feel really good about that.
 And in terms of the pipeline on data center, it's extremely strong. You see we're off to a good start. We guided 100 megawatts for the full year. We're 30 megawatts in the first quarter, and we have a very strong pipeline as Barry alluded to in terms of Arizona, for instance, in terms of building out the third site in Phoenix.
 But across the globe, we have a very, very strong pipeline. So we're expecting another very strong year, benefiting from the strong macro environment around data centers, especially with the growth around AI applications. 
Barry Hytinen: And Nate, the only -- this is Barry. The only thing I would add is -- building on to Bill's point there at the beginning on volume. We are forecasting for volume to be up second quarter versus the first quarter. And consistent to slightly up for the full year as we've been saying for some time we're well on track with that forecast. And just as a reminder, we have never stored more physical volume than we are storing today. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. 
Brendan Lynch: Maybe we could start just by disaggregating the ALM components between increased volume and improvement pricing? 
Barry Hytinen: Brendan, it's Barry. Thanks for that question. If we look at total ALM, we had $84 million of revenue. Now Regency, which, as you know, we just recently acquired was just over $32 million of revenue, as I mentioned on the prepared remarks. So that -- and by the way, that was very good performance. So that's on a run rate of nearly, let's call it, 130, you'll recall last quarter, I mentioned that embedded in the midpoint of our guidance, it was for Regency to be about 115. And so we are well on track with respect to that line.
 In terms of enterprise and hyperscale rest of our ALM business is performing quite well. As I mentioned, on an organic basis, ALM was up 25%, which was stronger than we expected. And I should note that ALM in total was about $10 million ahead of the expectations we have baked into our first quarter guidance. So it was a meaningful portion of the upside for the total.
 In enterprise and hyperscale, getting directly to your question now, volume and price were both up and we saw component pricing rising through the quarter with more of the increase late in the quarter. So as we sit here today in April, component prices have continued to rise as compared to where they were in the first quarter.
 And in our outlook, we continue to be, I think, prudent with our expectations that, that is likely to continue to rise, although we haven't baked in the kind of some of the levels of increase that you've seen from some of the industry analysts, which are very robust increases as we move through the remainder of the year.
 Volume is being driven by our strong cross-selling activity and increased penetration with hyperscale clients as it relates to decommissioning. In both cases, we see that continuing to trend up over time. So we're feeling really good about the way ALM is starting to track with it. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. 
Jonathan Atkin: So a question on data centers and a question on, I guess, ALM. So on data centers for some of your newer expansions where you might end up doing build-to-suits or single tenant. What are the unlevered yields now that you are kind of underwriting to what would be kind of a minimum level that you think the market will bear? And then for ALM, I just wondered which regions do you think you could see outsized growth in? 
William Meaney: Okay. So maybe I'll start, John, and then Barry can give you some more color on ALM. On the data center side, I think we covered pretty much what we said in the last quarter, we see those trends continuing. So think of it as a couple of hundred basis points above the historical cash-on-cash return.
 So you're kind of looking at the 9 to 10 on hyperscale and then your -- I guess your question was more around hyperscale. So if you think about in terms of cost of capital, then we've -- basically, it's slightly ahead of what we've seen in the cost of capital with the run-up in interest rates. So the spreads are still positive in terms of the cost of finance, in terms of what we've gotten for cash-on-cash returns on the new leasing that we're doing.
 I mean that's due to the macro environment, as you know very well, in terms of -- it's a very, very strong market for data center, and we see that in our results. 
Barry Hytinen: Jon, it's Barry. On the ALM question as it relates to where we might see continued outsized performance, I don't want to come across promotional, but it's basically all regions because we are seeing ALM component pricing rise on a global basis, and we're seeing continued volume growth around the world, particularly in the U.S., thanks to our continued cross-selling to our some of our largest Fortune 1000 type clients as well as partnering together with the great team at Regency Technologies, we're seeing strong growth there.
 And I think that will continue for some time. As you know, the ALM market is very large, it's highly fragmented, and we think we have a huge opportunity in that space. And I just want to underscore that we're really, really pleased with the way the Regency combination is already unfolding even in this early stage of the integration. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. 
Alexander EM Hess: This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. Maybe 2 quick questions if you allow. On the ALM side, it appears that sort of -- if my math is right, that quarter-on-quarter, so 4Q '23 to 1Q '24 sort of the organic growth was about flat.
 Is that right? Maybe 25 million -- 25% growth times a year ago growth rate, a year ago revenue number for ALM? And then if I think about -- and maybe I'll let you answer that and then hopefully, you don't mind if I ask a maybe more longer-term-oriented question. 
Barry Hytinen: Go ahead with the longer term, and so we'll have them both. 
Alexander EM Hess: All right. Sounds good. So on the more longer-term-oriented question. I just wanted to know like how do you think about your ability to sort of deliver on time, on budget within your data center business and maybe how that's benchmarked against your peer group? 
William Meaney: Okay. Well, I'll deal with the longer term, and then I'll let Barry talk to you about the sequential quarter-over-quarter -- quarter-to-quarter on the ALM side. So on the -- I mean, the data center business, I think you can see that we're continuing to drive strong deployments across all of our campuses.
 So we don't see any change in terms of our ability to both plan and execute that, that's -- and you can see that in our leasing activity because as you can imagine, especially with the hyperscale clients and most of our leasing over the last 12 months has been -- the vast majority has been with hyperscale. You can imagine that's a key component for them to decide who they're going to go to, is our ability to actually execute on time, on budget, which is managing also the supply chain.
 So if anything, we see -- even though the demand is really, really strong right now in data center, we see that the planning has gotten a little bit simpler as supply chain is more normalized, albeit though this very, very strong demand. So we're blessed with a very good construction team. And our customers' trust is in a big part, exactly what you're talking about? 
Barry Hytinen: And Alex, it's Barry. Thanks for that question. You're doing the math right. It was up slightly on a dollar basis Q-to-Q. And I'll just note that as we said last quarter, on the decommissioning side, we had some clients last quarter that wanted to move some of their volume that they had been sitting on for some time. So there was a little bit of timing there.
 And frankly, I think we also saw in light of the way pricing was moving both from the end of the fourth quarter through the first quarter that some of our hyperscale clients were actually deferring some of the remarketing until later in the quarter in light of the fact that they wanted to like we did as well capture the better pricing that we've been seeing. As I mentioned earlier, the pricing really did ramp later in the quarter and continues.
 So the trends in that business are quite good. And what that results in is we had a little bit of mix in legacy IT renew business. I will note, however, that the enterprise business was up nicely on a sequential basis. And of course, in light of the cross-selling activity and the bookings that we've been talking about in that business and knowing that it's not the kind of remarketing. It's just a very straight service oriented.
 I am expecting the enterprise business to continue to grow quarter-to-quarter and, frankly, the hyperscale as well. So thanks for that, Alex. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. 
Eric Luebchow: Just to follow back on the data center business. Obviously, you have a high-class problem with most of your footprint pretty leased up. So how should we think about future data center CapEx given the strong leasing in the quarter? And how are you thinking about either additional markets or areas where you might need to add land capacity so that you have a further runway to grow the business beyond this year? 
William Meaney: Thanks, Eric, for the question. Yes. So I think let me kind of break out your question in 2 parts. From a capital standpoint, we're very much within our multiyear plan that we laid out at the Investor Day. So in terms of our ability to fund it, as I said, earlier is that we have a fully funded plan and that we don't see any issues between the strength that we have in our traditional records management business that generates as you know, tons of cash that we then -- after paying the dividend, we actually flow into data center and growth areas.
 And then, of course, the strong growth we're getting in EBITDA gives us plenty of debt capacity to continue to fund that growth. So in terms of the funding side of it, as you say, it's a high-class problem. But you can imagine even when we were putting the plans together and we do our budgets is we look at upside and downside in terms of demand. So we're pretty comfortable that we can continue to fund the growth that we're seeing.
 In terms of the footprint, you're right to point out that we're going to be full and for instance, in our Manassas campus fairly soon. And we've talked about that we're already starting construction on our third campus or our third data center in Phoenix. And we're building out the Madrid campus. We're adding to the Amsterdam campus London 3. We started off with 1 data center. Now we're in 3. We have 2 data centers in Frankfurt.
 So you're right to point that out. But I think you can imagine that we, right now, we feel very confident that we have in our pipeline to acquire more land that's in excess of the 100 megawatts for instance, that we guided this year. So we feel really good about the land bank strategy that we have in terms of what we have in the acquisition pipeline for land over the next -- for the rest of the year that will be ahead of our leasing activity. 
Barry Hytinen: Yes, Eric, I would just add on and thank you for the compliment, by the way, on how the data center business is continuing to progress. The team is doing a phenomenal job. But I would just add on that we have multiple land parcels that we are in active negotiations with. We were looking at multiple sites.
 And importantly, that is embedded in our capital spending that we've been planning, as Bill alluded to, to continue to add to the land bank kind of continuously year in and year out. So that's embedded in the capital. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC. 
Jonathan Atkin: Just a follow-up on, I guess, 2 follow-ups for your time. So you mentioned a lot of sovereign requirements, and I'm just interested in how competitive you find that space in terms of the RFP activity. And again, similar to my other question with earlier, is there particular region where you see more of those sorts of things, perhaps presenting opportunities? And then beyond the question would be the... 
Barry Hytinen: Jon, just before you go into the next question, we had a little interference with the signal. Can you repeat the first part of the question or maybe just give us the first question again? 
Jonathan Atkin: Yes. How competitive are you finding the sovereign requirements? I don't know if these are formal RFPs in each case, but if you can talk a little bit about the competitive environment and then future opportunities, are there particular regions where you see more growth ahead in kind of the public sector?
 And then the second question was more around ITAD and you mentioned the integration of Regency. How complex are those integrations? And is it too soon to think about doing more of those types of tuck-ins for ALM? 
William Meaney: Okay. Thanks, Jon. I'll take the question in terms of government contracting. And Barry, as you know, runs our M&A shopping. So I'll let him talk about both the integration with Regency as well as the pipeline in terms of further roll-ups.
 I think in terms of the sovereign contracting or government side of the business, is that we work for -- we work with a number. As you noticed that I highlighted a couple this time with United Kingdom, we do quite a bit in the United States, we also do quite a bit in other parts of Germany, including France and in -- yes, in other parts of France and Germany.
 And you're right, the relationships -- first of all, it's like anything else, it's a relationship building to make sure that you get into the queue. And you're right to point out that many times, these things lapse 12 months. In other words, they start talking to you before they get into the budgets and the budgets for the following year and you go through a tender process.
 But we feel pretty good about -- I mean, we've got teams that are very experienced at that. I think it's actually an opportunity for us because you can imagine we pick our places that we decide to play because you do have to have a 24-month horizon when you're going after that kind of business. So we typically go to the -- both the parts of government and the governments or states where we think that there's enough of a volume to do.
 So I think there's more for us to do and we're continuing to add to our teams in that area. And of course, you have to put very strong compliance around it, right? So -- but it is a strong part of our business, and it continues to grow. And it's a strong part -- and of all of our businesses. It's not just on the records management or the digital side, it includes data center. 
Barry Hytinen: Jon, it's Barry. Thanks for that question on the integration and tuck-ins. First thing I'd say is the integration is going very well. No integration, I would ever say, is easy because, of course, combinations of companies are -- it is complex. However, I think our team is doing a very, very good job, and I alluded to in the script, that we are ahead of plan, and we are seeing more benefits in terms of operational efficiencies, driving better margins, improved capabilities.
 And that's credit to the team we picked up at Regency Technologies because they have a best-in-class capability as it relates to processing and recycling. And Bill and I were recently in our largest facility in Ohio with the team of Regency Technologies. We saw a lot of great processing going on, a really dedicated team.
 I was in our Atlanta Regency facility last week, and saw the integration underway and we continue to see a lot of incremental capacity to utilize as we build out our ALM customer base. And as it relates to additional tuck-ins, I would say now that we've built the platform of both hyperscale, decommissioning as well as combining with Regency, tuck-ins are definitely something we are continuing to look at.
 It is to use your phrase, it is not too early to be considering them. We have a list. But of course, everything is fact and circumstances driven. We like to make sure we're getting things at a very appropriate multiple and that we can see clear growth aligned with our business and that it will be incremental to our franchise. And -- but I think that there are opportunities booked in the U.S. and throughout the world actually as we build out our ALM capability to be a global partner to our large client base. 
Operator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-22 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Gillian Tiltman: Thanks, Rocco. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor Language on Slide 2, and our annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William Meaney: Thank you, Gillian. And thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to report another outstanding year for Iron Mountain. We achieved record revenue and adjusted EBITDA in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Our record results are a testament to the devotion and hard work of our team and our resilient and growing business model. In the fourth quarter we achieved revenue of 1.4 -- $1.42 billion, yielding 8.7% total organic revenue growth and record adjusted EBITDA of $525 million up 11%. For the full year we delivered record results across the board, revenue of $5.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion, and AFFO of $1.2 billion. I'll now discuss some ways in which we have been working with our customers, which has led to this growth. Let's begin with our records management business. A win of note was with one of the largest health systems in the US awarding Iron Mountain a contract to significantly enhance its management of records across 140 hospitals and 2,600 care sites. Building on a strong long-term relationship with the customer, we are now implementing a rigorous compliance program that will reduce the cost and meet records retention requirements leading to a more efficient service. This win is particularly representative of our focus on cross-selling through Matterhorn as this customer is utilizing a variety of our products and services across our business lines, including digital services along with traditional records management and shredding. Another win showing Iron Mountain's cross-selling power occurred with a Hungarian industrial gas supplier. We are helping this customer to create space at its facilities by storing and then digitizing its records. We are also exploring opportunities to deploy our digital mailroom solution as our partnerships develop, thereby expanding this relationship across our product suite. The last win to highlight in our records management business is a new contract with the Swiss Division of a British multinational asset management company to relocate its physical records to one site and digitize them over time. In addition to freeing up physical space, our solution will ensure our customers' records are stored safely and compliantly, and enables more efficient access to the digitized information. Moving now to some wins in our digital solutions business, we won a contract from a large aerospace customer to deploy our InSight platform to manage and translate invoices from 22 languages into English. The customer chose our solution ahead of competing proposals, thanks to InSight's embedded AI engine, which gives it the ability to not only store, but to automatically classify a range of documents in a highly secure manner. Another win this quarter was with a Canadian government agency. This agency, which manages workplace compensation claims has been a customer of our records management services for more than 15 years. Our successful delivery of digital mailroom and imaging on demand solutions during the COVID pandemic has led to a new Master Services Agreement for digitizing services worth more than $10 million over the contract length. We will preserve, scan around 47,000 rolls of microfilm to produce 240 million images on our InSight platform, helping the agency to process compensation claims faster than ever and delivering a solid recurring revenue stream to drive our growth. In Brazil, a major television network that has been a records management customer for almost 25 years has asked us to manage the indexing and digitization of 50,000 boxes of records stored at its locations in Iron Mountain's facilities in the country. Our InSight platform is at the heart of our solution, enabling the customer to manage requests to digitize from all parts of the business in one place effectively and efficiently. Finally, the Hong Kong division of a major multinational bank has chosen Iron Mountain to be its partner in a major transformation of its finance operations. This customer manages a large volume of finance documents and has outsourced this work to Iron Mountain with a goal of streamlining the process of checking and scanning these files. We see the potential to scale the solution for the bank in other locations including Singapore, India, the US, United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates. Now let's turn to our data center business. We continue to be pleased with the growth trajectory of our data center business, which has only accelerated with the rapid adoption of AI-enabled services. We are pleased to have signed 124 megawatts well ahead of our initial plan for the year. We continue to see tremendous opportunity in serving both hyperscale and co-location customers and significant growth potential for our footprint. An example in the quarter, we signed a seven-year agreement to provide capacity at our New Jersey data center for an automated trading technology company that is expanding in the US. Our reputation for compliance and sustainability were key to winning this business and it was important for our customer to receive 100% traceable and verifiable energy and carbon records in support of its sustainability goals. Also in the U.S., we were pleased to win a data center deal with a secure cloud storage company that is growing rapidly across North America. Our reliability and close relationships since first doing business with this customer a year ago helped to seal this new deal as did the strategic location of our facility in Northern Virginia. Moving to India, we continue to see strong demand for capacity. We closed a data center contract with a major bank in the country in the fourth quarter. This customer chose our Mumbai facility specifically and Iron Mountain more broadly for our ability to provide a secure data center for its large domestic branch platform close to its headquarters. Turning to our Asset Lifecycle Management business, or ALM, we secured a significant contract with a global financial services company. Our ability to integrate our secure ALM services with the customer’s existing business management platform was critical and has enabled them to streamline how they order, complete and report on their IT asset disposition activities. Our solution was an excellent demonstration of how deeply we understand the needs of our customers, especially in the highly regulated world of financial services. Staying with ALM business, in the quarter we won a contract with a U.S. vehicle insurance company that has been an existing customer of ours for many years. Having shifted its employees to a remote working model, our customer needed to partner with the capacity to retrieve over 37,000 devices from more than 240 locations nationwide, then process, refurbish, and return them for distribution. Our solution provides our customer with better visibility of its IT assets and enables them to manage this activity more efficiently. I should also highlight the synergy between our ALM and data center business when it comes to data center renewal and decommissioning. We are now in a position to not only provide co-location and cloud migration services, but we can also securely and responsibly dispose of obsolete IT equipment. An example of such an opportunity in this quarter was a major win with one of the world's leading producers of business process management software. We managed the secure decommissioning of over 40 data centers globally, sanitized the IT assets and remarketed them to deliver a significant return in value. Also in the quarter, we were awarded a contract by one of the oldest financial institutions in the US for a similar data center decommissioning project. Both wins demonstrate that Iron Mountain is uniquely positioned to minimize risk and maximize savings as a single source partner for these activities. Finally, let me take a moment to highlight our acquisition of Regency Technologies. Regency's team makes a great addition to the leadership of our rapidly growing ALM business and gives us additional capabilities to serve this fast growing sector at the heart of the circular economy. Furthermore, this acquisition together with the momentum we have been building in ALM through the strengthening of component pricing and cross selling sets us up well for continued success. To conclude, I would like to thank our team for their resilience, hard work and dedication as we continue our Matterhorn clime and continue to serve over 225,000 customers. We are thrilled to progress ahead of expectations and it is due to the commitment of our Mountaineers. As we look to 2024 and beyond, the momentum we have built will continue to drive the opportunities ahead with another year of double digit top line growth expected. Barry will speak in detail about our financial guidance for the year ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill. And thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and our outlook for 2024. Turning to our financials, in the fourth quarter our team continued the trend of delivering record performance on all of our key financial metrics. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.42 billion grew 11% year-on-year or 10% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a new quarterly record. On an organic basis, total organic revenue grew 8.7%. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 10.4% as a result of strong performance in both our records management and our data center businesses. Total service revenue increased 8% to $549 million. This was driven by Global RIM at 10% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic basis. Project Matterhorn's focus on selling our entire range of products and services has driven these strong results and are a testament to our commercial team's efforts. Adjusted EBITDA was $525 million, a new record, up 11% on a reported basis and 10% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected at 37% and improved 100 basis points sequentially, driven by strong mix and cost productivity across all of our businesses. As we've stated in our earnings press release, effective in the fourth quarter of 2023, our AFFO definition has been updated to exclude amortization of capitalized commissions. In light of the growth of our data center business, we conducted a benchmarking analysis of other companies in the industry and as such, have aligned our AFFO reporting accordingly, which provides investors better insight into the funds available to support the growth of our business. AFFO was $328 million or $1.11 on a per share basis, up $29 million and $0.09 respectively from the fourth quarter of last year. To allow for comparison to our guidance and consensus, we are reporting our prior methodology as well. On our previous calculation, AFFO was $317 million or $1.07 on a per share basis. This was $7 million better than our AFFO guidance and $0.02 better than our guidance on a per share basis. Now, let me briefly summarize the full year. Revenue of $5.5 billion increased 7% on a reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 7% year-on-year to $1.96 billion, an increase of $135 million. AFFO increased over 5% to $1.2 billion or $4.12 on a per share basis. On our previous calculation, AFFO was $1.168 billion or $3.97 on a per share basis. And now turning to segment performance for the quarter. Our global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.19 billion, an increase of $108 million from last year or 10% on a reported basis. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 8.5%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $534 million, an increase of $48 million year-on-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin was 44.7%, up 100 basis points sequentially, driven by strong services mix and productivity. Our data center business continues to grow and deliver strong performance. From a total revenue perspective, we delivered 32% year-on-year growth on a reported basis and 30% year-on-year growth on a constant currency basis. Our data center storage revenue grew 34% year-on-year or 32% on a constant currency basis, driven by new development coming online. Data center EBITDA was up approximately $10 million year-on-year and EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points sequentially. Moreover, pricing trends have continued to be strong and we have seen returns expanding 100 basis points to 150 basis points in advance of higher interest rates. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we completed 4 megawatts in the Q4. For the full year, we leased 124 megawatts, exceeding the projection we provided on our last call. Nearly 100% of those leases resulted from cross selling, which you know is a key initiative in our Project Matterhorn plan. Our pipeline is at record levels. We are expanding our relationships with key hyperscale clients and our team is executing well. So we are pleased to project new and expansion leasing of 100 megawatts for 2024. Incidentally, that represents a 25% increase from our initial 2023 projection at this time last year. Turning to our Asset Lifecycle Management business. In the fourth quarter, we delivered improved performance for both revenue and EBITDA, achieving the expectations we set on our last call. Our team drove strong operating productivity and we saw component pricing beginning to trend up modestly on a sequential basis. Similar to data center, cross selling activity has been particularly strong in our ALM business with nearly all deals coming in as a result of it. We completed our acquisition of Regency Technologies early in January. This acquisition strengthens our ability to serve an expanding ALM customer base and broadens our capability in the category, especially in the enterprise segment. Regency brings robust remarketing and recycling capabilities to better serve our customers and help them achieve their environmental and data security goals. We have long admired the leadership at Regency and are thrilled to welcome their entire organization to our team. Turning to capital, for the full year 2023, we invested $1.2 billion of growth $140 million of recurring, consistent with the expectation we shared on our last call. For 2024, we are planning for capital expenditure to be approximately $1.35 billion of growth and approaching $150 billion of recurring. Given our strong pre lease activity, the vast majority of our growth capital will be dedicated to data center development. Turning to the balance sheet, with strong adjusted EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times and our leverage remains at its lowest level in a decade. For 2024, we expect to exit the year at similar levels to year end 2023. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share to be paid in early April. And on a trailing four quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 62%, in line with our long term target range of low to mid-60s percent. Now, let me provide an update on our progress as to the Project Matterhorn growth objectives we shared at our Investor Day in September of 2022. You will recall that we introduced [tighter] (ph) targets for growth between the period of 2021 through 2026 of approximately 10% for revenue, approximately 10% for adjusted EBITDA and approximately 8% for AFFO. Two years into our Matterhorn journey, we are well on track, even ahead of those commitments, having achieved 13% annual revenue growth from 2021 to the end of 2023 on a constant currency basis. We have achieved 11% annual adjusted EBITDA growth and in excess of 10% annual AFFO growth. The dollar has been particularly strong over this period and despite this, we have been delivering on our commitments on a reported basis as well. Now let me share our projections for the full year 2024. We expect total revenue to be within the range of $6 billion to $6.15 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 11% at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within the range of $2.175 billion to $2.225 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 12% at the midpoint. We expect AFFO to be within the range of $1.3 billion to $1.335 billion, which represents year-on-year growth of 9% at the midpoint. And we expect AFFO per share for the full year to be $4.39 to $4.51 and this represents year-on-year growth of 8% at the midpoint. In terms of foreign exchange, we are using a forecast based on those of several major financial institutions. Compared to 2023, this results in a full year FX headwind of $25 million to revenue and approximately $10 billion to EBITDA and AFFO. Turning to the first quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.45 billion, adjusted EBITDA in excess of $510 billion and AFFO of approximately $310 billion and AFFO per share of approximately $1.05. To conclude, we are pleased to have delivered a strong year in 2023. I am confident that we will build on our momentum and continue to drive strong growth in 2024. We are well on track to achieve our Project Matterhorn goals. I'd like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to our entire team for delivering a successful year and their continued dedication to serving our clients. And with that, operator, will you please open the line for Q&A?
Operator: Absolutely. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. In the ALM business, you mentioned component prices trended up quarter-over-quarter. Can you elaborate on how ALM volumes and component prices performed on a year-over-year basis in the quarter? And what assumptions for component prices you're factoring into your 2024 guidance?
William Meaney: Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. So let me kind of answer the kind of the higher level on the strategic where we see the trends going and then Barry can go to the next level and give you a little bit more specifics in terms of the numbers. But on the -- to your macro point in terms of the trends on the component prices, it's very much in line what you see in terms of the analyst reports right now and you can see that coming through in the Q4 and building into Q1. So we expect the component prices to continue to strengthen during the course of the year. And you can see that broadly in the semiconductor and memory business for the original manufacturers as well. So we're very much benefiting from the same trends you're seeing in the industry for the OEMs, as well as for the reused or the recycled market. In terms of volume, actually throughout the year as we've been reporting on the last few quarters is we continue to see increase in volume, although when that turned into revenue, it was muted because of the low component prices that we started off the year and kind of worked through the rest of the year. But the trends that we saw in Q4 -- that showed up in Q4 continue -- we continue to see building in Q1 and we're very much tracking what you're seeing in the broader OEM market for memory, disks and CPUs, GPUs. Barry?
Barry Hytinen: Yes. Hey, George. Good morning. Thank you for that question. I'll give you a little bit more detail on how we're thinking about ALM in total. So in 2023, in light of those trends that Bill was mentioning, we delivered $177 million revenue from ALM. Now for our guidance at the midpoint, we're assuming about $355 million of total revenue for ALM. I'll note that Regency brings in $115 million right there. So it's sort of $240 million against the $177 million. I think if you look at what we did in the fourth quarter, what you'll find is just at the fourth quarter run rate, we'd be in excess of $200 million, $205 million, $206 million and that's assuming no improvement from all the enterprise bookings we've been doing over the last half as Bill was referring to, as well as and what will likely be a continued improving environment on component pricing. So whereas last year, we were faced with really significant challenges of component pricing continuing to decline earlier in the year and then staying at those trough levels, we have assumed a modest amount of pricing benefit on component pricing as we move through the year. Really, we didn't assume much of any change from the fourth quarter to the first quarter that may prove conservative. And then we assumed a fairly slow ramp, slower than what all the industry prognostications are for component pricing. So when I look at the incremental increase we have in the guidance for our organic ALM business, George, it's about $35 million, which -- we'll see how the year goes, but I feel very good about where we're positioned. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much. Could you talk a little bit about the pricing environment and how that contributed to revenue growth in the quarter and how much you're expecting that to be a contribution to guidance in 2024? We're seeing kind of an uptake in some of the RIM organic revenue growth and I was wondering how much of that might be directly pricing versus anything else?
Barry Hytinen: Hi, Shlomo, this is Barry. Thank you for that question. So what you would see in our results and as you're pointing to and thank you for that is that, our global RIM storage rental revenue was up 8% -- over 8% in the quarter on an organic basis and for the full year it was about 8.5%. So we have very strong storage rental revenue growth in 2023 and that's with positive volume trends and good mix and revenue management. And the way we think about revenue management of course as we talked about before is about value. Our ability to provide our customers with value added services, such as our ability to provide digitization on demand rapidly whenever they need it, Smart Sort and a host of other value added services. So -- and then incidentally, our service revenue also stepped up nicely in the Q4 on Global RIM as well. And so, our expectation for the new year embedded in the guidance, Shlomo, is about -- round numbers, call it 6-ish percent growth for Global RIM at the midpoint, which in light of the revenue management actions we have as a anniversary from last year as well as additional revenue management actions this year, very good trajectory we think on services, inclusive of digital services continue to ramp through the year. We feel very good about that projection and I think it does imply an opportunity for us to certainly achieve the midpoint on the Global RIM number at 6%. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP. Please go ahead.
Nate Crossett: Hey, good morning. Maybe one related to that previous question is, I know you don't give a formal guide, but what are you expecting in terms of overall RIM volumes for Q1 and the remainder of this year? And then if I could just ask one on data center pricing and leasing. How much of that 100 megawatt guide is kind of already in the pipeline? And I think cash mark to market was 5% for 2023. How do you see that playing out this year? Thank you.
William Meaney: So Nate, I'll take the pipeline question on the data center and then Barry -- I'll let Barry take your question on the pricing. So on the pipeline as you would expect, especially with the hyperscale, you know the market extremely well is that, we have a very strong pipeline going into the year. So yes, when we set our targets, yes, I mean, you can assume that we have a pretty big pipeline that stands behind that. And if you look at the way we set our targets, it's very consistent with what we laid out on Investor Day. It's where -- you think about couple of years ago, we were in the 60s. So you see that our targets are continuing to show that we are growing the business north of 20% a year. And obviously some of these big contracts can either put you well ahead or at the targets that we set. But we're very comfortable that we're continuing to build momentum in the business and we're maintaining these 20% plus growth rates on a very quickly or very rapidly growing base. So I think you can assume that like anything else is that, we have a pretty good pipeline. In fact, across most of our businesses, we maintain a pretty strong pipeline behind our targets.
Barry Hytinen: Nate, thanks for the question. It's Barry. A couple of responses on the physical volume, much as we have forecasted the last few years, we're planning this year the same way, which is for our physical volume to be slightly up for the year and also for the Q1 [indiscernible] about that. And so, the vast majority of the growth that I mentioned for Global RIM will be driven off of services as well as revenue management of course. As it relates to your question about mark to market on data center, clearly trends have been good with respect to mark to market over the last really five, six quarters. And from what we're seeing, we continue to expect that to be trending upward, and we have high visibility on that. And frankly, in the co-lo space, it's trending up even higher. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe on Matterhorn, you highlighted some recent wins there, but I'd imagine it's a very long sales cycle for a lot of the engagements that you have. Maybe you could talk a little bit about where you see yourselves in the overall process with individual customers and, how much additional benefit you expect to see stemming from the Matterhorn initiatives over the next four to five years?
William Meaney: Thanks, Brendon. You're right. I mean they're typically longer than our traditional sales cycles. If you think about the services that we were selling five, six years ago when our service revenue was down in the 40s, right, and so obviously 10 times that today just on digital and when I'm talking about digital services now that portion of the service business. Now it's more than 10 times that size. It is definitely because it's much more of a solution orientation. That being said, so we maintain much bigger pipelines to back up that growth. But as you can see, we're continuing to grow that business in double digit territory. So the -- but the -- on the other side, the flip side is more and more of these services are recurring or multiyear projects. So has that built even though the sales cycle is longer, is the -- also the revenue that comes in is around longer, if you will. So it's -- if we look at it right now, it's approaching 30%, 40% of the revenue that were coming in is truly recurring and/or very long multiyear projects. So at one level, yes, it's a longer sales cycle. Another level, it allows us to continue to build momentum and drive growth in that business because each year we're replacing less than we were before.
Barry Hytinen: The only thing I'd add, Brendan, it's Barry, is that, our cross selling opportunity is very large at this business, right? We have well over 200,000 clients, most of them are measured in decades of duration and we are seeing our cross selling efforts continue to expand. We increased significantly year-on-year, but there's a lot more opportunity. And when I think about the services that Bill just mentioned as well as things like Asset Lifecycle Management, really those are services that we can be offering and nearly all of our customers need. And so we think it -- Matterhorn, we are -- as you heard me say, we reiterated our targets today and we're in fact running ahead. So we feel very good about where we're at.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Hey, it looks like the total volumes increased in time to the storage, but the retention slipped a little bit. What drove that kind of acceleration there, because it looks like a nice outcome?
William Meaney: Yes. So Kevin, I would say, if you look at our retention rates over the last 15 or so years, you would see, because that data is available, that it's very much in line and it can wobble few basis points here or there quarter-to-quarter. But we are very pleased with our retention and our customer satisfaction scores. And thank you for the point, volume has been quite good and that speaks to our commercial team's ability to continue to win new business. And, frankly, if you look at the storage revenue growth that the team is putting up, it's I think quite impressive, including the acceleration. So thank you for the question.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Great. Thank you. I just wanted to touch on data centers and capital allocation. So, you talked about pricing continuing to ramp in the data center ecosystem and we've seen demand outstripping supply. So maybe you could touch on where your targeted development yields are for the $1.3 billion of CapEx, the majority of which is data centers. And if you [indiscernible] opportunities to accelerate that 100 megawatts of leasing even further, maybe touch on some other funding sources like joint ventures, that could maybe give you additional capital to attack the hyperscale opportunity? Thank you.
William Meaney: Thanks Eric for the question. So in terms of the returns that we're getting and Barry touched upon in his script is, you should think about interest rates or the cost of capital have moved up, but our pricing has moved up about 100 basis points, 150 basis points ahead of that. So we're actually getting higher returns, even in a higher interest rate environment than we were before. So the pricing has moved up quite nicely, even more if you look at the non-hyperscale portion, but I'm talking more about the hyperscale customers in and of themselves. And that's partly driven by the traction we're getting in the market. And then the other part of it is the scarcity. I mean, especially with the growth in AI, as you know, AI actually absorbs a lot of power and that's what we're selling effectively is capacity or access to power. So I think we're really happy with the way that the pricing is evolving in the business. In terms of your other question, in other words, yes, and it kind of goes to the pipeline. Yes, we feel very comfortable about the target for this year, which is more than 20% ahead, close to 25% ahead than what we targeted last year. So the continued momentum and growth in the business and the -- could we do more than that? Yes. We have a fully funded plan, so we don't see any shortage of capital. And remember, the one of the advantages that we have, not just because of the cross selling of Matterhorn that having the full information services suite. But the other part of it is that, our records management business is a 70% plus gross margin business that generates a lot of cash and that gives us deeper pockets than some of the pure play data center places -- players in terms of being able to both deliver our dividend and -- growth and dividend to our shareholders as well as putting capital to work in data center as I said. And it just so happens that 225,000 plus customer base is a cross selling opportunity for us.
Barry Hytinen: Eric, the only thing I guess I would add there is that, just building on Bill's point there is, in terms of the growth in the EBITDA that we're generating, and so over $230 million at the midpoint nearly $240 million with our leverage target range, we have a lot of capacity and that together with the cash flow of the business puts us in a position where we can issue the strong guidance that we did, invest heavily in our data center development and, of course, that's the nature of having prelease so much of our business. If you look at the amount of construction we have underway versus the prelease, it's very high, think high 95% or so. And so we'll continue to ramp our development in data center to keep up with the contracts that we've signed and all the while maintaining our leverage year-on-year at the same level. So we feel very good about where we're at. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. I'm just interested in Regency, any kind of early learnings now that you're a little bit into having acquired it, thoughts about how to achieve top line synergies and other growth paths that you could see in that segment more generally?
William Meaney: Thanks Jon for the question. As I said in my script and also Barry is that, we're really excited about the Regency acquisition, not just because of the footprint that it gives us, it gives us stronger even scale within the United States, but also the leadership team. So very strong leaders that we're really happy to kind of continue to build out the organizational structure under Mark Kidd. So we're -- so first of all, the leaders that we got with that business, we're very excited about. The second thing is they have a lot of customers that both overlap, but they also have a lot of customers that don't. So for instance, they have a very good both federal and local government portfolio businesses and that's a business that we're already in deep collaboration in terms of how we can expand that using Iron Mountain's muscle with our 26,000 Mountaineers around the globe on how they can actually tap into that. And then they also have some expertise, especially around the end user devices, which already we're doing a lot in end user devices that highlighted some of the wins on my -- in my opening remarks. But the -- they have even further capabilities, which I think is going to give us a lot more to do on the back end in terms of the way we serve customers and the efficiency that we could process their equipment.
Barry Hytinen: Yes. Jon, the only thing I guess I would add is that, when we knew this as part of the deal, but just to underscore it, there's considerable capacity for processing at Regency. And as Bill mentioned, they add to our capabilities, they have got eight facilities around the U.S, which really broadens our reach and ability to serve clients quickly. And this is a team there that has been building a business very profitably, I might add, for decades. And so they -- to underscore Bill's point, they really know what they're doing, and I think the combination is an excellent one. So thanks for that question.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. If you don't mind, I'm going to get a little more into the weeds. Barry, just on -- we saw some interesting gross margin changes like just on a sequential basis. We saw the services margin go up from 260 basis points. It seems like the costs were contained while the revenue increased. But on the storage side, you have all other storage costs going up by $11.5 million, pushed the gross margin down by about 80 basis points sequentially. I know these things move around quarter-to-quarter, but maybe you can give us a little bit of insight as to what's in that all other storage costs that moved up $11.5 million this quarter.
Barry Hytinen: Yes, sure thing, Shlomo. I'll take the services point first. As I alluded to in the prepared remarks, we had very good mix within our services. And as you know, when we're doing services especially as we're continuing to see larger and larger deals, the mix of those can move around and the timing of them. And so we had anticipated a little lower margin mix in the services portfolio. Some of those deals pushed into the first quarter here in terms of when we win them and into the New Year. But we then won some deals and we're able to provide service on some higher margins. So that's part of it. And together with the fact that candidly our team here does a great job driving productivity across our services organization. As it relates to the storage gross margin, I'm glad you asked that question, because there's an item that I want to make sure we all understand. That storage gross margin, of course, is the combination of all of our storage businesses. So when you think about the Records Management Physical Storage Business, that's a very high gross margin business and continued to perform very well. We're very pleased with the margins in that business in light of revenue management, et cetera and the volume trends over the last several years. It's been trending really well. The factor that can affect the actual rate though and also affects your all other storage costs, which I'll come to, is data center. As you know, as you'd see from our peer companies that are public as well as some of the other companies in the data center space, the gross margins on data center generally as an industry are lower than our records management business. And so while our data center gross margin actually expanded both sequentially and year-on-year, the mix in fact because data center grew, I think the storage revenue was up 35% or so year-on-year in the quarter that has a mix element. And so, you can have a situation where our gross margins are improving on both businesses, yet the contribution creates the rate going down slightly. As it relates to all other storage costs, that's -- one of the big drivers there, of course, is and it goes to data center is the power. And so, as we're having more and more client commencements, they start drawing more power in there that also has an effect on gross margin, but doesn't change our EBITDA dollars. So good questions and I hope that clears that up. We feel very, very good about the gross margins in the company.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. A quick follow-up. It looks like your dividend payout ratio has dipped below the 65% LTM target, which is where you raised the dividend earlier. Can you talk about your thoughts on raising the dividend again now that the payout ratio is below the threshold?
William Meaney: Yes. No, thanks George. And you're right. We're maintaining as a Board and as a company that our target payout ratio is kind of in the low 60s, 60% to 65% and we are kind of trending [indiscernible] we are in that range now. So this is, obviously, a decision for the Board, but I think you could expect the way we're trending in the guidance we've given you for the year, it's a natural forcing function that the board will be considering and. I think it's -- as you can just kind of see the mathematics of it, it looks like we're running into another increase in the near future and not too distant future, I should say.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Gillian Tiltman: Thank you, Andrea. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 of our presentation and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, and we've included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking the time to join us today to discuss another record quarterly results. Once again, our Mountaineers have gone above and beyond in their efforts to serve our customers with innovative solutions that support their businesses, putting our customers first runs deep in all we do and sits at the core of Iron Mountain. This legacy, combined with our dedication to not only protect but to elevate the power of our customers' assets and work continues to drive our execution and growth. Turning to our results. We delivered record third quarter performance once again achieving our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.4 billion which to put that in context, is an increase of over $100 million year-over-year and record EBITDA of $500 million. The strength in these results is a direct result of the positive momentum we are building from Project Matterhorn. We are more than a year into our growth journey and are pleased with our enhanced operating model, which is empowering our commercial organization to cross-sell our products and services. In the third quarter, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 10% as a result of continued revenue management success and improved volume trends and drove over 20% organic growth in our data center business. Let's begin by turning to some of our customer wins, which played a significant role in our ability to achieve these record results. In our records management business, we had a public sector win this quarter in the U.K. with a new contract worth nearly $2 million. This new project is with an important government agency and has been an Iron Mountain customer for 18 years. In that time, our relationship has expanded from an off-site records management provider to an integral partner at our customers highly secure site, which indicates the trust and confidence our customers have in us. By relocating and digitizing important records securely, our customer can make faster and more informed decisions that are critical due to the sensitive nature of its work, whilst also freeing up on-site space. As a public sector organization, the value for each dollar they spend is a key concern for this customer, and we continue to demonstrate that Iron Mountain is the partner of choice for their digital transformation journey. In Digital Solutions, this business continues to gain momentum, especially with our ability to provide higher value, technology-enabled solutions to new and existing Iron Mountain customers. Customer wins for our digital solutions are underpinned by three key differentiators. First, our unique ability to provide a unified end-to-end solution for our customers across their physical and digital assets. Second, our proven capabilities to operate at scale in complex regulated environments and industries. Last, but importantly, our ability to drive business outcomes for our customers, leveraging our artificial intelligence platform, which translates unstructured data into actionable insights. For example, we have been awarded a contract by the TV and film production distribution division of a major technology company, with a story history dating back almost 100 years, we are leveraging our InSight platform to digitize, archive and preserve over 200,000 legal records containing the media rights for distribution and licensing of thousands of film in titles and TV episodes. With all this data available through one cloud-based digital platform, we can help our customers identify and develop new business opportunities by leveraging its rich intellectual property. This latest deal builds on a growing portfolio of solutions we are providing for this global customers' different business units, including records management and IT asset disposition. The multifaceted long-standing relationship we have with this customer truly highlights the success of Project Matterhorn and our cross-selling efforts. Now let's turn to our continued success in winning government business around the world. We are supporting government agencies in Europe to digitize public services as part of an initiative to make their economies and societies more sustainable and resilient following the COVID-19 pandemic. This quarter, we won a two-year deal to digitize around 10 million files to accelerate a backlog of pension payments for one national government Social Security Administration agency. In awarding Iron Mountain this contract, the customer recognized the specialist nature of our solution, including our AI and human in the loop capabilities and our ability to quickly scale operationally to deliver this project within the required time frame. Also in the public sector, we are pleased to be working with the U.S. citizen and Immigration Services to help drive efficiency and reduce the backlog of applicants awaiting adjudication decisions to become U.S. citizens. Over the last 10 years, we have been a proud partner with this important government agency. Having been entrusted with over 500,000 cubic feet of files in high-density tapes, our digitization solutions will enable remote adjudicators to have faster access to vital data, helping them make overall immigration decisions. Turning to our asset life cycle management business. Consistent with the projections we shared last quarter, pricing has been stable, having hit a low level last February. Whilst industry projections are for significant price improvements in late 2023 and throughout 2024, we have continued to take a prudent perspective and are only assuming marginal incremental pricing improvement for the remainder of the year. Our pipeline is robust, and we have delivered solid results this quarter that were in line with our expectations. Also, we are excited to share that we have signed an agreement to acquire Regency Technologies subject to customary closing conditions as we continue our roll-up of the ALM market. Regency is a little over $100 million annual revenue business in the ALM space based in Ohio. The long-term customer relationships that Regency brings to Iron Mountain are an excellent strategic fit to our ALM business. Regency will add operational scale as we continue our growth journey in this fast-growing sector. As the world's need for both secure and more circular solutions for end-of-life IT assets becomes more vital, we are pleased to add to our capability in this category. With that, let us turn our discussion to some individual wins within the ALM space this quarter. I am pleased to share a particularly exciting win for our ALM business with a large global technology company. The deep relationship and trust we have built with this customer over many years was instrumental in Iron Mountain securing the significant deal serving multiple business lines and geographies for the customer. These geographies include India, where our presence and ability to service the customer was a decisive differentiator alongside our global footprint, the expertise and responsiveness of our ALM team and our reputation for data security and chain of custody. Also in ALM, we have signed a long-term contract with a private U.S. insurance company that has been a long-time customer of our U.S. Secure Shredding and Destruction services. Last year, we began supporting this customer with one-off IT asset destruction projects, which demonstrated the value of remarketing thousands of these assets. The agreement we have now reached positions us as our customers strategic partner for its future end-to-end IT asset management needs. By supporting the requirements of an organization with over 37,000 leased IT assets that need returning from remote employees, we are extending the value of the solutions we bring and have changed our customers' perception of what Iron Mountain can offer. Finally, we have a particularly exciting win to share. We have secured a significant five-year ALM contract to support a leading pharmaceutical retailer in the U.S. to advance its commitment to zero waste by 2030. Iron Mountain will provide a circular economy solution by removing and recycling thousands of tons of pharmaceutical stock bottles and pill bottles from thousands of its retail outlets across the U.S. We are providing this leading retailer with an advanced recycling solution turning plastic into raw materials. This will enable the creation of new virgin plastic, helping this retailer meet their environmental goals. This is made possible by the scale of our physical presence, our highly experienced ALM team and a reporting platform for all of the confidential weights that we have managed for this customer since 2014. We are pleased to be able to extend the value of our partnership with this new contract. Moving on to our data center business. Our pipeline continues to expand with positive pricing trends. The continuing strong demand for data center capacity, continues to be driven by digital transformation and most recently, the explosive demand for AI. Supporting the growth and expansion needs of our customers is paramount to our collaborative partnerships, and we are pleased to provide this required capacity to our customers in the markets in which they are keen to operate. From a leasing perspective, in the third quarter, we signed 65 megawatts. This means that through the end of the third quarter, we have already signed 120 megawatts far beyond our original projection, for the year of 80 megawatts. In the quarter, 60 megawatts were signed across two leases to a single Fortune 500 technology company at our campus in Northern Virginia. The deal provides this hyperscale customer with capacity across two buildings on our 142-acre, 276-megawatt campus and represents, the largest revenue deal in Iron Mountain data center's history. We have also won a deal to provide nearly three megawatts of capacity at our Frankfurt data center for an existing North American cloud services customer looking to expand their European footprint. Our sales teams work closely with the customers' technical team to agree on a strategic solution that meets the customers' unique infrastructure needs. Given the strong customer demand in our data center business, we are continuing to expand the reach of our platform. To that end, I am pleased to announce a couple of capacity additions. First, we are repurposing a previous records management facility in Miami to data center use. Miami is a key market, where a number of our customers, are looking for edge deployments and this newly repurposed facility will add 16 megawatts to our data center portfolio. Furthermore, we have acquired additional land and power this quarter, growing our total data center capacity to 860 megawatts, up 80 megawatts from last quarter. In summary, the hard work dedication and execution of our Mountaineers continues to deliver strong results for our loyal customers and ultimately, our company shareholders. Through our Matterhorn initiative fueled by our enhanced operating model, our team continues to achieve record sales growth by selling our entire mountain range of products and services to our long-standing 225,000 customers. Even in a tumultuous geopolitical climate, the resilience and strength of our business model, combined with the dedication and customer-first passion of our mountaineers continues to drive us ever higher. I would also like to express my deepest gratitude to our team for their hard work and continued focus as we continue our growth journey. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results today. In the third quarter, our team achieved strong performance across all metrics, including another record for revenue and EBITDA. Revenue grew to $1.4 billion, up 8% year-on-year on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis, in line with our projection. Our key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage rental revenue, which grew 10%. This reflects continued strong contributions from revenue management, data center commencements and positive volume trends. Total service revenue was $530 million, consistent year-over-year on a constant currency basis and slightly improved on a sequential basis. As we discussed last quarter, service revenue includes the impact of component price declines versus the prior year. Excluding our ALM business, total company constant currency revenue growth would have been 9%. Our team delivered a new record for adjusted EBITDA at $500 million, up 7% year-on-year. This was modestly ahead of our guidance for the quarter despite the U.S. dollar strengthening significantly. On the same foreign exchange rates we used in August, we would have achieved $504 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter ahead of our projection. EBITDA growth was driven by continued strength in revenue management and strong data center commencements. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36%, up 100 basis points sequentially and ahead of our projections by 50 basis points. Upside was driven by productivity across our operations, including improving trends in our ALM business. AFFO was $290 million or $0.99 on a per share basis, up $2 million and $0.01 on a per share basis from the third quarter of last year. Both of these were in line with the projections we shared on our last call. On the same foreign exchange rates, we were using in August, AFFO would have been $294 million, or $1 on a per share basis, both ahead of our projections. And now turning to segment performance. In the third quarter, our global RIM business achieved revenue of $1.18 billion, an increase of $92 million year-on-year or 8%. Revenue management and positive volume trends, contribute to strong organic storage rental revenue growth of 8%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA, was $517 million, an increase of $33 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business. The team delivered revenue of $128 million, an increase of over $27 million year-on-year. Organic storage rental revenue growth was strong at 22%, driven by commencements and improved pricing. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $53 million, up over $10 million or 25% year-on-year. Turning to new and expansion leasing. We signed 65 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 120 megawatts. As Bill mentioned, we signed two leases with a client for a total of 60 megawatts. The leases are expected to commence in phases from late 2024 through mid-2025 and have a 15-year term. With the strength of our leasing, I'll note that our weighted average lease expiration is now 8.1 years, which is up a full three years from the third quarter of 2022. As we've talked about before, one of the key elements of our Matterhorn growth plan is to expand cross-selling. Our team is doing a great job in this regard. For example, 95% of the megawatts booked in the quarter, were a result of cross-selling activity. Market-to-market was up over 11% in the quarter, reflecting the continuing trend of strong and improving pricing, while churn was only 1%. Turning to asset life cycle management. In the third quarter, revenue was consistent on a sequential basis, in line with the projections we gave on our last call. We are seeing positive momentum across all three verticals of our ALM business, hyperscale, enterprise and OEM. ALM bookings have been running ahead of our projections.  And similar to data center, our commercial teams are doing a great job with our cross-selling initiative. For example, of the new ALM deals we signed in the quarter, nearly all of them were cross-sell wins. I think this is an early validation of our strategy and supports our long-term view that we can gain considerable market share by leveraging our deep customer relationships and expanding ALM capabilities. Now, I would like to spend a moment addressing component pricing. As expected, pricing was consistent with the second quarter on a sequential basis. At this point, in the fourth quarter, there are indications that component pricing is beginning to recover. For example, since the end of the third quarter, we have seen the pricing for memory rising week over week with it now up nearly 15% on a sequential basis. As we've mentioned on our last call, industry analysts have been forecasting rising prices by late this year, with continued recovery in 2024. Turning to our pending acquisition of Regency Technologies. As Bill mentioned, we are very pleased to have signed this deal. We've known Regency for years and have always been impressed with the strength of their team, range of capabilities and focus on sustainability, productivity and customer service. We see this acquisition as an excellent strategic fit furthering our ability to serve our expanding ALM customer base. The purchase price is $200 million with $125 million to be paid at close and the remainder due in 2025. Subject to performance, there is also an earn-out, which could be payable in 2027. On a trailing four-quarter basis, Regency has revenue in excess of $100 million. We are acquiring the business at an approximate 7.5 times EBITDA multiple. We expect the deal to close late this year or early in 2024. We expect this will be immediately accretive to AFFO and have no impact on our leverage calculation. Turning to capital. In the third quarter, we invested $322 million, of which $287 million was growth and $35 million was recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times. We expect to exit 2023 at this level. I think it is worth noting that this marks our lowest leverage level in a decade. Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share, to be paid in early January. We remain dedicated to our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we are funding our growth objectives while continuing to drive meaningful shareholder returns. And now turning to our projections. For the full year, reflecting our year-to-date performance and strong outlook, we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.44 billion, which represents 12.5% growth year-over-year as revenue management actions and improving trends in ALM accelerate our growth. I would like to call out using the same foreign exchange rates we had in August, fourth quarter revenue would have been $25 million higher in this projection. Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $520 million or 10% growth. AFFO of approximately $310 million, which is 8% growth and AFFO per share of approximately $1.05, which is 7% growth from the prior year. With the same FX rates we were using in August, this projection would be approximately adjusted EBITDA of $528 million, AFFO of $318 million and AFFO per share of $1.07. In conclusion, we are pleased to report another record quarter of results. Our team is executing well, driving considerable growth of revenue and EBITDA aligned with our Matterhorn plans. I would like to take the opportunity to thank our entire team for their efforts to support our customers and drive our growth. And with that, operator, will you please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Revenue management is continuing to drive healthy price realization in storage and services. Can you elaborate on, how you expect price actions to trend as inflation normalizes and discuss client sensitivity to pricing increases in the services business, compared to the storage business?
William Meaney: Yes. Thanks, George and good morning. So, I think that you can expect and you can see that through the course of the year, even as inflation has come off, is that we're continuing to be able to use revenue management across the board in our - especially in our records management business, and that's really based on how our customers value the services. So, we don't see any change in that trend. And in fact, in terms of customer retention, you've seen even a slight improvement in that during that period of time. So, just as the customers really understand the value that we're applying, and we're actually using revenue management to tap into that. So, we don't see any change in that trend.
Barry Hytinen: And George, it's Barry. Just to add on to that, I would say, as you think about the fourth quarter, we have revenue management actions that have been put in place in the third quarter that, will power another $20 million or $25 million of sequential growth even going forward here, in the fourth quarter. So that's part of the model, as you think about third quarter and fourth quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from Nate Crossett of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Nate Crossett: Hi. Good morning. Just a question on organic service revenue growth. Commentary sounded pretty positive on component pricing. So do you expect that, that metric will be positive in 4Q? And then just on Regency. Maybe you can talk about how the organic growth has been for that business year-to-date? And then lastly, just your expectation of RIM volumes heading into 4Q and next year? Thank you.
William Meaney: Thanks, Nate. Let me answer the question on Regency and then Barry will take your other two points. So on Regency, you can imagine they went through probably a similar growth profile that we saw in ALM. And they also have kind of, I would say, hit the low point probably about four months ago. And since then, they're actually growing kind of mid-single digits over the last, say, two, three, four months. And that's - they probably recovered a little bit faster than our business, but that's where the complementary mix of the two businesses is there, both in terms of the customers that they serve, and they do a lot more on the downstream processing, than the business that we have at Iron Mountain that we've acquired through IT renews. So, it's a good complementary fit. But we also see that they've actually, over the last few months, been growing single digits. Obviously, the business will continue to ramp, hence the pricing across the board starts improving.
Barry Hytinen: Nate, hi it's Barry. Thanks for those questions. On volume, as you saw in the quarter, we continue to grow volume, both in global records as well as in the corporate and other. And as you know, because you cover the company for so long, our expectation over the horizon is for volume to continue to be consistent to slightly up year in and year out. So, we are pleased with the volume continuing to trend at or even a little bit, better actually than our projections. And we continue to see that, both in the quarter coming as well as into the New Year. So very good and positive trends on the volume side. As it relates to service revenue, yes, we do expect service revenue to be up year-on-year, as I've talked about before, the second quarter was the hardest comp for our ALM business, because in light of what was going on in the prior year, that's when revenue for ALM was about $83 million in total. In the third quarter of last year, it was $60 million. And it was $56 million in the fourth quarter. And this year, it's $42 million in the second quarter and in the third quarter. And as Bill and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we expect our ALM business to be in the, let's say, low 50s. So that helps - with the standpoint of turning around the comp that, you'll see for the total company. The other thing is, just in light of project revenue. For example, in our digital and our global records services, we have incremental project revenue in the fourth quarter and some commencements, on some longer-term digital contracts occurring here in the fourth quarter, which will help our additional service revenue, and is favorable as it relates to the third quarter. As you know, some of that project revenue can be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And that's one of the reasons, why we are bullish on the sequential improvement in total revenue in the fourth quarter. So you'll see a little bit of an acceleration, thanks to ALM getting better and easier comp as well as the trending. We - as Bill mentioned last thing, since you asked about component pricing, we've only factored in what I would call a marginal modest improvement in pricing. And certainly, we are pleased to see pricing on memory rising, as much as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, but it's - we and the whole industry have been through a lot there. So we'll kind of be prudent and watch it before baking in too much into our numbers. Thanks, Nate.
Operator: The next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thanks. I was wondering if you could maybe put a finer point on helping us think about the impact of pricing actions in the room segment versus volume, kind of what the relative impacts were. And then for the ALM segment, I think you I talked about trying to get to $900 million in 2026. Is that still a number to think about? Or given the M&A that you've done with Regency and just the organic growth, any different way to think about that target?
William Meaney: No. Thanks, Jon. So I'll - let me take the ALM and then I'll let Barry talk a little bit more about pricing and volume trends. So on the ALM side, yes, we haven't backed off from our multiyear target that we shared at Investor Day, a little over a year ago. We still see the $900 million as a reasonable target in terms of the business trends, because one thing that we have continued to see is incoming volume. So if you look both year-over-year and year-to-date and sequentially is we do see volume continuing to grow and to ramp. And as Barry said, that we've seen now pricing starting to come back, whilst it's early green shoots, but 15% improvement in memory pricing, which you probably recall from our call last time is the bulk of the components that we sell on is - it shows that we're moving in the right direction to get back towards the type of pricing that we saw couple of years ago. So, if you put that all together and now with the additional capabilities that we're getting from the Regency acquisition is that both - they do a lot more on the downstream processing, which quite frankly, will not only allow us to harvest more value from the products that we're recycling from our customers, but it will also allow us to kind of expand, improve or accelerate our expansion into the OEM channels that we mentioned before. So I think you put that all together is that we feel very good about the targets that we laid out at our Investor Day.
Barry Hytinen: And John, it's Barry. Thanks for the question on revenue management in the quarter within our global RIM business. I would tell you if you look at the storage rental revenue growth there on an organic constant currency basis was 8%, so it was quite strong. And volume was modestly positive as you would see in our disclosures. So the vast majority of that was revenue management, although as we've talked about the last few quarters, we are seeing some positive mix in terms of driving top line revenue growth as well. So majority of its revenue management, a little - some mix and some improving volume trends. And going forward, as I mentioned in one of the earlier comments, we will see relatively speaking, incremental revenue management actions driving the business fourth quarter versus third.
Operator: The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I really want to focus just a little bit more on the ALM business trajectory. Just - what are you seeing in terms of like volumes coming in? I understand that the pricing is still low, but recovering. But just absolute volumes, how is that doing? And then also just understanding the Regency acquisition, like you said that it's $100 million of TTM revenue, but obviously, it was in a downward slope similar to what you guys were seeing. Is there a run rate that you can provide to us that we can think about that in terms of how to model that thing? And then maybe just keep focusing on a little bit more, what they add to Iron Mountain? What do you mean in terms of the downstream processing? What exactly is it that they do that you do not do?
William Meaney: Okay. So, Shlomo, let me talk a little bit about the - what we see on the volume trends, and then I'll let Barry put it together in terms of how you should think about modeling that going forward in terms of the business. I'll also come and pick up your point about what exactly Regency ads. So in terms of the volume trends, if you look at the enterprise side of our business, is there, the synergies, and as Barry said in his remarks, almost 100% cross-selling in terms of our ALM business. Is there you see almost triple-digit year-on-year increases in terms of volume that we're getting from our enterprise customers. So in the enterprise segment, we're seeing a really, really good volume. If you look at the hyperscale, which is the part of the business, that we acquired through IT renewal is the one that's most been impacted by what we see on the pricing of the components, which, as we said, is now just starting to move back north in the right direction. Is there, we actually see year-on - if you put year-to-date volume trends of incoming equipment, is we actually see double-digit - strong double-digit growth year-on-year, year-to-date incoming volume. And so the thing that's been muting that incoming volume, quite frankly, has been the pricing, but the good news is the pricing has started to improve. And Barry can help you think through how do you think about putting those two together as we project going forward. The last thing coming to Regency. So I'm glad you picked up on that because I probably should be more explicit on that. So Regency, first of all, they are adding a couple of customers into the portfolio that, quite frankly, we didn't have both in government sector and retail, which I think is really interesting in terms - because a lot of the equipment gets recycled by people dropping off at their retailers. So I think that's a really good capability there. But more importantly, is they actually are able to recycle a lot of what I would call the things that can't be reused directly into IT equipment. So things like we mentioned the plastics for pharmaceutical retailer. They do a lot more of that than we have historically. And the other thing, the other aspect is over the last couple of calls, we mentioned how we had signed up OEM relationships where these are laptop tablet manufacturers that are looking for people when their equipment comes off lease and needs to be recycled is they come to us and other people to actually resell - to refurbish and resell those products. And Regency has much more capability than we do in that area. They built up not only more expertise in refurbishing tablets and laptops than we have, but they also have a very nice e-commerce platform and where they can actually resell those. So they will really accelerate those - accelerate the sales for those channels that we mentioned on the last couple of calls, signing up the OEM manufacturers. So I think their capability will be a nice complementary fit to the contracts that we had already signed.
Barry Hytinen: So Shlomo, it's Barry. I appreciate the question. Specifically, on how to model Regency, just as a reminder, we are expecting it to close kind of around year-end or early next year for when you want to add it to your model. We noted that it's in excess of $100 million of revenue, Shlomo, and I expect them to exit the year at that level in excess of $100 million, and we see the opportunity for it to be growing into the new year. But of course, we'll give guidance for next year on our next call. But we feel very good about the stability of the business that it's been generating revenue and EBITDA at the levels it's been for some time. And as Bill alluded to, it did not see the sort of trough that our ALM business did on the hyperscale side. It's much more of an enterprise IT asset disposition sort of player. And in that enterprise and government services that it does its - didn't see the level of trough that we did, and it's come back nicely. And so we feel very good about the stability of the business at this point and feel like we're getting a very good, very synergistic deal as Bill mentioned, they have a fair bit of incremental capacity. And so we can get synergy off of bringing Iron Mountain Enterprise clients to Regency for service going forward. I would say - I'll just note that you can work through the math on this that it's sort of in the low mid-20s of an EBITDA margin business. We think that, that has opportunity to expand as relative pricing in the broader market expands and through incremental capacity utilization of the footprint of what they have there. We've been very impressed with the team at Regency for a long time. They've built a very good business with critically important relationships to clients. And we've got a very strong focus on sustainability. So we feel very good about Regency. And as I zoom out to broader ALM, Shlomo, I would say, just to reiterate a point Bill made, the volume is clearly kind of doing well. We are seeing incremental bookings, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, particularly on the enterprise side, on teams having good wins on the hyperscale side as well. And our OEM relationships continue to extend. That's an area that was a focus - has been a focus for us this year. We signed some very important relationships in that area of the market. Of course, it has - the nature of those relationships is that they take a little longer to get to revenue generating, but we are well on our way in the OEM vertical as well. So I appreciate the comment, Shlomo.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So Barry, I just wanted to touch on the balance sheet, obviously, a big move in interest rates recently. So I just wanted to touch on your deployment of CapEx and the sources and uses of capital. It does look like data center CapEx, as you've mentioned before, maybe you could touch on the trajectory there, that's probably going to continue to lift higher based on the leasing you've done year-to-date. And then maybe you could talk about your kind of achieve development yields on data center deals. It looks like those continue to move higher and how comfortable you are in terms of the excess returns you're getting over your current cost of capital for what's in your data center pipeline? Thank you.
William Meaney: So Eric, I'll take the - I'll talk about the yields that we're getting it. And then Barry can talk about the balance sheet impact and how we're thinking about financing it going forward. So I think on the yields, as you probably - were kind of foreshadowing in the nature of your question. We have seen yields moved up and in Barry's prepared remarks and I think also in mind. I talked about the price improvement or the strength of pricing around data center as demand continues to ramp. So historically, if you think about the journey that you've watched us on, Eric, is a few years ago, we would have said, hyperscale or kind of 7 to 8. I think on the most recent calls, we said hyperscale. These are cash-on-cash returns have been 8 to 9. And now you can expect that they are 9 plus. So we're - and these are all pre-leverage, cash-on-cash returns. So the returns are even with the ramp in the cost to build - well, the cost of build is obviously built in, but in terms of the cost of financing is well ahead after you put the data center together and lease it up is well ahead of our cost of capital. So we feel really good about the returns we're getting even in the higher interest rate environment.
Barry Hytinen: Hey, Eric, it's Barry. A couple of things there. We would expect CapEx for the whole company to be probably right around $1.3 billion for the year. That's up some from our prior view because, as you point out, the team continues to do very, very well on data center, and we have a lot of construction to do to service the contracts that the team has signed. It's an interesting point about our business within data center, and we're operating now 225 megawatts, which is nearly all leased. And then we're under construction on another 260 megawatts, of which again, like 90% plus, 93% of it is pre-leased. So we are really constructing to contract as opposed to spec. And so it is a situation where you will see us continue to be gradually rising the data center CapEx as we work to build into the contracts that we've signed. And I think it's - read it to the team and the customer wins that we've been having that we've been able to extend our lease expirations to eight plus years on the backs of higher pricing and those returns improving. So it's - we are feeling very good about where we're positioned with data center and the growth thereof, Eric. You're going to see a lot of growth going forward as we build into those leases. Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig in on the opportunity in Miami to convert storage facility to a data center. One, are you fully scrapping the existing facility and just using the land? Or are you actually using the existing infrastructure? And what do you see as the other opportunities throughout your portfolio to convert other facilities for data center purposes?
William Meaney: Good morning, Brendan. Thanks for the question. So the - yes, so in Miami, you probably can imagine, yes, we are actually scrapping the building. So we're reusing the land in that particular case because it's the way that we could get the most data center capacity into that facility, otherwise we would have been leaving much opportunity on the table. So it's a better use or a better way of actually tapping into that market. But it still gives us kind of - if you look at an all-in basis, probably a 15% reduction in cost to build. And obviously, the speed at which we can enter the market is much faster because trying to find the right location of land in Miami and secure the power can be challenging. So we think both in terms of speed and then 15% cost improvement, which is significant, is really important. And if you look more broadly of the 90 million square feet of industrial real estate that we have around the globe that's associated with our records management business is - think about that's probably in the order of 15% to 20% of the properties are under evaluation on any given day as we look at it. So we're constantly screening about 15% to 20% of our locations and looking at what customers' requirements are and in some cases, having discussions with customers and thinking about which of those sites might be next. And these are generally fit in very nicely for what I call these kind of edge deployments or secondary cities like Miami, right? So this won't be the last one that we - the first and the last. This will be the first of many, we feel as we continue to go forward.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Gillian Tiltman: Thank you, Andrea. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We're joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today for our discussion of our record second quarter results. Our team has once again exceeded expectations with performance reflective of our strong legacy of customer service, our laser focus on execution, and our dedication to finding innovative solutions to serve our customers as they evolve their businesses. I'm excited to share that in the second quarter we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.36 billion and record EBITDA of $476 million. This performance is ahead of the expectations we provided last quarter. The enhanced operation model we created through Project Matterhorn has continued to prove successful as our commercial team is empowered to sell the entire Mountain range of products and solutions across our portfolio. We are pleased with the high quality and wide range of our offerings today which positions us to be a nimble partner to serve our customers' needs. To highlight some of our results in the second quarter, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 11% and drove high-teens organic growth in both our data center and digital services businesses. We are also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has increased our quarterly dividend per share to $0.65 or $2.60 per share annualized, commencing with our third quarter dividend to be paid in October. As we have said before, when our AFFO payout ratio reached the mid to low 60s as a percentage, we would increase the dividend. Our payout ratio at the end of the second quarter was just under 64%. I would like to begin our broader discussion of some of the customer wins, which led to our record second quarter results. Let me start with records management, where our success was derived from both new and existing customers. One significant win we would like to highlight this quarter was with a large not-for-profit hospital system, faced with rising lease costs, despite a shrinking storage footprint, the customer turned to us for an alternative to storing in their own space. Our Smart Sort solution will address their needs over the next three years. It will deliver cost efficiency and optimize storage space for the customer before they transfer their records to an Iron Mountain facility for secure future management. This win exemplifies our commitment to solving our customers' problems and providing them with tailored solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic has led organizations around the world to reassess their current real estate portfolios in order to accommodate remote and hybrid work. Our customers are optimizing their real estate to accommodate changing working practices, we are able to offer solutions that demonstrate the breadth of our portfolio and the value of partnering with Iron Mountain across our products and services. One example is a customer who chose our Clean Start solution to remove and relocate records, office equipment, and IT assets from more than 60 offices across North America that are being closed or decommissioned over the next two years. Thanks to our Asset Lifecycle Management solutions, we are also helping this customer to decommission IT assets from these offices securely and sustainably. We continue to see growing momentum for our digital business with customers turning to us for solutions in areas such as public sector, industry focused solutions, and end-to-end business process management. For example, we are proud to be supporting the digitization of real estate mortgage records held by the Helinick Land Registry in Greece under a two year contract worth $35 million. We demonstrated our understanding of the public sector in Greece and of the European Commission's recovery and resilience facility, which is funding this project through the Greek government to support European economies as they transform the way they support their citizens. This is a breakthrough deal that will provide further opportunities to support similar digitization projects elsewhere in Europe. Another example of how our digital business is enabling us to develop and deliver transformational solutions for our largest customers is with one of the biggest financial service companies in the United States. This customer is outsourcing its noncore services and has selected Iron Mountain to manage all of its records. Our end-to-end solution ensures a secure chain of custody regardless of media format for this customer, leveraging our image on demand service and InSight platform to integrate seamlessly with their customer success management system. This game changing deal demonstrates the power of partnering with Iron Mountain to accelerate our customer's digital transformation. Staying with our Digital Solutions business, our 25 year relationship with a Fortune 500 gas and electric utility company continues to be a powerful example of how our customers turn to Iron Mountain because of the range of solutions we can provide. To ensure our customer is compliant with all legal and regulatory requirements we are digitizing around 20 million images from 8,000 boxes stored with Iron Mountain over the next three years. Having provided records management and data management services since 1998, our customer was confident in our Digital Solutions secure chain of custody, information governance expertise, and ability to scale up quickly to deliver this project. To conclude with records management, on 29th June we acquired the controlling interest in Clutter, a tech enabled on demand consumer storage company. We were previously a minority investor in Clutter and provided storage and operational services through a commercial partnership. This acquisition makes us the industry leader in valet self-storage services in North America. Turning to asset lifecycle management, we continue to see muted pricing for the largest part of this business, which relies on reselling used memory, hard drives and CPUs we receive from hyperscalers. That being said, pricing is stabilized, and we do expect to see an improvement as we head into next year. Moreover, you will recall that our ALM business has three components: hyperscale decommissioning, which is highly dependent on component pricing; enterprise ITAD or IT asset disposition; and original equipment manufacturers or OEMs. In these later categories, we are seeing marked growth and traction. For example, in the enterprise segment, our focus on cross selling the Mountain range of products has driven bookings up a 175% versus second quarter last year. For the OEM segment, you will recall that we signed our first MSA or Master Services Agreement in this area last quarter and we have added another MSA with a second OEM this quarter. Turning to specific wins in the ALM area, a good example of our cross selling appeal comes from the health care industry. A customer which has benefited from Iron Mountain's records management solutions for many years has asked us to manage the recovery, decommissioning, disposal and/or recycling of IT assets at over 2,000 locations in the United States. The strength of our relationship and our customers inherent trust in Iron Mountain has resulted in an ALM contract and renewal of our existing services for the next five years. Also in ALM, our team secured a contract with a leading software and technology company to help them decommission racks of servers and nonessential IT equipment from their data center. Opportunities like this where we are able to extend the value we provide to customs has been significantly enhanced, thanks to the industry knowledge and expertise we have gained through our acquisition and integration of IT renew. We remain very excited about ALM, whilst component pricing remains a drag for part of the business, the growth we are achieving in the services side of the business shows how Iron Mountain's brand strength around security, and reliability are a differentiator in this fast growing area. Moving to our data center business, through the first half of the year we leased 55 megawatts, which includes 2.7 megawatts this quarter. As we said in May the first quarter was particularly strong as we signed some deals earlier than expected. Due to our strong pipeline we now feel confident we will exceed our original projection of 80 megawatts in 2023. This confidence is thanks to our teams delivering record new sales in the first half as well as the size of our late-stage pipeline from some of our largest customers as they add new capacity with the growth of AI. For example, we are well positioned with nearly 120 megawatts of unleased capacity on our Nova campus with our fully secured. In this very important market, we are pleased to note that pricing is moving up appreciably. Staying with our business, I would like to highlight a win that demonstrates the exciting opportunities to expand our solutions and services for customers with a footprint in India and the value of our joint venture with Web Werks in the country. As we've discussed before, India is a key focus for our company's growth and our progress there is a major win for our business. In the second quarter, we closed a deal with a multinational media processing company to provide almost 1 megawatt of storage capacity at our Mumbai data center with the potential to add a further 5 megawatts at this facility and extra capacity at other locations in India. Our data centers team's experience of handling high-density racks, Iron Mountain's wider understanding of the media industry and our expansion plans in Mumbai helped us to convince our customer that we are their best long-term partner as their capacity needs grow. Finally, I would like to mention an example of the success we are enjoying in our Crozier Fine Arts business as we build out one of the few globally integrated logistics, storage, and top-quality services businesses in the art world. Recently, we partnered with a major art gallery in the United Kingdom to support an exhibition by well-known artists. This involves detailed planning and preparations to pack and transports 61 fragile sculptures from the US, Mexico, and Continental Europe. We are proud of the unique expertise that our Crozier teams provide for our customers and to be associated with important exhibitions like this one. To conclude, we are proud of the record results we delivered this quarter as this is evidence that our strategy is working. As we continue to leverage the potential of our entire Mountain range, expand our footprint of storage and services, and deliver tailored innovative solutions for each of our customers, I could not be more grateful for the hard work of our mountaineers. Our Matterhorn program is showing the way and delivering consistently strong sales growth, whilst fueling AFFO growth and our dividend. We are more energized than ever to continue reaching new peaks. And I’m excited for the bright future ahead. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the second quarter, our team achieved solid performance across all metrics, exceeding the projections we shared in May. Revenue grew to a record $1.36 billion, up 5% year-on-year on a reported basis and 6% on an organic and constant currency basis. Revenue was above the expectations we provided on our last call driven by outperformance in both our Global RIM and data center businesses. For me, a key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage rental revenue, which grew 11%. I'll note, this performance was on top of a stronger year-on-year comp and represents an acceleration in rate of growth. This reflects strong contributions from revenue management, data center commences, and positive volume trends. Total service revenue was $527 million, down 1% on a constant currency basis. This was consistent with our projections, which factored in the previously discussed year-on-year component price declines. Importantly, component pricing was consistent in the second quarter on a sequential basis. While this represents a significant headwind year-on-year, we are pleased that pricing has stabilized. As a reminder, that affects our IT renew business most prominently. Excluding our ALM business, service revenue was up 8% on a constant currency basis. This would have resulted in total company revenue growth of 9%. Adjusted EBITDA was $476 million, a new record, up 5% year-on-year with revenue management and strong data center commencements being the key drivers. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35%, in line with our expectations, driven by revenue management and mix. AFFO was $277 million or $0.94 on per share basis, up $6 million and $0.01 respectively from the second quarter of last year. This was well ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call. Now turning to segment performance. In the second quarter, our Global RIM business achieved revenue of $1.16 billion, an increase of $89 million year-on-year, reflecting organic revenue growth of 9%. Revenue management and positive volume trends contribute to strong organic storage rental revenue growth of 9.2%. We delivered organic service revenue growth of 9.3%, driven by Digital Solutions, which were up 20% year-on-year and continued strength in core offerings. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $499 million, an increase of $30 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business, the team deliver [Technical Difficulty] From a total revenue perspective we achieved 17% growth on an organic basis. Organic storage rental revenue growth was particularly strong at 22%, driven by commencements and improved pricing. As we projected, data center services were down year-on-year, given the fit out work we were performing in the first half of last year. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2022 represented the last quarter of these specific fit out services. We will have a more normalized comp on this line going forward. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $54 million, representing 27% growth. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we signed 2.7 megawatts in the quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 55 megawatts. As Bill mentioned, we are well on track to achieve our leasing projection for the full year of 80 megawatts. And in fact, with the strength of our building pipeline, we have line of sight to exceed this projection. Turning to asset life cycle management, in the second quarter, revenue grew 4% on a sequential basis, slightly ahead of the projections we gave on our last call. We are seeing positive momentum across all three verticals of our ALM business, which include: hyperscale decommissioning; enterprise ITAD, and OEM. You will recall that China was mostly free of restrictions in the first half of last year, but it returned to tight lockdowns in the second half. As a result, as we anniversary the second quarter comparisons going forward will be much more favorable. While we are diversifying away from China, it is the largest market into which we sell components today. At the beginning of this year, as lockdowns eased, while component volumes increased, pricing declined to record low levels. Industry analysts project March improvement in pricing by the fourth quarter and even more significantly in 2024. To be prudent we have not factored any pricing improvement into our outlook for 2023. Turning to capital. In the second quarter we invested $320 million, of which $287 million was growth and $33 million was recurring. In 2023, we now expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion, up $200 million from our prior expectations. This reflects an increase to our data center development plans given our strong leasing year-to-date and building pipeline that I mentioned. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times, reflecting a meaningful improvement from last year. We have remained at this leverage level for the past three quarters and at March our lowest leverage level since 2017. Importantly, we expect to exit 2023 at this level even with our increased investment in data center. Turning to our dividend. On a trailing four quarter basis our payout ratio was now 63.9% and approximately 400 basis point improvement from this time last year. As you saw earlier today, we are pleased to announce that our board of directors has authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 5%, bringing it to $0.65 per share to be paid in early October. This is consistent with our long term commentary that as our payout ratio settles into the mid to low 60s as a percentage of AFFO, you should expect the dividend to rise. We remain dedicated to our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we are funding our growth objectives, while continuing to drive meaningful shareholder returns. And now, turning to our projections. For the full year, reflecting our performance in the first half and strong outlook, we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in excess of $1.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approaching $500 million, AFFO of approximately $290 million and AFFO per share of approximately $0.99. I would like to provide a bit more context for our guidance. In terms of revenue, our third quarter projection equates to growth of 9% as compared to prior year. To frame that, I would recommend investors consider the following points. First, the prior year comparable in our ALM business is much easier in the third and fourth quarters of this year as compared to the first half. Second, we have incremental revenue management actions, which will go into effect in the third and fourth quarters, and will provide a nice tailwind. Lastly, if you consider the underlying trends in the rest of the business, growth has been accelerating for several quarters now our Matterhorn efforts are driving performance. For example, excluding our ALM business, the rest of the business's growth rate was 8% in the first quarter, 9% in the second quarter and our projection is for 10% in the third quarter. And just as a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2022 is our easiest growth comparable this year. To conclude, our team continues to execute well and remains focused on driving our growth agenda. We have a growing and well diversified pipeline and we are positioned to achieve our objectives. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their efforts and contributions. And with that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: We’ll now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In the ALM business, performance was impacted by component price declines. And you noted that you saw signs of stabilization in component prices. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that? What trend specifically did you see on component prices, and how would you deconstruct ALM growth between pricing and volumes?
Barry Hytinen: Okay. Hi, George. This is Barry. Thank you for the question. Yes, let me help you with that. From a standpoint of the way the decommissioning and component price business has been unfolding this year. As you know, early this year, late last year and into early this year, component pricing was dropping quite appreciably. And by about the February time frame, it had reached over essentially all time record lows. And that's really across the gambit of component pricing from memory to CPUs, all the various components that we're selling. And, that has obviously been a significant impact for both Iron Mountain, but also for many other players in the technology industry. I think importantly what you've seen, and I'm sure you would have been following this, many of the OEMs have significantly reduced their production of new components, which is now limiting supply in the marketplace. And of course, used component pricing tends to directly correlate and follow with new. And so, what we've seen here since the component pricing hit the lows in the kind of February timeframe is, importantly, pricing has been very consistent. In fact, some components have been ticking up. We've seen that in certain elements of memory among other component pricing. So, what we've worked into our outlook though, George, is that, we are keeping component pricing in our outlook for this year at this record level low levels. And our thought process is, that's a prudent way to plan. When you look at industry analysts, then there's -- this is publicly available data, there are many estimates that project for component pricing to begin to lift as we move through the remainder of 2023 and in fact have very, very sharp increases in most component pricing next year in light of supply and demand expectations. As I said, we're not baking that into our 2023 outlook for prudent reasons. We are anticipating that our total ALM business will be up just a few million dollars on a sequential basis in the third quarter. And then will be up again in the fourth quarter, but that speaks to the points that Bill made in his prepared remarks that, for example, in our enterprise ITAD business, bookings are up a tremendous amount in the second quarter year-on-year. We are winning more decommissioning business across that decommissioning vertical. And of course, our OEM teams have been winning very important wins for us, which I think set us up very well for the intermediate and longer term in the broader asset lifecycle management space. Volume on a sequential basis was essentially equivalent, George, which we felt good about. And I would say the forward pipeline as it relates to volume in light of what I've just mentioned is favorable for us. So we feel that we are now getting through the hardest comps of the year. As you know, last year, we were $72 million, -- $71 million, $72 million of revenue in the first quarter with ALM, we were $83 million in the second quarter. That dropped quite appreciably to $60 million in the third and $55 million or so in the fourth. So that goes to my point about the comps get easier with pricing being flat to up, we feel well positioned. Thanks, George.
Operator: The next question comes from Nate Crossett of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Nate Crossett: Thank you. So is it fair to say, I guess, that the service revenue growth year-over-year, like, this is the low quarter in 2Q? And that we should expect maybe it to trend out from here? And then maybe just comment on storage rental growth that still remains very strong. Can you maybe just speak to recent customer conversations and your ability to push price?
Barry Hytinen: Okay. Thanks, Nate. This is Barry. Couple things there. So, on services, yes, you are thinking about that right, because really when you look at the total company's service revenue growth, it was completely impacted by the fact that the ALM business was essentially half that which it was in the prior year. And at that some $40 million of revenue, that's a big drag on the service in total because, as you know, all of the ALM revenue essentially is on the service line. And I'll give you a point that if you look at Global RIM, for example, our service revenue there was up over 9%. And so, the total company's service revenue will be improving. It should be positive in the third quarter, of course, and furthermore in the fourth quarter because, frankly, by then ALM no longer is a drag on our service revenue. In fact, I think it may even -- there's a chance it may be accretive to growth rate in service by the fourth quarter. In terms of storage rental revenue growth, we have had -- as your question alludes to, strong performance there and our revenue management actions have been very well received. We are, of course, very focused on driving value for our customers and making sure that they understand the significant value that Iron Mountain provides, both in terms of our core offerings of records and -- but also all the other offerings that we can cross sell around things such as enterprise IT asset disposition, data center services, among other. And so, in terms of where you should expect storage rental revenue growth, volume has been trending very consistent with our expectations. It's been modestly positive and we continue to expect that positive outlook. And from a revenue standpoint, total revenue standpoint, you should expect it to continue to be comping quite well. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do have some incremental revenue management actions in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And that helps the growth rate, particularly in the fourth quarter, Nate, because as you may remember, last year more of our revenue management actions were shifted into the third quarter just from a timing of what we were doing last year. And this year, it's a little bit spread out. So these new revenue management actions that I alluded to today on the call, that's incremental to our prior plans and will be, as I said, a nice tailwind to growth rate. So thank you for the question, Nate.
William Meaney: Yes. And just one thing I would add for Nate on the storage trend sort of volume, you probably picked up from some of the wins we highlighted is that, as companies are shifting their use of space as the workforce is more remote or hybrid. That's yielding both increased volume for our storage facilities as they clean out or decide that they want to have it depoed rather than in an office that people don't visit as much or at all anymore. As well as, as Barry pointed out, [indiscernible] behind this 175% year-over-year increase in ITAD bookings, both because as companies are kind of cleaning out, it's a tailwind both on the storage in the ITAD business.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Alex Hess: Yes. Hi. This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. Maybe just to dig in on Global RIM for a second. Can you remind us what percent of storage revenues are in some manner CPI linked with -- maybe what the price floor and lease terms look like nowadays? And then just quickly on Clutter, how does that factor into your outlook and maybe some thoughts around that business, which we understand had some cash flow issues as a standalone company on its own. Thanks guys.
Barry Hytinen: Okay. Hi, Alex. It's Barry. Thanks for those questions. For proprietary and confidential reasons, we don't generally characterize our contracts too specifically. But what I'll say is, certainly as you know, you follow the company for such a long time, we have a very large number of customers, 200 -- call it, 200,000 plus client relationships. The vast majority of those are on our standard, if you will, paper that allows us to affect revenue management actions. And as I said before, we are very aligned with driving value.at times of essentially our choosing and is not, if you will, linked to any sort of indices. There are some, what I would describe as more bespoke contracts with some of our largest clients, which may have specific agreements around escalators and the like, but that is the -- that is a small number of total contracts. With respect to Clutter, appreciate that question. As just to help others who may not be as familiar with Clutter. Clutter is a business that we have had a minority stake in for a while now and it was a form of a joint venture. We own about 25% of the company prior to the transaction that we mentioned this morning. And that's on the valet self-storage. So it is a business that we have been providing, if you will, back end services too for some time in storing a fair bit of the volume that Clutter had been bringing in from consumers. And what Clutter's focus had been on is building a brand and aggregating consumer demand, principally in, as Bill mentioned, tech enabled manner. On a net basis, when all is said and done, we'll pay a little over some $20 million to buy the business will also contribute various of our assets. So you'll see that through our other expense and income line on the P&L. And from a standpoint, for your modeling purposes, revenue on a quarterly basis, this being the incremental revenue that Iron Mountain will recognize now because, of course, we were recognizing revenue from what we were doing for services to Clutter previously. We'll recognize maybe a bit over $10 million. It'll be an excess of $10 million on a quarterly basis, likely to be growing as we move into the New Year. And from an EBITDA standpoint and you would have seen this from our prior filings because, of course, we were absorbing our minority interest in Clutter through our P&L. As I said, they've been building their brand for some time. So it is -- Clutter has been absorbing a modest EBITDA loss on a quarterly basis, thinks something in the vicinity of a couple of $1 million a quarter over time and perhaps by, let's say, 2024, we expect to be able to drive that to breakeven and ultimately to generating positive EBITDA out of the Clutter Enterprise itself as we drive operating synergies by combining the two businesses together. I'll just note, of course, Iron Mountain had been generating positive EBITDA on the relationship previously. So the incremental negative drag that I just referenced is purely off of the brand building elements of the clutter enterprise itself. The last thing I'll note is -- Alex is, of course, we reiterated our guidance and feel very good about it, despite absorbing that little drag there from Clutter that we will absorb here in the second half. So appreciate the questions.
Operator: The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much. Could you talk a little bit about the gross margin trends? They were --look like they were down particularly in the services, down like 200 basis points year-over-year. Does that have to do with something from ALM or something else? I saw the labor costs were up almost 10% year-over-year. And, also, I thought maybe you could just comment. Bill, I always add you about talking about the underlying trends in the volumes in the wind business. If you could just comment on that, are you getting more positive trends in the historical mature markets than what we've seen before. You mentions, like, that hospital contract. Is that something that was going to lead to more positive volume trends in an area that historically been a little bit more of a weaker trends.
William Meaney: Okay. Let me start with the labor costs and the trends in terms of the volume. So I think, first, starting off on the volume trends is, as I was saying to Nate -- to Nate's question is that, overall, the volume, as you can see, is flat, slightly up. So it's trending in the right direction. And I wouldn't say this is a -- it's going to be a massive change. But what we see, if you think about 730 million cubic feet, so it's a very large base that we're operating on, is the trends that we see both in some of the new storage areas, but as well as what we see in people going into a hybrid or remote working aspect. It really is getting a lot more traction for our Smart Sort and Clean Start type solutions, which uncover more storage, also the services that we can provide being depoed. In other words, we can serve their employees anywhere they are. They don't have to come to the office to actually get information back, whether we give it back to them physically or image on demand. And then it's also uncovering, as we say, is driving a lot of the increased bookings that we see in the enterprise ALM side of the business and fueling that 175% growth that we see. So overall, we feel really good about where the trends are, but you can imagine, on 730 million cubic feet around the world, is that -- even what I call quite macro trends that I described are --don't change the overall trajectory like massively, but it is definitely a tailwind for that business. And on labor costs, before I hand it back to Barry is, you're right, labor costs is up. Some of it is as we go into new areas in terms -- as we ramp, or some of the projects that we ramp on, then obviously we're bringing labor in ahead of time. And the other part is making sure that our mountaineers around the world are well looked after, because we really do see the -- it's the core to us. We're a business services company. And the first impression that our customers have is our mountaineers, and we want to make sure that they and their families are well looked after. And the inflation environment globally has been challenging for a number of our colleagues.
Barry Hytinen: Yeah. Shlomo, this is Barry. Maybe I'll just pick up there on [Technical Difficulty] you would have seen a similar increase in the first quarter when we made the actions as it relates to improved wages that Bill was just referring to. And then, I would point out on a sequential basis, labor was up about 2%, while service revenue was up 5% on a sequential basis, reflecting the [Technical Difficulty] down year-on-year. As your question alluded to, that has all to do with our component pricing, IT renew, because when you think about it, we are still processing a considerable amount of volume, yet we are recognizing a much lower price. And so, if you excluded the impact of component pricing, actually service gross margins were up quite nicely, which speaks to the ongoing trend in the rest of the core and frankly to the productivity that the team is driving in asset lifecycle management. So when you think about what could happen with our gross margins as pricing recovers, we've got a lot of operating leverage in that business. So I feel good about the forward look if the industry projections are anywhere close to accurate for where pricing will be next year, I think we're going to see a really nice lift there. So thanks, Shlomo.
Operator: The next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you. Couple of questions. First, just interested in how to kind of frame the exposure in your data center business to [indiscernible] where there's a lease in in Phoenix. And then, interested in just the data center development pipeline and kind of the opportunities ahead and your thoughts about bringing in third-party capital to maybe co-invest. There was obviously a recent transaction in India and in other countries where third-party capital is [indiscernible] in the development projects of some of the established players and your thoughts on pursuing that route from a capital standpoint? Thanks.
William Meaney: Okay. Thanks, Jon. I'll start with the -- what we see on the data center horizon and the I’ll turn it over to Barry. I think first of all, we're really pleased with how our data center business continues to grow. And also, as you know, I know you cover the industry extremely closely is that, pricing is up markedly, like as we look in markets like Northern Virginia on a triple net basis as we see around the hyperscale segment, pricing up some 40% so the returns continue to grow and keep pace. I think in terms of -- looking at the size of our pipeline, Barry mentioned [Technical Difficulty] million on top of the $1 billion that we already had for investment capital in 2023. Based on the strength of that pipeline and the success that we're having, pretty much across the globe is that -- I mean, you're right that we're always kind of conscious of in terms of how we fund our projects. That being said, we're actually fortunate that we have the records management business and our other services business, which is like a financial beast. I mean, it just generates a tremendous amount of cash that not only fuels the dividend, but it also fuels a lot of the development capital into our data centers. So I wouldn't say that we're in a situation where kind of a company that is solely in the date center space that has only to itself to look for in terms of how it funds itself going forward to drive a lot of the development. We actually have a growing, but some people will consider a mature business in terms of the amount of capital we have to put into that because it’s a very scaled high operating leverage business and we are able to use funds and profitability from that to fund a big part of our development. That being said, as you know, that we've done -- we have taken third-party capital a couple of times already, and we typically do that on stabilized or near stabilized assets and tap into funds that where people are looking for relatively low yielding, but long maturity or duration type assets. And we'll continue to do that as some of our portfolio stabilizes. I can imagine that we would recycle capital when the opportunity presents itself. But overall, if you look at the plan that we laid out last September in terms of our Investor Day, we're probably a little bit ahead of that in data center just because of the growth that we've been seeing in the first half of this year and what we see in the pipeline. But we feel pretty good about that we have a fully funded plan in terms of the way we're doing it now. But if there's opportunities, as I say, to take third-party capital, especially around stabilized assets, generally that boost our returns long term and we will do that.
Barry Hytinen: Hey, Jon. It’s Barry. Thanks for the question. We for natural and perhaps obvious reasons we don't tend to comment on individual clients. But as you noted, there are some things out there in the public domain as well as in their filings that would confirm that they are client of ours in Arizona. That's obviously a very long-standing relationship that goes back to prior to our ownership of one of the data centers that we purchased there. I mentioned that intently because, of course, it's a long standing contract with pricing that goes back quite a ways and, frankly, is sort of a -- almost a build to suit type of situation for them where it would not be [Technical Difficulty] let me put it this way. In Arizona, we are essentially a 100% [Technical Difficulty] we are 100% lease now in Scottsdale on what we're under construction for in our second facility, phase 5 and 6, were 100% -- 5 and 8, we're 100% leased as well in terms of prelease. So it's not a particularly large revenue client, Jon. And beyond that, I wouldn't want to comment, but you would see in the filings the relative amount of, let's say, credit that we have between the two entities. And I feel very confident that in light of where we see pricing, and I'll just -- maybe I should just add this. That in general, on hyperscale pricing today, we're seeing on a triple net basis pricing up about 40%. And so, we feel very good about where data center is trending on a macro basis and where we are. And one last point, just build on thing Bill was mentioning. And when you look at our, I think there's a unique part of our data center story is, we're operating about 220 megawatts. We're nearly fully leased on that. And we're under construction on about another 200 megawatts. And the thing to think about that is, we're not building to [Technical Difficulty] anything, and we're 91% prelease on everything that we have [Technical Difficulty] doing a phenomenal job, and we're working hard to figure out which other facilities to start construction on as the pipeline continues to build quite appreciably. So we feel really good about where our data center business is trending, Jon. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much, and thanks for the disclosures. Hey, Barry, can we unpack the guidance a little bit? I just want to make sure understand, because it seems like you reiterated the full year. But if I think about the puts and takes, it sounds like the pricing is a lot better. The CapEx is going up a lot. And, again, that may not be revenue that comes in. It looks like the Q2 is a little better. It looks like the Clutter is going to have some incremental revenue modestly. Is that offset the ALM business, or is it just a little bit of conservatism? And just, as you put that all together, how should we think about cash flow for the full year, not operating, but just what the use of cash should be, particularly given the step-up in the CapEx.
Barry Hytinen: Okay. Thanks Kevin. Appreciate that. You're right that our revenue management program is doing very, very well. And obviously, our storage rental revenue growth has been growing. And as I mentioned, some of our growth rates are actually accelerating that being one of those. And that's thanks to both our Global RIM teams, as well as our data center teams, because commencements has been very strong. You referenced that CapEx is up, as I mentioned, that's going to build out our data center portfolio that's already preleased. So we are endeavoring to meet all customer demand, which continues to ramp. In terms of -- you are right, Clutter adds a relatively small amount of revenue. We probably are a touch more conservative with ALM in the back half, Kevin, than where we were at the beginning of the year because, of course, at the beginning of the year component pricing was still -- was still coming down. And now it's stabilized we've recognized that those stable levels of pricing. As I said, that may prove to be conservative as we move through the year, but we are only halfway through. So we tend to try to not get ahead of ourselves, Kevin. In terms of cash generation and the compilation of the incremental CapEx. Here’s what I'd underscore. We have reiterated our leverage expectations that we will be at 5.1 times at year end, which is consistent with where we are today, and at a multiyear level low. So we feel really good about the cash generation of the business. We're generating incrementally higher returns in data center on that CapEx investment. Returns on hyperscale have moved from kind of the seven, eight level to more like eight, nine, and retail cash on levered returns are also quite firm. And so, we're blending into that low double digit vicinity on a combined basis. We feel really good about where things are trending, Kevin, so appreciate your questions.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Hi. Thanks for the questions. Two, if I could. So, just wanted to touch again on the data center pipeline. Any requirements you see that you think are tied to this wave of generative AI demand we're hearing about in the industry? And does that change at all how you design your data center for some of the higher densities that are required for these types of deployments? And then secondly, on the hyperscale ALM business. I know you talked about China COVID shutdowns impacting that business. Has there been any move to kind of diversify your end markets to resale beyond China to help reduce the concentration there? Thank you.
William Meaney: Thanks, Eric. So, yes, on the trends that we're seeing, I mean, and you've been following this industry for [EON's] (ph). I think you see the same thing I did -- we have, right? I mean, maybe a year ago we saw -- still very high growth in high scale, but they're probably a little bit more conservative. And now there's another wave of really accelerated growth because they're trying to keep pace with the amount of compute power is required to really run a lot of these large language models associated with the AI programs. And so, we have seen a -- it's not just type, but we actually see virtually all of our largest hyperscale customers coming to us looking for more capacity. And that's why we were speaking with such confidence that we'll exceed our original full year guidance in terms of the amount of leasing activity we expect. It's just -- it is very, very strong. Now in terms of the type of deployment, you're also right that the density that they're looking for is much higher. And I think I'm right to say probably year, year and a half ago we didn't have any customers coming to us and asking us to water cool in racks to actually support some of these higher densities. And now we are seeing a number of deployments that are requiring that kind of design. Luckily, I mean, we built our designs to be flexible. And of course, for these large deployments, we're actually doing the design to meet the customer, very specific customer requirements. So we're able to accommodate the higher density quite easily. But you're right. I mean, with the density that some folks are looking at and the amount of power they want to put in a rack, we are cooling using different methods and specifically some water cooling in rack to support the requirements.
Barry Hytinen: And Eric, it's, Barry. As it relates to diversifying away from China, as we've talked about before, that certainly is a focus of the team. We have added to our organization in ALM and specifically around diversifying the downstream channels, we are making steady progress, but it is slow because, of course, as we've said before, China is the main market for us in that regard. But we are looking at and branching into throughout Southeast Asia there are opportunities we think over the intermediate term in India. We certainly have been selling more components into the U.S. and Europe as well, and that's a key focus, as well as the Mid-East. So there is -- there are opportunities there, and we are building that -- those channels The other thing I'll just build on and link the two questions is, when you think about hyperscale decommissioning, we generally are decommissioning data centers that were put into service, let's say, five years prior. And so -- on average. And the thing about AI in this very significant ramp in terms of hyperscale data center development right now is, it will provide even another leg to our hyperscale decommissioning growth five years on. Historically I've had some questions about like, well, how does the decommissioning business continue to ramp over time? And of course, the things that we'll be decommissioning this year are components that were put in place about five years ago. And next year, we'll be decommissioning things that were put in place four years ago. And as those data center platforms have grown, it provides that much larger of a platform for us to decommission in the future. And I think it shouldn't be lost on us that of this AI growth is going to drive another substantial leg up in the opportunity for hyperscale decommissioning in the future. And as the leader in that space, we feel quite good about the future.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Brendan Lynch of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask on the storage -- excuse me, the retention rate in the Global RIM business, it looks like you contracted about 100 basis points year-over-year and it's at, probably the lowest level in the past few years. I understand that the storage business has generated really strong growth, driven by price, but maybe you could kind of square some of those dynamics there as well.
Barry Hytinen: Okay. Hi, Brendan. It’s a -- thanks for the question. When you look at that metric, I'll just remind you that it is on a trailing four quarter basis. So what you've got going on there is -- what you've got going on there is an element of COVID still because we were naturally seeing client fell little bit less activity of switching and/or disruption, what have you, during the COVID period and even in the period after we all felt like COVID was over, if you will. And so, that's a little bit of catching up. But if you look back on that metric over, let’s say, the last 15 years and that data is available in our historic disclosure, you'd find that we're in a very tight band and not outside our normal levels from a pre COVID standpoint. I appreciate the question. I will tell you that we feel we feel -- we are -- our customer relationships are very good. We can -- as you linked it to revenue management, I would say our focus on revenue management is continuing to educate our customers on the very significant value we drive for them day in and day out. And the fact that our volume continues to trend positively, I think, should give you a very good indicator there of how we're doing with our customers.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-04 14:25:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Gillian Tiltman: Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and in our annual report -- on our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.  In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking the time to join us today. Our team delivered another quarter of record results for the first quarter of 2023, exceeding our expectations. This performance reflects the resonance of our expanded product portfolio, our unmatched customer relationships and the strength of our dedicated team.  On a reported basis, in the first quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.31 billion, yielding 7.5% total organic revenue growth and EBITDA of $461 million. We continue to be encouraged by the increased demand for our services across key markets fueling these results as well as the success of Project Matterhorn, enabling our commercial teams to offer our customers access to the widest range of solutions in our company's history. We delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 11% in the first quarter, and we drove high-teens organic growth in both our data center and digital services businesses.  As we introduced last year with Project Matterhorn, our steady build-out of new products and services as well as growth in these underlying markets continues to accelerate us on our growth trajectory path. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight how we have been serving our customers with our solutions-based approach and our offerings across the Mountain range. Beginning with records management, we won significant new business in the United Kingdom with a major global industrial and aerospace company signing a contract valued at GBP 40 million. Following more than a year of conversations, the team entered into a bespoke 10-year agreement, providing the customer with several hundred thousand cubic feet of secure physical data storage, document digitization and management across multiple secure locations, radio frequency identification tagging for additional security and a dedicated on-site team of experts working to Iron Mountain's industry-leading standards.  I am pleased we could offer such a comprehensive solution that allows the customer to both digitize their data and protect their business. We are now discussing additional opportunities with the same customer in other European countries, North America and Asia. In total, the potential contract value over 10 years is approximated to be GBP 90 million.  Another win that highlights our ability to sell the entire Mountain range involves a state historical society, which turned to both Iron Mountain and our Fine Art Storage Business Crozier for help in preserving the history of its cultural heritage center, which is home to its underground archives in museum. With budget as a key consideration for this customer, our unique solution was focused on reducing costs, whilst leveraging our expertise and innovation to challenge the customer to think differently.  Our combined art, library, archives and logistics expertise enabled our team to deliver a solution that met the state's needs. Also in the quarter, a financial services company based in Australia, a long-standing customer of Iron Mountain turned to us for help with their compliance issues after being impressed by the information we presented at a Policy Center webinar back in 2021.  Our suite of digital enablement solutions and software, including the InSight platform will provide the customer with increased visibility into its archives, digital copy as selected records, auto generation of metadata and auto reduction of personal identifiable information. Success stories such as this highlight the value we provide customers and not only moving data from physical to digital storage, but also improving the methods and capability to utilize the data.  Another digital win was with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The U.S. Congress has requested that the VA advanced the production of complete and accurate veteran records in a timely fashion, driving the need for digitization of historical veteran documents, which are often dispersed across multiple storage locations. The customer required an experienced digital partner to increase their scanning capacity and also provide facility oversight, chain of custody logistics and secure storage. The unique aspects provided by our high security Boyers, Pennsylvania facility, combined with the skill of our staff were key contributing factors to winning the deal. This is just the beginning of our work to aid in the delivery of medical records to enhance patient care of veterans.  Also in Digital Solutions, we had a key win with an existing customer His Majesty's Courts and tribunal service on a digital mailroom solution to automate the indexing and classification elements of the mail room function. The service, which will reduce the cost and time of processing court applications will be delivered from our location where we have a well-established digitization and BPO facility.  Turning to asset lifecycle management, or ALM, we divide this business into 3 verticals. The first of these is the hyperscale decommissioning business that we acquired from ITRenew. Our volumes grew in excess of 30% in this vertical year-over-year, reflecting our market-leading platform, the strength of our existing customer relationships and our ability to win more new logos. Revenue is down, however, reflecting the record-low pricing the market has seen since the end of 2022 on both new and used components.  In our enterprise ITAD vertical, we've been gratified to see more synergies with our existing customers. Since we have relationships with over 225,000 customers across our wider business, the opportunity to cross-sell our enterprise ITAD services has never been greater.  The last of these verticals is the technology manufacturers. Here, we are winning business, both in terms of servers as well as end-user devices. We have invested in our sales force and obtained specific expertise in the OEM space setting us up for success. This indirect relationship to decommission end-user product is a huge market opportunity. Examples of recent wins in the ALM business include a contract with an existing global asset management company to perform on-site hard disk and solid state disk ratio and destruction whilst maximizing value from data center and corporate end-user assets.  Continuing with ALM, a large global risk management company sought services to decommission to complete in 2 partial data centers. A combination of our strong existing relationship and performance, including guidance from a dedicated program manager, our remarketing solutions and capabilities and the ease of the use of our ALM portal contributed to the win.  Finally, let's turn to our Data Center business. We are pleased to have finished the first quarter of 2023 with 52 megawatts of new leases signed with a single hyperscale customer signing 2 deals for a total of 44 megawatts. You will recall that our guidance for the year is 80-plus megawatts. So to have least over half of our target in the first quarter alone is a triumph of our team.  In terms of the co-location wins this past quarter, one win I would like to highlight is with an existing U.S. federal home loan customer who sought to expand into a new data center market for disaster recovery options and selected our VA2 data center in Manassas, Virginia. The customer was impressed with the tour of our Virginia campus and the custom solution we developed to meet their needs. With their positive past experience with our data center services, we've bundled this expanded solution with a renewal at another of our data center sites.  Also in the quarter, our team announced the win with a fleet management company, which for years has explored moving their internal on-site data center infrastructure to co-location. Our ability to provide a custom solution in our VA2 data center, including direct internet access, smart hands and cross connects resulted in a powerful solution for them and the continuation of an important relationship that has the potential to expand to a disaster recovery solution at our New Jersey data center.  Also noteworthy is a substantial win with an existing major semiconductor chip manufacturer who's taking advantage of all the Mountain range has to offer. The customer was seeking a data center partner to host their internal development cloud environment, and our data center and commercial sales teams work closely to deliver a solution at our Arizona site, leveraging the customer's existing relationship.  All 3 of these wins that I have noted are with long-standing customers, demonstrating our ability to source premium co-location deals with customers with whom we have had trusted relationships for decades. To conclude, we are more enthusiastic than ever about the growth in our business and our ability to offer our customers expanded and innovative solutions to meet their ever-evolving needs. Project Matterhorn is bearing fruit, and we continue to make great strides as our team climbs towards the highest peaks of our journey.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the first quarter, our team continued to deliver strong performance, exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. We achieved an all-time record quarterly revenue of $1.31 billion, representing 5% growth on a reported basis. Organically, revenue grew 7.5%. Revenue was ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call as Global RIM and our data center businesses both outperformed. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue growth of 11%. This marks an acceleration both sequentially and year-on-year. This reflects strong contributions from revenue management, data center commencements and positive volume trends. Total service revenue increased 2% to $504 million or 4% on a constant currency basis. Consistent with the commentary we shared on our last call, the year-on-year impact from the start of the more intense lockdowns in China impacted our ITRenew business.  Excluding ITRenew, service revenue was up 11% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $461 million, a new first quarter record. This represents growth of 7% year-on-year and 9% on a constant currency basis driven by revenue management and strong contributions from data center. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.1%, an improvement of 60 basis points year-on-year with revenue management and mix being the key drivers.  AFFO was $284 million or $0.97 on a per share basis, up $20 million and $0.06, respectively from the first quarter of last year. This was well ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call, partially the result of the timing of some maintenance CapEx items between the first and second quarters.  Now turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.13 billion, an increase of $78 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 11%. Organic storage rental revenue growth of 9.4% reflects our focus on revenue management and solid volume trends. We reported organic service revenue growth of 13.6%, with that performance driven by digital solutions and core offerings.  Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $478 million, an increase of $29 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business. We achieved revenue of $112 million, an increase of $15 million year-on-year. From a total revenue perspective, we delivered 17% growth on an organic basis. Organic storage revenue growth was particularly strong at 24%, driven by commencements and improved pricing. As we projected, data center services were down year-on-year given the fit-out work we were performing in the first half of last year. Data center adjusted EBITDA was $51 million, representing 21% growth.  Turning to new and expansion leasing. We had a very strong quarter with the team signing 52 megawatts. We expanded our relationship with a long-standing customer with a 40-megawatt contract. Later in the quarter, we extended this relationship further with another 4 megawatts. Both of these have an initial term of 7 years with multiple renewal options. We signed new deals across our portfolio with key wins in Scottsdale, Phoenix, Frankfurt and London. In total, we signed 22 new logos within our data center business with strong cross-selling activity.  Turning to asset lifecycle management. In the first quarter, ALM volume was ahead of our expectations, while component pricing was down significantly year-on-year. Importantly, we are now seeing pricing for components stabilizing. Given the current environment that Bill described, we are planning for ALM revenue to be consistent in the second quarter with the first quarter. And with the pipeline activity we are seeing, we are well positioned for improving trends in the back half of the year, driven by volume and new bookings.  In particular, our OEM business is developing well with the team growing our pipeline and delivering key new wins. For example, we recently signed a deal with one of the largest technology end-user device manufacturers to partner with them in the decommissioning needs of their customers.  Turning to capital. In the first quarter, we invested $302 million, of which $274 million was growth and $28 million was recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1x, reflecting a significant improvement from last year, this marks our lowest leverage level since 2017. We expect to operate within our target leverage range, which is 4.5 to 5.5x.  Our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early July. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 64%, settling into our long-term target range of low to mid-60s percent. Now turning to our outlook.  With strong performance in the quarter, we are well on track for the year, and we are pleased to reiterate our full year guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenue of approximately $1.35 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $475 million, AFFO of approximately $270 million and AFFO per share of approximately $0.92. In summary, our team is executing well on our Matterhorn growth initiatives. We are investing in our business. We remain focused on driving increased levels of cross-selling and exceeding the expectations of our customers.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their continued dedication and commitment to Iron Mountain and our customers.  With that, operator, would you please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Organic revenue growth for the services businesses decelerated to 2% in the quarter. Can you elaborate on the factors behind the deceleration in services organic revenue growth? And discuss initiatives or factors that could drive a re-acceleration in growth in the coming quarters?
William Meaney: George, thanks for the question. So yes, I think overall, if you think about it in the traditional areas, our service revenue growth was quite strong. If you look at just in the RIM business is our Global Organic RIM services grew at 14%, again on an organic and constant currency basis. So very, very strong growth. If you look it on the ALM side, which is where you see the downdraft is, as I've said in my comments, is volume in this quarter was up some 30% year-over-year. So we're actually seeing the synergies -- the commercial synergies that we have as a company and as Barry mentioned, we just signed a new OEM customer as well.  So we see really good traction on the volume side. But on the pricing side, if you probably have seen in the electronics industry, some of the components are down 70%. So whilst we still have positive gross margins on that business, is the revenue is heavily impacted by what we've been seeing across the semiconductor industry in terms of record-low pricing.  So I think that it's really a two world. So as I say, from a -- even ALM business on a volume basis has shown traction, but it is a downdraft in terms of the overall service revenue. But the traditional areas, I would say, in terms of RIM, also, if we look at our digital services, we're also up year-over-year in the high teens, really good progression.
Barry Hytinen: Yes, George, it's Barry. Thanks again for the question. The only thing I would -- only a couple of things I would add is I think the team, to Bill's point on our Global RIM is doing phenomenally well. And I think that's the way I would point you to look at the services because, of course, the ALM business is masking our total growth there in terms of what's happening with respect to the core. And at that 14% growth rate that Bill spoke about, that is up against some really big comps. So it's -- I mean, it's a very strong performance, and it is driven by the point that he made, the digital solutions as well as other core offerings, which are all growing for us.  The other thing I'd kind of call out is it's a small factor, but as you know, we were doing fit-out services in data center in the first half of last year. We completed that in the second quarter. And so that makes the year-on-year comp hard just as we explained it would be. So that is another factor that's weighing on that services total growth rate that you were pointing to. I think as you move through and get into the -- see us getting into the back half, you'll see that growth rate accelerating meaningfully as we get beyond the challenges with respect to ALM and the pipeline that Bill was speaking about really comes to fruition and then we also get beyond that data center services comp in the first two quarters. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh: Congratulations on the momentum. Barry, it looks like typically, and I'm just going off the last 2 years, so maybe it's not fair, you can help me with this. But the sequential EBITDA lift in the last 2 years have been $24 million to $25 million, it looks like the Q2 is going to be about $14 million. So when we think about puts and takes in the back half of the year, is that more project benefit from Matterhorn that allows you to reaffirm the EBITDA guidance? Is it better pricing? Maybe just help us understand the seasonality a little bit if I'm thinking about that right.
Barry Hytinen: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Appreciate the question. We feel very good about where we're trending. In fact, the first quarter came in right in line, if not a little bit better than what we were expecting in our guidance for the second quarter is similarly and that is despite the fact that we've adjusted our expectations for ALM down some in the second quarter. And the reason we're able to achieve the numbers that we're putting up in the second -- that we're projecting for the second quarter and our confidence in the back half is because of a couple of things you just pointed out.  We are seeing even better revenue management projections in the business. We have, as you've seen in our Global RIM business, we have very strong storage rental growth on an organic basis, almost 9.5%, which marked an acceleration sequentially and year-on-year. Our total organic storage rental growth was over 11%, which was also very strong.  And I will tell you that in light of the fact that we are going to see more revenue management activities we've recently passed some here even in the second quarter, and we'll be passing more as we move through the year, together with the fact that data center pricing continues to improve, and that's an industry phenomenon. You will see, together with that, our commencements are very strong in the back half. So data center will be accelerating as we get into the back half. And as you know, there's very strong visibility on that business. So it's a high confidence point that I'm making there.  So we feel very good about where we are. In terms of -- you mentioned the specifics around second versus the -- quarter versus second half. I'll just note that in light of the timing of the U.S. dollar strength, we still have an FX headwind in the second quarter. In the first quarter, that was almost $30 million of topline. But as we said on the last call, and I'll reiterate, that becomes much more muted, in fact, may even be a slight tailwind in the back half.  We also get through a few items that are in the first half from an EBITDA standpoint. As you know, we did some sale leasebacks last year and we comp over those as we move into the back half and with our productivity initiatives and additional commercial investments we've made, we get to a more favorable comp in the back half from those as well.  So I'll tell you, Kevin, we feel very well positioned about accelerating business even with more muted expectations around ALM.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Jonathan Atkin: Towards the beginning, you pointed out a number of wins with government agencies and large enterprises and so forth. And I was curious to maybe get a little bit more color on what's kind of the tone of discussion around sales cycle compared to what you're accustomed to? And then the competitive set that you faced with those deals to the extent that you faced with these bake-offs or just kind of the decision to go with you is really more of a bilateral discussion, but maybe a little bit about the competitive dynamics and sales cycle would be helpful for both government and enterprise?
William Meaney: Okay. Well, thanks, Jon, for the question. So the -- and I was actually involved in a couple of these, so I could probably give you more color on them. The sales cycles, for instance, the aerospace company that we talked about was like over a year, but this is a company that we've been doing bits of work for decades, right? So it's a natural conversation that they start talking about, well, they want to actually do something different. And this speaks of case, they actually had an in-house vendor for part of it but that company wasn't able to do the full range of services. As I said, they were looking for someone to really takeover of full outsourcing and they're very sensitive, right? Because if one of these things goes missing, aircraft around the world get grounded. So they were very, very sensitive about the security and the reliability of their vendor.  And then the other side of it, obviously, they've known us for decades in different areas that are very sensitive to them. And we were able to bring a full range of services that we're able to do, not just the storage, not just the digitization, but also to give them the tools that they could visualize what was both stored physically and what was digitized and they could do that in a consolidated basis. In other words, they could do that and see that anywhere in the world.  So that was a huge win for them. Now you can say the sales cycle was like over a year. I think I've been visiting with the sales team at customer for over a year but it's been part of an ongoing conversation, and that's the power of having the 225,000 customers that we've had decades and decades of relationship.  The government one, which I mentioned, which -- 2 of them, one was in the U.K. and one was in the -- with the United States government. For the folks that have been following the company for quite some time, we've been talking about the government sector as being our huge potential for Iron Mountain. And it was slow-going at the beginning because government contracts, as I'm sure you're aware, have very long lead times. But both of those have been customers that we've actually been working for the last 2 or 3 years with -- so again, we were -- there was a big investment, I would say, starting 5, 6 years ago with both the VA and with the British government in certain segments. But that's again now starting to become more of a normal course.  So one level is the conversation started 5 years ago, but now it's just a regular course of business that some of these things are as short as 3 or 4 months' lead time where they come up with a statement of work and because we already have a track record, and we're able to do that.
Operator: Next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Barry, you alluded a few times on the call to good revenue management and improving revenue management. Can you talk a little bit about what the pricing lift in the quarter was and what investors should expect for 2023? And you guys had very good revenue management last year. Is the revenue management straight out being able to raise prices now? Or is there some kind of favorable mix going on? Maybe you could just give a little more color there.
Barry Hytinen: Okay. So thanks for that question. I think our team is doing a phenomenal job with revenue management. It's been a real standout. When you look at Global RIM in terms of its storage rental organic growth that was almost 9.5%. And as you know, we saw good solid volume trends. It was up about $2.5 million on a cube on a trailing 12-month basis.  So as you can gather from that, the vast majority of the growth was driven by revenue management. And importantly, we feel very well positioned in terms of the whole year. And I'll tell you that in terms of the total storage rental growth rate that we put up 11%, which is, of course, benefited by data center commencements with what we see on data center commencements through the remainder of the year.  Together with the revenue management activities we've already put in place and additional that we have going into market over the next few months, I feel very confident that we are going to continue to see total company organic storage rental growth of this order, I think, 9%, 10%, 11%.  And that the environment for revenue management continues to be strong. We will have relatively more revenue management this year, Shlomo, than we did last year. And that is a factor of both what we're wrapping from last year as well as the activities we've had in this year.  Importantly, we continue to see excellent customer retention, and I think that just demonstrates that we are bringing forward very significant value for our clients in these areas. In terms of mix, I would say we continue, as we talked about before, to expand the revenue management program beyond just storage. So you are seeing improving revenue management trends in our services, and that's generally across all line service in our core offerings and so we feel like it's on the right trajectory, Shlomo.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP Paribas.
Unidentified Analyst: This is . Maybe you can just remind us on the funding plan for development this year? What does the pricing look like for any debt needed? Would you do asset or company level financing? And then I also wanted your updated thoughts on the dividend here with the payout, the lowest it's been in a while.
William Meaney: I appreciate the question. Let me take your last question on the dividend, and then I'll let Barry comment on the funding plan. And as you know, our plan from -- when we talked about Investor Day, it's a fully funded plan, but I'll let Barry comment on that more.  On the dividend, you're right to point out is we are now in that zone when we said kind of low to mid 60% payout ratio, which becomes a natural forcing function for increasing our dividend. So that's something that we're now starting to settle into that range. So you can expect that it will just become a natural course of events as we get to that payout range, which on the REIT guidance rules just force as a natural increase in the dividend. So I think we're now in that area. So I think when we start getting into the back half of the year, and we start drifting down to the low 60s, then I think you can expect just a natural progression in the dividend.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks for the question. When you work through our guidance, as Bill mentioned, as we discussed at the Investor Day, we have a fully funded plan for this year and going forward. And as you know, we will be a routine debt issuer, and while the market has clearly been moved up in terms of rate over the last couple of years with the Fed moves, I would say it's become much more -- it's an improved market as compared to where it was over the last couple of quarters, and we see generally a favorable outlook from a standpoint of issuance. And I think from a standpoint of where we could issue today, that's improved some versus the last couple of quarters.  And to your point, there's a lot of interest in asset-level financing, whether it be for construction or otherwise. And so we're looking at all those options and making sure that we have the best plan for our shareholders. But it's not something that we have to do, as you see, we have plenty of liquidity, but you should expect us to be an issuer on a routine basis. I want to just kind of continue to see what's out there from a market perspective. Clearly, rates are a little bit higher than where they were a couple of years ago, but we still see them being very attractive and partly because pricing in data center has continued to lift and we see continued improvements.  In fact, year-on-year, net new retail-type data center deals we're seeing up like 20%, pretty much consistently across our entire portfolio, and that's trending more toward, I think, by the end of the year, early next year going to be about like 30%. And so that is a pretty significant move.  And then importantly, on hyperscale side, I think the whole industry is generally seeing cash-on-cash unlevered returns moving up, I think something like where a lot of folks were writing in the high 7s or mid-7s, I'm seeing a lot of stuff that's in the 8s, if not even higher. And so I think that's a good trajectory for the industry. It's healthy and it supports the point that I was making earlier. So we feel really good.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Alex Hess: This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. I wanted to ask briefly about the ITRenew callout. You highlighted that services revenue growth would have been 11% organic, excluding ITRenew, which implies a pretty sharp deterioration quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year in that business, if my math is right. Could you maybe break that out into what degree that was driven by pricing versus ability to sell through into end markets? And any other dynamics that sort of give you confidence that, that will eventually recover?
William Meaney: Thanks Hess for the question. I'll start, and then I'll ask Barry to comment and really kind of talk about how we see that trending as we go forward into the year. So as I said in my comments, actually, if we just looked at volume holding pricing constant, is, quite frankly, Q1 would have been a great year for the ITRenew asset that we acquired because the ITRenew, as you know, was really focused at hyperscale. And if we look at that segment alone, I mean, we made very good progress in terms of expanding across our customer portfolio on the enterprise.  But if we just look at hyperscale, which is the ITRenew asset is volume was up 30-plus percent year-over-year. So the volume growth was really good. However -- and I'm sure you're probably seeing this in some of the other companies that you follow, anything that touches the electronics industry when you start seeing what's happened to the chip manufacturers, the memory manufacturers, et cetera, is the pricing has gone down substantially in that area. So we're talking about for a number of components down over 70%.  So you're right to point out, if we look at sequentially Q4 to Q1 is we have seen a drop of revenue on the ITRenew portion of the business or the hyperscale portion of the business even absent -- even -- in spite of the fact that volumes are up 30% year-over-year. So now the good news is that we do see stabilization on those prices, and we see a number of the memory manufacturers and the chip manufacturers, CPU manufacturers, we see them taking capacity out of the market, which gives us further confidence that we've seen kind of a stabilization of prices, which we've seen, I would say, starting towards the end of February going into March.  So we don't see right now that the prices are going to go down further. So that's the good news. But we don't expect that the -- I would say, the chip/memory CPU market is really going to start firming up until we get into the early parts of next year. But Barry?
Barry Hytinen: Alex, I appreciate the question. I'll give you a little bit more of the detail, which you could find in our filings. So in the fourth quarter of last year, our total ALM business was about $56 million. And in the first quarter, it was $41 million. And so -- and that compares against $70 million last year. Now as I talked about previously, the second quarter of last year was in light of the timing of lockdowns and the pricing trends by the end of the year, second quarter was the peak for our ALM business at $83 million of revenue. We've assumed in our guidance for the second quarter that revenue is consistent with the first quarter this year. So that is a drag on, of course, the services growth rate in the first quarter, and it will be again in the second quarter.  At the -- if you wanted to sort of sensitize our guidance, I would tell you at the low end of our range, which I did not anticipate this is what's going to happen, but just at the low end, we would assume that it just is flat at this level of revenue for the whole year. I really don't see that happening in light of the very strong pipeline opportunities we have in the trends we're seeing in the business. But that's conservative posture for the low end.  What we think is probably going to happen is we will be slight to -- slightly up sequentially. We're running a little bit ahead here already in the second quarter of the projection I'm giving you. And then in the second half, the way we're planning is for the third quarter to be essentially flat year-on-year. So that implies a little bit of a lift and another lift in the fourth quarter. But I will tell you that we have pretty strong confidence in our ability to do that. And I called out 1 deal on -- in the prepared remarks around OEM, and maybe I'll give you a little bit more color. This is a situation where we're dealing with one of the largest manufacturers of devices in the world.  There are several of those, as you know, and we're approaching all of them because what we're finding with large multinationals is very similar to our core enterprise clients. These companies are looking for a partner who can work with them everywhere they do business all around the world. They're currently using a lot of point players in very specific markets on a local basis, and they'd like to have more uniform standards and consistency, and we can provide them with the sorts of services they're looking for things like data [indiscernible], recycling, remarketing. Ultimately, we'll be working with them on things like asset tracking and storage, IT asset management, things of that nature.  So it's -- another example of how our team is continuing to diversify and grow our ALM business and it bolsters our confidence. And just to reiterate, this is a huge market ALM. We really like the space. It's very fragmented, and we think we're in a very good position to take a tremendous amount of share over time. We're working through what everyone in the industry is working through right now, which is pretty low component pricing. We feel good about the opportunity.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.
Eric Luebchow: So I wanted to touch on the data center demand. So you're more than 60% towards your leasing goal for the full year, so a really strong start to the year. And if you look -- it looks like your in-place and development portfolios are pretty highly leased up. So maybe you could talk about your ability to accommodate additional demand, whether through future development of your land holdings, additional expansions? And then if leasing continues to trend at a high level, could you accelerate some of your data center CapEx this year beyond what you initially guided to?
William Meaney: Thanks, Eric. And I'll ask Barry to talk about how we think about being flexible or responsive on the CapEx side. But I think generally, yes, we've had a really good start, as you point out the year. We reiterated the 80 megawatts plus for the full year, even though that we've achieved more than half of that in the first quarter because I think as you can appreciate, especially with hyperscale, there's a little bit -- the timing is never fully under your control.  So I would say that we -- some of that -- the new leases that we signed in Q1 were things that we expected in Q2. So I kind of think of it as 2 halves of the year rather than quarter by quarter, just especially when you're talking about hyperscale clients and we had 1 hyperscale client in Q1 that signed up in 2 different contracts for 44 megawatts. In terms of having enough capacity for further expansion, you see we're holding like up to 747 megawatts of land, which is a big uptick from where we were a year ago, but we are making really good progress. So we're constantly -- we're not standing still in that regard.  I mean just in the last couple of months, I visited both our Northern Virginia campus with a potential customer and now done 2 trips with our Indian team since the beginning of the year. So both of those markets continue to develop. And we're not standing still in making sure that we have more land and more capacity to meet our growth. But if you think about just year-on-year, the uptick that we have in terms of the land bank that we have and sitting on 747 megawatts is that we feel good for the next number of quarters that we can accommodate the demand. But Barry, you might want to talk about how we think about the flexibility around CapEx.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Eric. It's good to talk to you this morning. I appreciate those kind words. We -- obviously, the team is doing really well and continuing strength and strength in terms of new signings and also margin performance in our data center business. So hats off to our team there. In terms of data center capital, as you know, this year, we had penciled to deploy about $850 million of growth CapEx and with the vast majority of that going to data center. Year-on-year, we put a considerable incremental amount of CapEx into data center in the first quarter. I think we do have the benefit of so much being pre-leased and the team continue to sell that, yes, it is conceivable to me that we will be, over time, ramping our CapEx for data center and it's sort of a bit of a high-class problem, so to speak, as the team continues to sell through our pipeline plans.  So we have ample capacity to do so in terms of deploying additional capital. We were always planning to spend from a timing standpoint, more CapEx, relatively speaking, in the first half this year than we did last year. As you recall, last year, it was a little bit more shaped towards the back half in terms of data center deployment where deploying a considerable amount here in the first half, we'll continue that trend in the second quarter. And after we get through midyear and see how the additional pipeline looks, which is quite strong, I'll note, at this time.  As we see how that is at midyear, we may talk to you about a little bit more, but that would be a very positive development in terms of continuing to see really high levels of organic growth rates driven by commencements. As you know, we're very pre-leased in terms of our underdevelopment. I think we're now pressing over 90% in terms of pre-leased in terms of what's under construction. So it's a good place to be.  The only other thing I guess I'll call out is that churn has been relatively low, and we continue to expect it to be relatively low for the full year. So thank you, Eric, for your questions.
Operator: Next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays.
Brendan Lynch: I wanted to discuss a little bit about Project Matterhorn. I understand it's still very early days, but you called out some large multiple vertical wins. I'm wondering how you expect that type of contract to trend in your revenue mix over the long term as Project Matterhorn gains more momentum. Do you expect to see a lot more of these large multi-vertical wins relative to kind of the legacy revenue mix, which might have been more of a fragmented customer base?
William Meaney: No. Thanks, Brendan. It really is -- first and foremost, Project Matterhorn has being customer-centric. So what we try to do is make sure we bring full range of Mountain range of services that we have to, to our customers. And if you probably got picked up on a sense is there is a big service component in some of these wins, especially around the digital side. But it's also a big co-location and physical storage. So it's almost -- if you think about even the aerospace company that I've referenced a couple of times in the Q&A and also in my remarks, is there is everything from physical storage to digitization to visualization of their assets. So there is a -- it's a full breadth of the different types of storage solutions we have.  But I think you can expect like and even if you look at our physical -- our organic storage rental revenue growth of 11%, a part of that is, as we said, 9.5% of that growth rate came from our traditionalized physical storage business a bit, but a big part of that came from our data center growth as well. So we see kind of a -- we still see storage. It's one of the most profitable part of our business. We still see that whether it's data center storage or physical document storage and other types of physical storage driving a big part of the growth of the business. But when we actually go talk to a customer, and it's really about helping the customers solve their problem, then it's usually a hybrid set of solutions, which quite frankly, differentiates us when -- even on a data center deal or a physical storage deal.  They really see Iron Mountain as someone that can be a one-stop shopper relatively few stops to actually solve the problem that they're trying to solve rather than what we're trying to sell.
Barry Hytinen: Brendan, I'll just add, as we talked about before, one of our key initiatives within Matterhorn is cross-selling. And if you go back to what I mentioned in the prepared remarks and our data center team signed 22 new logos within data center in the quarter and when we segment that on a megawatt basis, 75% of that was cross-sell from our existing client base, those 225,000 clients. So I think that's a good indicator of what we are trying to drive with our Matterhorn initiatives around cross-selling.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Bill, I thought you had missed it if I don't ask you about the underlying volumes in RIM. So I'm going to ask you now if you can provide a little bit of more color on the breakout like RIM adjacent businesses, consumer and other, just how are the underlying factors playing out and maybe talk a little bit about developed markets versus emerging markets as well?
William Meaney: Thanks, I appreciate you coming back on. So no, so it's pretty much the same trend that we've seen. So if you think about on the record business on that side is in places like North America that are mature, I would say, it's flat to slightly down in terms of volume. Eastern Europe and some of the emerging markets, it's continued positive volume trend. And as you and I've talked about, it's really about the maturing of the markets. But at the same time, every single customer around the world is continuing to send us new, what I would call, document storage as we come into our facilities. But the growth areas, our combination is, as we've discussed before, is whether it's kind of in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific as well as some of the new storage areas that we're doing for our customers. So expanding what their needs are around physical storage.  So the business, as you noticed, is that -- continue to build positive volume. We continue to have very high utilization across our industrial real estate footprint. So really hats off to the team as they're continuing to provide what is a key platform or a key need for our customers around the whole physical storage pain point that our customers have across the industry. Even the aerospace company that I keep referring to is a big part of that, was providing secure physical storage, which before we weren't doing for them, but because we bundled it with a solution of really end-to-end solution around their information management and digitization of some of those assets, and we can do that seamlessly by storing those documents in our facilities for them. Even in a mature market like the United Kingdom had unlocked new storage opportunities.  So it's really part of now a broader conversation of the Mountain range that we have with our customers. And you can see the numbers, it continues to kind of move forward. So thanks for the question.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session in the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-23 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Iron Mountain Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Gillian Tiltman: Thanks Sarah. Good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On today’s call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meany, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we’ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today’s earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today’s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2, and our annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Bill.
William Meany: Thank you, Julian. And thank you all for taking the time to join us today. We are pleased to have delivered record performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. These exceptional results are reflective of our broad product portfolio, synergistic business model, deep customer relationships, and committed team. Before I dive into the drivers of our strong performance, I would like to take a few moments to relay how deeply saddened we are all feeling by the devastating and recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. Our thoughts and prayers are with our fellow mountaineers, customers and all of their families living and working in the region. The safety and security of our employees is our number one priority. And we are committed to supporting our colleagues in the region as they navigate this challenging time. Now let me begin our discussion of our recent performance. I am proud to report that Iron Mountain has had another outstanding year. In the fourth quarter we achieved quarterly revenue of $1.28 billion yielding 11.3% total organic revenue growth and record adjusted EBITDA $472 million up 10%. For the full year, we delivered record results across the board. Revenue of $5.1 billion adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion, and AFFO of $1.1 billion, representing growth of 14% 12% and 10%, respectively. This performance is a direct result of our close relationships with our customers and our commitment to innovation so we can provide them with expanded products and services to meet their needs. For the full year, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 9%, reflecting continued benefit of pricing combined with positive volume trends. We drove double digit organic growth in our data center business, as well as our digital services and asset lifecycle management business areas capping off another excellent year. Our continued drive to build an ever-expanding suite of synergistic and customer centric solutions, together with global reach and scale fuels our accelerated growth consistent with the Matterhorn Excellence model we unveiled last autumn. Let me share a few examples of how we've been enabling our customer’s success and growth through the diverse solutions and unmatched customer service we offer. Beginning with our records management business report, we reported a substantial cross sell win with a large non-profit healthcare provider, which has been an Iron Mountain customer for more than 20 years. The win resulted in a new 10-year contract covering records management, ALM, data management, secure storage of non-records and document digitization services taking this customer from $2.5 million per year to $5 million annually. Just a few years ago, we would have been able unable to provide such a broad range of services and solutions to this long tenured customer. Today, with our broad offerings we not only cross sold the new services and solutions, but we increased our share of wallet for our records management services and solidified our position as a trusted and strategic partner. We also provided a solution for a large U.S. Bank to develop a simple and cost effective process to manage its vast inventory of over 24 million mortgage files. This partnership involves meeting stringent compliance obligations, mitigating risk and reducing cost. Also in the quarter we want new business serving the Australian Government. Through this work, we will drive considerable cost savings to one of Australia's largest government agencies. Iron Mountain will have a dedicated team to pack, enter data and transport 375,000 cartons to our new facility in Melbourne. In Digital Solutions, a key win I would like to highlight is with a branch of the U.S. federal government. As a result of the enormous success of our original project with the customer to digitize 177,000 reels of microfilm in less than the prescribed year, we have executed a sole source follow on contract to digitize another 133,000 reels of microfilm. This win is the result of the strategic development of a best-in-breed AI machine learning solution to auto classify and automate data capture. In addition, we worked with a large global medical equipment and electronics manufacturer to navigate an extensive global medical product recall. The customer needed an efficient partner to assist with the recall in order to meet regulatory requirements and avoid further legal ramifications. The customer also required rapid response and tight turnaround times and was seeking a single partner. The win includes several service offerings delivered by a single point of contact and illustrates the early success of our new commercial operating model that we introduced with Project Matterhorn. Turning to ALM, another noteworthy win this quarter was with a health insurance provider, which selected Iron Mountain as its dedicated asset lifecycle management partner. Due to the unique nature of their business, the customer has constant attrition throughout the course of the year, and consequently, they were seeking a dedicated ALM partner to provide collection, wiping, imaging, secure storage and redeployment of technology assets. The customers previous positive experience with Iron Mountain and our team, combined with our strong solutions led to mutual success. Our services resolve the challenges around collection, ease of use, and reporting and tracking. This illustrates our commercial team strength and ability to cross sell our set of solutions across the mountain range. And is another example of our increased focus and success in driving commercial engagement is part of our Matterhorn Klein. Moreover, we are especially proud to say that we renewed our largest ALM contract this quarter. This is the fourth contract renewal with this client, one of the largest technology companies in the world. We have worked with them for the past 12 years and are proud of this relationship, the continuation of which demonstrates the potential for longevity in this area of our business. We continue to be excited and encouraged by the total addressable market in the asset lifecycle management category. Despite the headwinds we have faced this year as a result of enduring COVID-19 lockdowns in China. In spite of this, our legacy ITAD business continues to perform well and as we gain momentum on our Matterhorn Klein, we continue to focus on moves to accelerate this growth. Finally, turning to our data center business, we are pleased to have finished the year with 139 megawatts of new leases signed exceeding our original booking guidance of 50 megawatts and our most recent target expressed in the third quarter of 130 megawatts. In the fourth quarter, we successfully completed 14 megawatts of leasing. This area of our business has gone from strength to strength over the past several years, and we continue to see tremendous opportunity in serving both hyperscale and colocation customers, and significant growth potential for our data center footprint. With 37% year-on-year bookings growth, excluding our large lease in Virginia 4, 5 we will continue to prioritize data centers with our capital program, more details of which Barry will provide in his remarks. One customer win in our data center business that I would like to share is a six megawatt expansion lease at our Phoenix campus with an existing Global Fortune 100 customer. The customer which has a long-term strategic relationship with Iron Mountain across service lines, and has existing capacity in several of our other locations needed space to expand in Arizona. Our customer was able to leverage our Phoenix data center for their expansion, and we look forward to supporting them in their future growth. Also in the quarter, our team announced a win for our joint venture at the Mumbai-2 data center, which is connected to our Mumbai-1 data center one of the most robust carrier hotels in the country, providing superb connectivity and flexibility for our customers. We partnered with a global content delivery network company to expand their presence in Mumbai. They required a robust network ecosystem backed by reliable power infrastructure, which we were able to provide. Another win to highlight our ability to cross sell across business segments involves our existing relationship with one of the largest German banks. This resulted in a new partnership with our data center team who leveraged their excellent network within the German Financial Network market and demonstrated proficiency and its high regulatory standards, customer buying team structures and the data center competition in Frankfurt. The customers felt confident in our team's expertise in our ability to support a highly regulated environment to meet their needs. This is yet another excellent example of our ability to listen to our customers and find ways to meet their needs. To conclude, I am incredibly proud of our dedicated team, our unmatched customer dedication and relationships and our solutions, which continue to drive our transformation and excellence. The reorganization we completed in 2022 through the initiation of Matterhorn has established a strong foundation, which is already delivering double-digit growth. It is this foundation built by Matterhorn, which will continue to fuel our growth trajectory and to realize our greatest ambitions. Turning toward 2023, this momentum will continue to drive the opportunities ahead with another year double-digit top line growth expected. Barry will speak in detail about our guidance for the year ahead. Our goals are well within sight as we climb on with Project Matterhorn and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks Bill. And thank you all for joining us today to discuss our results. Before I begin, I would like to echo Bill sentiments with regard to the tragedy of the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. Turning to our financials in the fourth quarter, our team continued the trend of delivering strong performance exceeding expectations for both adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.28 billion grew 10.3% year-on-year or 14.2% excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Total organic revenue grew 11.3%. Revenue was in line with the expectations we shared when we reported the third quarter in November. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 11% and represents a sequential improvement of 130 basis points. Total service revenue increased 17% to $510 million driven by organic growth of 12%. These results reflect the strong performance of our commercial team and their focus on selling the entire mountain range of products and solutions. Adjusted EBITDA was $472 million in new record up 10% on a reported basis and up 13% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As compared to the rates we were using at the time of our last guidance, the dollar strengthened in November, which resulted in an incremental headwind in the fourth quarter of several million dollars to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected at 36.9% and improved 40 basis points sequentially driven by revenue management and mix. AFFO was $287 million, or $0.98 on a per share basis of $20 million and $0.06 respectively from the fourth quarter of last year. This was well ahead of our projections, partially due to the timing of a nearly $10 million cash tax item, which is now incorporated into our 2023 guidance. Now, let me briefly summarize the full year. Revenue of $5.1 billion increased 14% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% year-on-year to $1.827 billion, an increase of $192 million year-on-year, exceeding the projections given on our last call. AFFO increased 10% to $1.11 billion, or $3.80 on a per share basis. I would like to briefly compare our results to our financial guidance. As we have noted throughout the year, FX rates have been more of a headwind than we had initially planned. In fact, using the same FX rates we had in our projections in February of 2022, we would have exceeded the high end of our guidance for EBITDA AFFO and AFFO per share. Now turning to segment performance. In the fourth quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.08 billion, an increase of $61 million from last year or 6% on a reported basis. This equates to a 10% increase excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 11%. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $486 million, an increase of $39 million year-on-year driven by revenue management. Turning to our global data center business, we are pleased to report another successful quarter. From the total revenue perspective we delivered 15% year-on-year growth on a reported basis and 19% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As a reminder in the second half of 2021, we provided unique fit out services for our Frankfort joint venture. In the fourth quarter of 2021 those services resulted in approximately $9 million of revenue. Excluding those fit out services on a like-for-like basis, our total data center revenue grew in excess of 27%. And we are now back to a more normalized service revenue run rate. Our data center storage revenue grew 25% year-on-year or 28% on a constant currency basis. Turning to new and expansion leasing, we completed 14 megawatts in the fourth quarter, and 139 for the full year. This is well ahead of our updated leasing projection of 130 for the full year. Excluding our large bill to suit lease in Virginia, we leased 67 megawatts for the full year. With our increasing pipeline and the depth of our customer relationships for 2023, we project leasing 80 megawatts or more for the full year. This represents 20% bookings growth. We are continuing to expand our data center platform into new markets. And as we discussed in November, we closed the Madrid data center transaction early in the fourth quarter. Turning to our asset lifecycle management business, we continue to be pleased with the results of our legacy ITAD business which grew approximately 30% for the full year. And we are happy to report that we have seen strong growth in our pipeline. For the hyperscale decommission portion of the business, we are conservatively planning the year with an expectation for continued impact from COVID-19 in China. For example, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we have assumed revenue from our total ALM business is consistent year-on-year. As a reminder, the decommissioning market was performing better through the first half of 2022 and slowed down sharply following more intense lock downs in China. And as we are planning for ramping performance through the year, we anticipate the first quarter of 2023 revenue in our ALM business to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2022. With that, we will naturally have some impact on our organic growth rate in the first two quarters of the year as we anniversary the IT renew transaction in January. Turning to capital, for the full year 2022 we invested $820 million of growth capital and $142 million of recurring. For 2023 we project capital expenditure to be approximately $850 million of growth, with the vast majority of that dedicated to datacenter development and $145 million of recurring. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong adjusted EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.1 times better than our projections and an improvement versus last quarter. I think it is worth noting this marks our lowest leverage levels since 2017. As we have said before, we expect to operate within our target leverage range, which is 4.5 times to 5.5 times. For 2023 we expect to exit the year at similar levels to year end 2022. Our board of directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April. On a trailing four quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 65% approaching our long-term target range of low to mid 60s percent. Now let me share our projections for the full year of 2023. We expect total revenue to be within the range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion, which represents between 8% and 10% growth year-on-year. On consistent FX rates this implies growth of 9% to 11%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within the range of $1.94 billion to $1.975 billion, which represents 7% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. On consistent FX rates, this implies growth of 8% at the midpoint. We expect AFFO to be within the range of $1.15 billion to $1.175 billion, which represents 5% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. On consistent FX rates, this would be 6% growth at the midpoint. We expect AFFO per share to be $3.91 to $4. This represents growth of 4% at the midpoint, and on consistent FX rates this would be 6% growth at the midpoint. Our guidance for both AFFO and AFFO per share includes the timing of the approximate $10 million cash tax item I previously mentioned from the fourth quarter of 2022 into the first quarter of 2023. This represents approximately two points of growth on both metrics. I would like to share some commentary to help investors better understand our guidance. In terms of FX we are using current rates in our projections for 2023. While the U.S. dollar has weakened some recently, we currently expect FX to be nearly a $40 million headwind to revenue for the full year. I would like to further note that at these levels FX will be a more pronounced headwind in the first half of the year. We expect revenue management will continue to be a significant benefit. And I will note the vast majority of the actions we have planned for in 2023 have already been implemented at this point. And turning to the first quarter, we expect revenue in excess of $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $460 million, AFFO of approximately $270 million, and AFFO per share of approximately $0.92. To conclude, we are pleased to have delivered a strong year in 2022 and are realizing our growth ambitions that we outlined at our recent investor day. I'd like to take this opportunity to once again express my thanks to our entire team for their continued dedication, serving our customers and delivering on our collective commitments. And with that operator, will you please open the line for Q&A?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks, good morning. Services organic revenue growth remained in the double digits at 12% year-over-year in 4Q, but decelerated from 22% growth in 3Q. Can you discuss the puts and takes you're seeing with respect to services, organic revenue growth trends?
William Meaney: Yes. No, thanks, George. So first of all, we're very pleased with the continued growth, especially where we just started Matterhorn last year. So if you look at overall in terms of the organic growth through the year and an increase in terms of total revenue growth, as we progress. So we're very pleased. To your specific question on service is one of the biggest factors in terms of when you're looking at the year-over-year comparison, if you recall, a year ago, we had the big fit-out for data center in Frankfurt. So that's the biggest factor in terms of that slight drop or that noticeable drop when you look at the year-over-year, still double-digit growth but that was the biggest factor. I don't know, Barry, if you want to add anything.
Barry Hytinen: Yes George, the only other thing I'd add, I suppose, is that it was right in line with our expectations when we set the projections because, of course, as we signaled last quarter, we obviously knew that we had to anniversary over the fit-out services. So we're very pleased with the way services performed. And I will just tell you that as we look forward, we've got very good pipeline on things like digital solutions, our legacy IT asset disposition business is ramping, and we have as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, very nice pipeline there. And we will see some incremental benefit from revenue management. So we feel very well positioned, George. Thanks for the question.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thanks. So it seems like FX was an incremental headwind as was ITRenew. I don't know if this is for Barry, where were the offsets? Because obviously, the revenue looked pretty good in EBITDA, but just were the offsets on the revenue management or anything else?
Barry Hytinen: Thanks for the question, Kevin. I would say ITRenew actually performed consistent with our expectations, and I'll just provide a little more color there. As we've said before, with the lockdowns that we were experiencing or everyone is experiencing in China, we had been seeing ITRenew declining through last year. And in fact, in the fourth quarter, it stabilized was actually slightly up on a sequential basis, which we view as a positive. Now we are, I think, being prudent with our expectations for ITRenew going forward because as you've probably seen in the press, China continues to -- while the restrictions are off, they continue to have a lot of challenges with COVID there. And so we haven't seen the market develop meaningfully yet, but we are cautiously optimistic. So we are planning for the first quarter expectations for our ALM business to be consistent with the fourth quarter revenue levels and then ramping over the course of the year. As it relates to the rest of the business that you were pointing out, we had very strong contribution from revenue management, as you would have seen in the supplemental report. In fact, that ramped nicely on a sequential basis. And we feel very well positioned as it relates to revenue management as we move here through 2023 because as I mentioned in the remarks, all of our revenue management actions are essentially already in market. So we feel very, very good about how things are trending. The other thing I'd call out, which was a really nice performance was in our data center business. You saw the growth rate continue to be very strong on the storage side, high 20s and from a standpoint of bookings also ahead of our expectation. So that gives us very strong visibility into 2023 in terms of revenue generation. And I'll tell you the pipeline continues to build. So appreciate the question. Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrew Steinerman: Hey Barry. Just for the sake of precision, could you just indicate what the organic constant currency revenue growth is at the midpoint of your first quarter and 2023 guide. And it definitely seems like you're expecting faster growth for the full year kind of after first quarter or maybe compared to first quarter and just maybe go over that dynamic more unless you feel like you've already addressed that.
Barry Hytinen: Okay. So a couple of points there for you, Andrew, as it relates to how to think about the first quarter. When I mentioned that we probably have something approaching $40 million of FX challenge for the full year, the vast majority of that is going to be in the first quarter. So I think we'll probably have something like $30-plus million, maybe even more than that of a revenue headwind from FX in the first quarter just based on where rates are now versus last year. The other thing to be thinking about is that from a standpoint of ITRenew, that will go into our organic growth rate this quarter. In fact, as you know, we closed that transaction at the end of last January. And so it's organic for February and March. And last year, I don't mind giving you this number for your modeling purposes, I may have mentioned it last year. ITRenew was about $60 million in the quarter, and then it was $65 million in the second quarter. And since I'm planning it to be essentially consistent on a sequential basis, that's about, call it, $45 million that vicinity. So I think that will have about round numbers, a couple of point impact to organic growth. But from there, if you work through the model, you're going to see organic continue to improve through the year. And really, at that point, you don't have any additional acquisition revenue of any substance in the numbers. So you're essentially very close to the constant currency growth. And I think that at that out of pencil for you on the model.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Adam Parrington: Hi, it's Adam Parrington for Shlomo. What was the pricing lift in the quarter? And what should investors expect for 2023?
Barry Hytinen: Thank you for the question. It was very strong, as you probably noticed. Organic revenue growth on storage was 11%. And overall, it was 11.3%. And so with volume being as we planned just slightly down on a sequential basis, by the way, up better than our projection for the full year. It was a very nice contribution, and we had 8.9% on that metric for the full year. So it shows you the ramp that we've been seeing through the year. In terms of -- for 2023, we continue to expect revenue management to be a very nice contributor and be thinking probably in at least the mid-single digit range for the whole year, if not a little bit higher in light of what we've got in market. And we feel quite good about where things are. And I guess I'll also add that from a volume perspective, since it goes a little bit to the question you were asking, from a volume perspective, we are continuing to see good trends there, and we would expect for the full year 2023 very similar projection to what we did last year. So something like consistent to slightly up. Thank you for the question.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-03 08:30:00) =====

Gillian Tiltman: Thanks Sarah. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On today’s call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We’re joined here today by Bill Meany, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we’ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today’s earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today’s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2, and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Meany: Thank you Gillian, and we appreciate everyone taking the time to join us for our third quarter results.  We are pleased to share with you another outstanding quarter, representing the durability and growth of our business model as we continue to navigate successfully through significant headwinds, including the strength of the U.S. dollar, COVID shutdowns in China, and ongoing global tensions. Our team of 25,000 dedicated Mountaineers continues to empower our customers with solutions to enable them to transform their businesses. In the third quarter on a reported basis, we delivered revenue of $1.29 billion, representing 14% total organic revenue growth. We are pleased to have achieved all time record adjusted EBITDA of $469 million. Since last year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly, and excluding its impact on a like-for-like basis, this quarter our revenue was approximately $1.33 billion and EBITDA was $484 million, representing growth of 18% and 16% respectively. These results demonstrate the inherent growth and strength of our business and are further proof of why we continue to be so encouraged by the increased demand for our services across the markets in which we operate. Positive volume and revenue management trends continued to benefit us this quarter, as reflected in our organic storage rental revenue growth of 9.7%.  As we shared with you in September at our investor event, we are executing well on our new Project Matterhorn operating model, the next transformational phase of Iron Mountain’s growth journey. Building off an already solid foundation, we believe Matterhorn is a cornerstone initiative that will allow us to maintain and capitalize on the positive momentum we have seen over the last several quarters.  Through our fully funded plan’s ability to invest 16% of revenue over the next four years, we believe we will further strengthen Iron Mountain as a market leader across our expanded total addressable market, our diversified global footprint, and our enhanced suite of innovative solutions. Our strong double-digit organic growth is evidence of the early progress we are making on our initiatives, which gives us the momentum and confidence in our ability to deliver higher levels of profitable growth over the next several years.  Now I’d like to share a few highlights of some recent customer wins while lie beneath the top and bottom line growth. Turning to our digital solutions business, we helped a global European bank evolve to a paperless branch experience to drive enhanced customer service with 360-degree customer data, traceable and audible digital records, and reduced manual efforts for their tellers. The customer has a footprint of more than 400 branches in the U.S. with each branch storing decades’ worth of customer records on premises. We are partnering with the bank to digitize all customer records across their U.S. branches in under a year.  The files will be securing transferred and imaged at Iron Mountain digital supercenters indexing and tagged with critical metadata using machine learning and then placed into Insight, Iron Mountain’s digital repository. Insight will be provided to over 3,500 tellers across the bank to access these digitized customer records quickly and securely. This win is just one example of how we are helping our customers evolve their businesses through digitization, resulting in quicker, easier and more secure access to their most important information for years to come. Also in digital solutions, we won a contract with a state court in Brazil from an incumbent provider. To comply with the Brazilian National Council of Justice’s 100% Digital initiative, all state courts are required to convert active lawsuit documents from physical to digital by 2023. As such, they turned to Iron Mountain for help to implement and complete the conversion process within the mandated time frame whilst adhering to specific quality requirements. Whilst this is in and of itself a terrific win, we are currently exploring further opportunities with this customer. Moving to our asset life cycle management segment, I’d like to share an innovative win this quarter. Our strong existing relationships and coordinated efforts led to a large asset life cycle management win to serve 700 locations in the United States and Canada for a large healthcare company. Prior to the deal, the customer had primarily engaged with us through our records business. The first phase of the partnership included retrieval of IT equipment and plans for a forthcoming data center refresh. We expect to process more than 13,000 assets in the first year. Moving onto the impact of COVID shutdowns in China on the ITRenew business, we see continued constraints in the downstream demand for recycled IT components. As a result, we expect to see similar levels of ITRenew sell-through in Q4 as in Q3. With the continued increase of the backlog of components, we remain bullish on the prospects for the business once the situation normalizes.  In our fine arts business, we are pleased to highlight a win with an internationally renowned art museum. The customer turned to our team to assist them with multiple onsite projects related to renovations the museum will undergo throughout a three-year period. Lacking the internal resources to staff these projects, they were seeking a trusted partner to support them providing additional art handling services. By leveraging our experience and successful track record of prior engagements with the customer, we were able to offer a compelling proposal that secured this very exciting initiative. In the quarter, this business grew by 17% year-over-year, which is a reflection of the strong underlying business.  Shifting to the data center business, we are pleased to have booked 7 megawatts of leasing in this quarter, bringing total bookings year-to-date to 125 megawatts. As a result, we expect to exceed our previous projection of 130 megawatts for new leases for the year.  One of the wins this quarter included a cross-sell deal with a large non-profit community health provider that needed to close down their internal data center and establish a disaster recovery site. As a long-term taped backup and records management customer of Iron Mountain, they reached out to their account team, who engaged with our data center team. As a result, the customer signed a co-location contract which included internet services and multiple cross-connects within 45 days. The convenience of having a single provider for all their physical and digital storage needs was a critical selling point in addition to Iron Mountain’s rigorous data center compliance program, which is essential for the customer given the highly regulated market in which they operate. Our team’s flexibility and willingness to collaborate across divisions to customize solutions for our customer provides a superior experience and ultimately is what made us stand out as their partner of choice. From a development perspective, as discussed in September at our investor event, we have continued to build our land bank in key strategic markets to support future growth with several notable expansion deals. As previously announced, we have added buildable capacity in the Phoenix, Arizona market with the purchase of adjacent land to our existing campus. Based on current design plans, the parcel can support 36 megawatts and includes a 56 MVA substation on site. This is an important expansion in this dynamic market as our current campus at 89 megawatts is nearly fully leased and/or committed. We also expanded our footprint in India with the securing of land and power for 20 megawatts of additional capacity in Mumbai. We remain excited about the growth potential in this strategic emerging market both for our data center business, as well for the enterprise as a whole. In total, we currently have 52 megawatts of buildable capacity across five markets in India. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired a data center campus in Madrid, Spain, marking our entry into the Iberian market. The asset is a uniquely scaled data center campus with an existing 3 megawatt building and fully permitted expansion potential of 79 megawatts. We view Madrid as a very important European market as it is poised to capture significant growth from supply-constrained markets. With these additions to our portfolio, our total capacity is now nearly 670 megawatts.  The wins I’ve shared with you today demonstrate the breadth and depth of our business, our focus on customer centricity and providing innovative, transformation solutions, and the strength of our global commercial platform driven by our Matterhorn initiative. I am very proud of our outstanding team who are the bedrock of our company and the way in which we come together to drive and deliver our growth journey. Our business model is highly profitable, our pipeline is strong, our vision is clear, and we continue to climb on. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks Bill, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our results. In the third quarter, our team delivered solid performance, meeting top line projections while exceeding expectations for both EBITDA and AFFO. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.29 billion grew 14% year-on-year, or 18% excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 9.7% and represents a sequential improvement of 150 basis points. Total service revenue increased 28% to $527 million, driven by organic growth of 22%. These results reflect the strong performance of our commercial team and their laser focus on selling the full suite of products and solutions across our portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA was $469 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up over 16% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As the dollar strengthened significantly since the time of our last call, I think it will be helpful to provide a bit more context. As compared to the rates we were using in August, the stronger dollar resulted in an incremental headwind in the third quarter of approximately $10 million to revenue and $3 million to EBITDA. Under the same FX rates we were using in our August projection, third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately $1.3 billion and $472 million respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected and improved 120 basis points sequentially, driven by revenue management and mix.  AFFO was $288 million or $0.98 on a per-share basis, up $25 million and $0.08 respectively from the third quarter of last year. Due to the strengthening dollar, there was an approximate $3 million impact to AFFO versus the rates we used in our August projection. Now turning to segment performance, in the third quarter our global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of $93 million from last year or 9% on a reported basis. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 14%. In the third quarter, our team continued to drive accelerating organic growth both in storage and services. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $484 million, an increase of $48 million year-on-year. Turning to our global data center business, we are pleased to report another successful quarter. Our data center storage revenue grew 33% year-on-year. On a total revenue basis, we delivered 13% year-on-year growth. Now as a reminder, in the second half of 2021, we provided unique fit-out services for our Frankfurt joint venture. In the third quarter of 2021, those services resulted in approximately $14 million of revenue. Excluding those fit-out services, on a like-for-like basis our total data center revenue grew in excess of 30%.  We completed 7 megawatts of new and expansion leasing, and with the strength of our expanding pipeline, we now expect to exceed our leasing projection of 130 megawatts for the full year. As Bill detailed earlier, we are continuing to expand our data center platform into new markets. We closed the Madrid data center transaction early in the fourth quarter for an initial purchase price of $78 million, which is subject to an additional $10 million earn-out. Turning to corporate and other, revenue increased 22% on an organic basis and nearly 120% in total, driven by our ALM business and continued strength in fine arts. Within ALM, our organic IT asset disposition business continued on its strong trajectory, growing in excess of 20% year-on-year. Turning to ITRenew, revenue was down sequentially, as we projected on our last call. The business was $5 million below that projection as the lockdowns in China persisted throughout the quarter. We are projecting revenue levels for our total ALM business in the fourth quarter to be consistent with the third quarter. Turning to capital, total expenditures were $309 billion in the third quarter. We deployed $270 million of growth capex and $39 million of recurring.  Turning to the balance sheet, with strong EBITDA performance we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.2 times, an improvement versus last quarter, and I think it is worth noting this marked our lowest leverage level since 2017. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term range of 4.5 to 5.5 times, and we now expect to exit the year at 5.2 times.  Our board of directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 66%, approaching our long-term target range of low to mid 60s percent. Now let me share our projections for the fourth quarter, which incorporate recent FX rates.  We expect total revenue to be approximately $1.3 billion, which represents 12% growth year-on-year. This would be a high teens growth rate on a constant currency basis. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $470 million in the fourth quarter, which represents 9% year-on-year growth, including the negative impact of FX. We expect AFFO to be approximately $280 million, which is $0.94 on a per-share basis. As FX rates have moved significantly both this year and in the most recent quarter, we feel it would be helpful to provide a bit more context. With the FX rates that we used at the time of our August earnings release, our projections for the fourth quarter would be revenue in excess of $1.32 billion, EBITDA of approximately $480 million, AFFO of approximately $290 million, and AFFO per share of approximately $0.97. As compared to our full year guidance ranges, with our year-to-date performance and our fourth quarter projection, revenue is at the low end and adjusted EBITDA is at the midpoint. I would like to highlight that on the same FX rates we were using at the start of the year, we estimate our full-year revenue would be in excess of the midpoint of our range and adjusted EBITDA would be beyond the high end of our range. To conclude, our results reflect the strength of our business model and our teams’ collective execution and focus on growth and operating leverage. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their strong performance and our drive to achieve our ambitions. With that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you for taking my question.  You mentioned last quarter that you were talking about doing a third quarter pricing increase, and it’s usually something that happens, I think, more at the end of the year. Could you give us a little bit more color around the success of your ability to put through some more pricing and its implications for 2023?
Barry Hytinen: Okay, thanks Shlomo - this is Barry. Appreciate the question. We did put in place those revenue management actions we talked about on the last call, so those went into effect in September and you see that beginning in the quarter to take hold in the results. As you would have noted, the implied growth from revenue management, it accelerated in the quarter and that’s been ramping through the year, so think on our global RIM business, it was probably in the 6.5 range - that’s up from about 5 earlier in the year and making steady progress. I would expect in light of the macro environment and the reception that we’ve been seeing with respect to revenue management activities, that that would--we would continue naturally to be at this level as we move into 2023, so we are preparing similar revenue management actions going forward and the reception has been consistent with what we’ve seen over many years. I think it demonstrates the value that we’re driving for our customers. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thanks so much. Barry, can you just--I just want to make sure I have the numbers on ITRenew. How much is in the full year guidance versus where you initially guided, and was the offset the data center deal or--because obviously you’re maintaining despite, it sounds like, a little bit of run-off in IT and FX. Where’s the offset on the guidance?
Barry Hytinen: Okay, thanks Kevin, good morning. Thanks for the questions. On ITRenew, we certainly, as we’ve said throughout the year, been experiencing challenges, like so many other companies that sell into China. With the COVID lockdowns that have persisted and then at one level or another throughout the second half and really throughout the year, that has been a challenge as it relates to our revenue, as Bill and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we’ve assumed that ITRenew will be and total ALM business will be pretty consistent third quarter and fourth quarter at this level. In total, ITRenew was of the order of about $45 million of revenue in the third quarter, and that was, as I said in the prepared remarks, down about $5 million, $6 million from the projection we were using at that time. Thanks for the call-out as it relates to the total business continuing to perform well.  You mentioned the data center deal - just to be clear, that business is only 3 megawatts today, so that is not a driver of revenue performance in the fourth quarter at all, although we are really bullish on that opportunity because Madrid is a market that we’ve wanted to play in for some time and it’s a unique market, as I’m sure you know, from the standpoint of where it is with the energy grid. It’s not constrained like so many other markets in Europe, and we think it is, as a market, one that has considerable opportunity. Our pipeline there is quite good, so we’ll be developing that site and we feel really good about the asset. In terms of the fourth quarter and our ability to continue to deliver strong growth, that’s a testament to our teams’ strong performance across our operations, so in our global records business we’ll continue to see benefit from revenue management, as I mentioned. We’ve had very strong services performance, and we continue to see a ramping business in our data center. Thanks so much for the question, Kevin.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning.  Wanted to drill into the services revenue performance. The growth was very strong in the quarter, up 22% organically. I wanted to see what the sustainability of the drivers are, if you could talk a little bit about contributions from the growth portfolio, particularly digital services, overall services revenue growth, and any other factors such as paper prices or traditional service trends that might impact the outlook for services revenue performance. Thank you.
Bill Meany: Thanks George for the question. We feel really good, as you would have noted, that over the last number of quarters, we’ve been consistently showing north of 20% growth both on our IT disposal business - you know, the traditional part or the organic portion of our asset life cycle management business has consistently been 20% or better, and our digital service business continues to go from strength to strength again, north of 20%. Those are really two of the key drivers driving that overall level of service growth. If anything, we see in both of those areas, the interest in customers, whether it’s helping them at the end-of-life in some of their assets, make sure that it is destroyed in a way that’s secure, or in the digital service business, we see more and more customer interest and actually customer contracting on us helping them with their digital transformation. I think the current environment, we see more rather than less of both of those things, so we feel really good about being able to maintain that kind of level of growth, which is all part of the Matterhorn project that we outlined at our investor event a few weeks ago, that when you put it all together, it drives what we see over the next coming years - you know, consistent growth rates that turn into a CAGR of 10% or better.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could, and probably both for Barry. Just wanted to return to your investor day from September. Maybe you could give us a little color - the $450 million of cash costs you expect to incur over three years as part of Matterhorn, a little more insight into what those costs are, where they’ll be spent to help drive some of the growth rates you laid out longer term. Then secondly, just as you think about capital allocation, if you could talk about you funding plans to achieve the longer term capex guide. I know your long-term debt yields are above 7% today, and obviously the forward curve on short term rates continues to march higher, so just wondering how you’re thinking about managing fixed to floating mix as you fund your elevated data center capex pipeline. Thank you. 
Barry Hytinen: Okay, thank you Eric for the questions. A couple of ones in there.  On Matterhorn, the costs that we spoke about, as you know, we’re moving to a new operating model that Bill just touched on briefly, that being with a global commercial organization, also a global operations function. In those cases, that is a pretty substantial change for us in terms of the way we go to market. On the commercial side, it’s really putting together an organization that is singularly focused on serving our customers on a solution basis and really developing a tremendous amount of excellence around all things commercial.  Then, we are also constructing a global operations function which is meant to serve our customers effectively and drive significant customer satisfaction and high quality service, while also creating and furthering the shared services backbone that we have to support the entire organization. As well, we are moving to a business unit function, that being, as we discussed at the investor day event, storage and asset life cycle management and data center, as you know, so those are pretty substantial changes. We think of it, as Bill mentioned, as a transformation, and with that, probably about one-third of those costs, Eric, will be maybe slightly less, will be specific to enablement to align and transform into that commercial operating function. Then the bulk of the cost will be around in fact transforming the broader operating model, which would include costs that you would expect with respect to that kind of transformation, including activities such as restructuring and furthering our transformation. Thanks for that question. I guess I’ll just note, as I said at the investor event, we would expect to be approaching the run rate of that level in the fourth quarter as we continue to move into the Matterhorn model, as Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks. In terms of the funding plan, I appreciate that question as well. Just as a highlight for those that weren’t able to join the investor meeting, we noted that we expect a five-year revenue CAGR of 10% and a five-year EBITDA CAGR of 10%, AFFO of 8%, and that equates to AFFO per share of, let’s say, 7%, as we said in our slides this morning. With that, it’s a fully funded capital plan through EBITDA expansion and leverage within our target range. You note that rates have moved up recently, and I’ll just note that with--we consider ourselves in a very good position. We have $1.5 billion of liquidity and we’re about 80% fixed, as you know, Eric, and so from time to time, we will continue to term out debt but in light of the very good position we’re in with respect to availability on our revolver and the lowest levels of leverage we’ve experienced since 2017, we can really pick our timing as it relates to that over time, so we will be funding through expansion of EBITDA and leverage within our target range.  I appreciate the questions, Eric. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Wendy Ma with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Wendy Ma: Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. For 3Q, the leasing of data centers seemed a little bit softer compared to historical levels. Could you please talk about the demand trends in your key markets given the current slowing down economic environment, and also, how should we think about the leasing activity maybe heading into 2023? Thanks.
Bill Meany: Good morning Wendy, thanks for the question. We remain really excited and very bullish about our data center businesses. As we said, if you look at--you know, we’ll exceed the 130 megawatts that we had laid out or forecasted on our last call, so we continue to build past that and we see similar momentum as we go into next year, so we don’t see any change in terms of our pipeline that turns into leasing activity as we start approaching 2023.  We continue--there’s always a little bit of lumpiness because these are fairly large contracts when you look at quarter to quarter, but we see continued strength and momentum as we go into next year. I think we are also in key markets - that’s why we’ve expanded in Phoenix, where I mentioned that we’re pretty much fully leased or committed on our current campus in Phoenix, and we’ve expanded there. As Barry mentioned, whilst there is 3 megawatts that comes with the north of 70 megawatts of capacity that we’ve purchased in the Iberian Peninsula, specifically in Madrid, is that comes with a pipeline of activity because we’ve been clearly speaking to our customers and anticipating that move. We continue to see that we’re going from strength to strength in that business and building really strong momentum as we go into 2023.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Andrew Steinerman : Hi. Barry, when talking about the fourth quarter revenue guide of $1.3 billion, could you tell us how that shakes out in terms of organic constant currency revenue growth, and if you could make a comment between storage and service?
Barry Hytinen: Sure. Hi Andrew, good morning, and thanks for the questions. When we look at the fourth quarter revenue rate, that being of the order of high teens growth on a constant currency basis, and something of the order of 17%, 18%, so very strong continuation of trend. I’ll note that that’s basically the rate we’ve been running at through the year, so it’s a very good continuation of trend. From the standpoint of storage and services, as Bill mentioned in response to one of the earlier questions, our services business continues to go from strength to strength. That’s thanks to things like our digital solutions and our historic IT asset disposition business, which is growing in excess of 20% - I think 25% in the most recent quarter, very strong performance. We view many of our businesses as playing in markets that are quite large, growing secularly at double-digit rates, and that we expect to continue to take market share in, so for the fourth quarter, you should expect continued strong performance from both storage and services throughout the business. The only thing I would further underline is that for ITRenew and ALM in general, we’ve assumed it would be consistent on a sequential basis, so you can work into the organic if you’d like from that.  Thank you for the question.
Operator: Again, if you’d like to ask a question, please press star then one. Our next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Good morning, thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to just dig in a little bit on your power cost exposure for the DC business. I believe you’re largely hedged, but maybe you could just give us a bit of color on how you hedged for this exposure and what the order of magnitude is that you expect for costs to go up for your customers specifically. Thank you.
Barry Hytinen: Okay, maybe I’ll take the first part of that, and if Bill wants to add, he can. Thank you Brendan for the question, and appreciate those points that you’re asking about. I think our team has done quite an effective job with respect to hedging and getting us into a place where we’re in a very good position as we work into 2023 as it relates to power. To give you a sense, Brendan, obviously this is a little bit based on forecast of next year, but we estimate that we were in excess of 95% locked in terms of pricing at this point for power; in fact, it’s probably closer to 99%.  I would say the other important point is when you look at our customer base, we have the ability to directly pass power pricing onto roughly 90% of the customers, and that’s either through pass-through or surcharge, for example to retail customers, and in many cases that’s month to month as we’ve highlighted before. For those that we don’t have that direct ability, of course we have the ability to adjust pricing on renewals, and that’s principally in the retail portion of our business. As you know, those are relatively shorter contracts, so we have the ability to price quite frequently or consistently with power, so it’s not a huge headwind. I think the fact that the team has continued to drive gross margins to being consistent, in fact in the most recent quarter up several hundred basis points in our data center business, is a very good testament to the fact that we’re managing the impact of power, which as you know is a margin drag as its increasing, so we feel very good about where we are going into next year as it relates to power. As it relates to pricing more broadly, the thing I would point you to is if you look at our mark-to-market, it has continued to improve throughout the year, and as you know, that’s a lagging indicator in light of when the contracts for renewals were signed, so we continue to see a very healthy environment for pricing within data center, at least within the markets that we operate in there, generally speaking. I would say there’s more demand than supply. We feel very well positioned as it relates to the assets we have and our ability to continue to price. I’ll also note, of course, that construction costs are up and so when you look across the platform of our data center business, we feel very good about how the team is performing.
Bill Meany: The only thing I would add, you were asking about how we manage with the customers, because this has been a pain point for our customers. As Barry said, you can see our margins continue to improve, so as we’re building out operational leverage in the business, which is first and foremost, but we’ve been able to manage the price increases in line with energy costs, so it hasn’t been a drag for us. But for our customers, it’s been a pretty big pain point. Recently, I can say speaking to a customer--a large ecommerce customer in Asia, we actually serve them around the globe but based in Asia, and a large global financial institution, even though we have the-and they do pass the power costs to them, is having the uncertainty in the budgets is difficult with them, so we have been working with a number of those customers to actually buy power in advance, or contract forward for some power that we could give them certainty in terms of what their energy bill is going to be on a rolling 12-month basis. We have been working with our customers to try to minimize the volatility and the pain that they are experiencing, so so far, so good.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session and our Iron Mountain third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Gillian Tiltman: Thank you, Chad. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On today’s call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we’ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today’s earnings materials contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today’s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. Our team delivered another quarter of record results, further demonstrating our resilience in pricing power as the world navigates difficult market conditions and global instability. Our dedicated team continues to develop new and innovative solutions for the ever-evolving needs of our customers. Our durable business model and strong customer relationships consistently drive value for our customers and ultimately, our shareholders. Our record second quarter results delivered our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.29 billion, representing 13% total organic revenue growth and an all-time record for EBITDA of $455 million, in spite of significant FX headwinds. These results are further proof of why we continue to be so encouraged by the increased demand for our services across key markets. Pricing and positive volume trends continue to benefit us in this quarter as we reflected in our organic storage rental revenue growth of 8.2%. As we have been sharing with you over the past few quarters, we have been growing quickly, even faster than our own expectations. A major driver for this growth is a direct benefit from our continued innovation, which has increased the size of the total addressable market for our products and services by 12 times to $120 billion, most of which is in faster-growing sectors. Accordingly, we are forecasting revenue growth to continue to accelerate in the back half of the year, driven by strong revenue management in our Global RIM business unit, growth in our data center business, digital information management solutions and improving trends in downstream demand for our hyperscale asset life cycle management or ALM business, which we acquired through the acquisition of ITRenew in January of this year.  I now would like to take this opportunity to share a few highlights of our customer wins. To begin with, our records management business, we have had a long-standing relationship with a major global accounting organization for more than 20 years. They were in the midst of reviewing their records management program when they learned of our Smart Sort solution. We calculated that Smart Sort could help them classify and destroy co-mingled records that have various retention schedules and a much faster and more cost-efficient way than if they were to do so in-house. This led to a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the power of our tools and techniques, which resulted in a deal that closed month sooner and expanded the records management program we performed for them across not only the outsourced records but their in-house records as well. Moreover, this win has already led to other exciting conversations with the customer about digital transformation opportunities. The deal has also opened more opportunities with the customer in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. On the digital solutions side, we recently won a contract with a large insurance and financial services company in the United States. They had previously only used us for shredding services, aligned with the acceleration of the digitization initiatives, they needed solutions to help them create greater business efficiencies whilst maintaining data security for the sensitive information their company handles every day. We provided a cloud-based solution to further support their work from anywhere initiatives by delivering information to their associates wherever they are in a secure and easy-to-access manner. Our team listened to the customers’ needs and tailored a near-site Digital Mailroom solution to effectively meet their needs by leveraging an Iron Mountain owned and operated record center located near the customers’ headquarters. As a result, we will digitize and distribute 10 million pieces of mail annually. As part of the special handling process, we will also leverage our InSight solution for checks and other items deemed to be sensitive. Over time, we expect to leverage the full suite of InSight solutions to process all of their mail, leveraging workflow automation through the use of our embedded artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. This innovative solution will dramatically improve mail processing times through automated routing as well as classification and governance. These wins demonstrate the merits of strong customer loyalty, coupled with our solution-oriented approach in serving our customers. We are sharply focused on understanding their job to be done in delivering solutions, which are both innovative and impactful. Now to switch gears, I’d like to share a recent data restoration and migration win that led to an ALM win, thanks to a deep and trusted relationship with one of our customers, a large Australian bank. They have been growing through acquisition and as part of their integration plans have been decommissioning their data centers to move to a large cloud provider. To help enable this transition, we recognize that they would benefit from better access to their data on tapes, leading to one of our biggest data restoration and migration services contracts. This is in and of itself a great win, but it led us to an even larger opportunity to assist this long-standing customer. Based on our strong partnership, we were able to help the customer manage their decommissioned data center assets by offering an introduction to our ALM services. This win is an important entry point and shows our ability to help our customers solve multiple business challenges. It also reinforces the cross-sell opportunity in ALM. In our ALM segment, in addition to the Australian bank, this quarter, we closed a deal with another large global bank, whereby Iron Mountain will provide on-site media destruction and data center equipment recycling to 42 data centers, campus locations and branch offices. The program will also expand to corporate and user assets in multiple global locations. This customer contacted Iron Mountain in January of 2022 to inquire about our secure IT asset disposition services due to poor performance from their incumbent vendor. Our team engaged with the bank’s key stakeholders to discuss their service requirements, data security policy and pain points in order to best position our solution. Our best-in-class logistics, asset processing capabilities, data security practices, transparent reporting, and strong client relationships were critical to securing the win. Moreover, our acquisition earlier this year of ITRenew and the resulting ability to in-source all asset processing capabilities in the U.S. convince this customer that we have the strongest capability set to service them. We are also pleased to report another ALM win with a large cloud customer wherein we were awarded part of a $60 million global RFP. The customer currently uses a multi-vendor approach with a vendor assigned per region. ITRenew was the largest provider to them in North America for value recovery and on-site drive destruction. Now that Iron Mountain has completed the acquisition, the customer has additionally awarded us their Irish business, along with expansion of the North American business to include shredding and recycling hard disk drives. We won this business in part due to our track record of achieving the highest value for the resale of decommissioned components, our global footprint and our excellence in asset tracking. We are very encouraged by the continued growth of IT assets contracted to us for disposal as well as the wins with new and existing clients. However, like all global businesses exposed to computing equipment, the latest COVID-19 shutdowns in China have had a negative short-term impact. This impact has been most particularly pronounced in May and June. There is a higher-than-normal backlog of material, which we hold on consignment that cannot be sold until we can deliver it to the manufacturers in China who are using the recycled components in their goods. Whilst China’s zero-COVID policy makes it hard to predict when manufacturing rhythms will return to normal, we do expect to see an acceleration of our sell-through once the situation does indeed normalize. In summary, the continued growth we have seen in the upstream supply of IT equipment needing to be securely and safely recycled further increases our excitement about this sector once downstream demand for recycled IT components reverts back to its usual levels. Finally, our data center business has been extremely active this quarter, and we successfully completed 83 megawatts of leasing. This included a 72-megawatt lease for two buildings on our Northern Virginia campus. Both of these facilities are effectively stabilized as we have pre-leased 100% of the capacity to a Fortune 100 company. Today, we are happy to announce a joint venture for these assets with a subsidiary of Hana Financial, a global real estate firm. Full build-out of these two sites is expected in the third quarter of 2025, and Iron Mountain will be responsible for managing the design and development of the data center shell as well as administrating the leases. Also in this quarter, we signed a hyperscale tenant on our Phoenix, Arizona campus. With this new lease, the customer has existing capacity in three of our locations. This win increases their geographic presence with us as well as introducing the client to the Phoenix market for the first time. We’ve also been active on colocation this quarter in our data center business. We had a new customer win with one of the largest managed service providers, which has existing data centers in North America and Europe, and we’re looking to gain entry into strategic emerging markets such as India. To that end, we were able to accommodate this customer through our Web Werks, JV, in Mumbai for data center capacity. When we originally entered India through this JV, we operated in three markets. We have spent much of the last year focused on securing land to expand our footprint in our existing markets as well as two additional new markets now. We believe as we work through planning and permissioning on these parcels, we will have over 100 megawatts of sellable capacity in the Indian market over the next couple of years. Having personally visited India already twice this year. I and we remain very excited about – about the opportunities we are seeing in this exciting market, both for data center as well as our business more broadly. These wins show how our focus towards building an extraordinary set of synergistic and customer-centric solutions, combined with our global reach and footprint both differentiates and propels our growth forward.  As we have discussed before, we are focused on driving commercial activity, including cross-selling our solutions to our customers, and this quarter, nearly all of our data center bookings were signed with existing customers of Iron Mountain. To conclude, I am incredibly proud our team has continued to build on our growth momentum, expand our portfolio and not only meet but exceed our customers’ evolving needs. This is evidenced by our outstanding and record results this morning, including our highest ever revenue and all-time record EBITDA as well as the highest rate of organic revenue growth in the last 25 years. We expect to continue to build on these results as we further the growth of our business based upon a strong global footprint, a powerful portfolio of products and services and our deep customer relationships. We have a very exciting future, and I can’t wait to see all we continue to accomplish together. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the second quarter, our team delivered strong performance across all metrics, meeting top-line projections while exceeding projections on EBITDA and AFFO. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.29 billion, grew 15% year-on-year or 18% excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Incidentally, the dollar strengthened significantly since the time of our call in April and resulted in about $15 million of incremental revenue headwind versus our prior projections for the second quarter. A key highlight in the quarter is our organic storage revenue, which grew 8.2%, reflecting strong revenue management and data center commencements. Total service revenue increased 34% to $536 million with 21% organic growth. In total, this was driven by strength in our core service offerings, including digital solutions and our acquisition of ITRenew. Adjusted EBITDA was $455 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up 15% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. We had strong contributions from revenue growth driven by pricing and data center storage along with ongoing productivity improvements. The higher level of EBITDA was despite the significant impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and the disposition of our software escrow business last June. Combined, those two items are about $17 million of year-on-year headwind. The deconsolidation last quarter of the former OSG records business in Russia offset the benefit from ITRenew. With solid flow-through, second quarter EBITDA exceeded the expectations we shared on our last call by $5 million on a reported basis and by $10 million using the same FX rates included in our April projections. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected and improved 80 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2022, driven by price and mix. AFFO was $271 million or $0.93 on a per share basis, up $25 million and $0.08, respectively, from the second quarter of last year. In both cases, we exceeded our expectations. Now turning to segment performance. In the second quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of $74 million from last year or 7% on a reported basis. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue increased 11%. Constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 6.4% exceeded our expectations for the quarter. These results reflect the strong performance of our commercial team and their focus on selling the full suite of products across our portfolio. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $469 million, an increase of $45 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 120 basis points year-on-year, reflecting pricing strength and productivity.  Turning to our global data center business. Our team delivered another successful quarter of executing our strategy. On a revenue basis, we delivered 30% year-on-year growth, and a particular highlight for me is the 24% organic storage revenue growth. As we noted on our last call, we signed a 72-megawatt lease on our Virginia campus with a long-standing hyperscale customer for a near build-to-suit. As Bill noted, we have recently established a joint venture for this asset, whereby we will retain a 55% interest and generate a strong return. We completed an additional 11 megawatts of leasing in the quarter for a total of 83 megawatts. We are confident in our 130-megawatt projection for new and expansion leasing this year, thanks to the momentum from the first half of the year, combined with our strong bookings pipeline. Turning to our corporate and other business. Revenue increased 156% year-on-year, driven by our ALM business, including the ITRenew acquisition and organic growth in our Fine Arts business. For modeling purposes, let me call out a couple of minor changes we’ve made to our reporting to be consistent with how we are managing the company. First, all of our ALM business is now included in corporate and other, whereas previously, our legacy IT asset disposal business was in Global RIM. Secondly, our Entertainment Services business and certain costs that support our commercial organization have been moved from corporate into Global RIM. We have updated our historical financials to allow for comparability and those will be made available on our investor relations website later today. In our asset life cycle management business, as Bill mentioned, we are very optimistic with regard to the underlying trends in this category. And importantly, our committed backlog remains strong and growing and currently sits at a record level as we speak to you today. Turning to capital recycling. In the second quarter, we generated approximately $91 million. Total capital expenditures were $188 million, of which $156 million was growth and $32 million was recurring. We continue to expect total capital expenditures for the full year to be approximately $950 million, which includes $625 million for data center development and $155 million for recurring CapEx. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times, which reflects a sequential improvement from the first quarter. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term range of 4.5 times to 5.5 times. We continue to expect to exit the year at levels within our target range. And with our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October. On a trailing four-quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 68%, approaching our long-term target range of low to mid-60s. Now turning to our outlook. For the full year, reflecting our performance in the first half and strong outlook, we expect to deliver revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range despite an additional $60 million of foreign exchange headwind in the second half. And for EBITDA and AFFO, with continued pricing and productivity, we expect to achieve the midpoint or beyond of our full year guidance ranges. Now, let me share our expectations for the third quarter. We expect total revenue to be approximately $1.3 billion, which represents 15% growth year-on-year. I would like to note that we have considerable FX headwinds, both year-on-year and sequentially. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $465 million in the third quarter, which represents 11% year-on-year growth. And we expect AFFO to be approximately $280 million. To conclude, the performance of our business is strong. Our team continues to drive higher levels of growth, and we thank them for their collective efforts and dedication. Our tour is strong with margin is increasing, thanks to pricing and productivity and our investments are driving considerable growth across our business. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming investor event on September 20, at which time we will have the opportunity to discuss our strategy to drive considerable future growth. The event will take place in Northern Virginia and include a tour of our data-centric campus. For those of you who cannot join in person, a live webcast of the presentation will be available. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions]. And the first question will be from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Your revenue management strategy continues to be tracking well in the storage business. Can you provide an update on how much in pricing increases are flowing through in response to the current inflationary environment and how much flexibility you have to reflect up change revenue management conditions as the year progresses?
Barry Hytinen: Hi, George, it’s Barry. Thanks for the question. The team is doing very, very well with respect to revenue management. You would have seen that our organic storage rental revenue growth on an organic basis was up over 8% in the quarter. That marked a nice acceleration even from the higher levels in the first quarter. And in our Global RIM business that was over 6% on that metric. So volume, as you would have seen on an organic basis – in total is up about 2%, but on an organic basis is very consistent with our expectations of being just slightly up, so about 50 basis points. So what you’re seeing is a very strong contribution from revenue management coming through. And I’ll just add on to the second part of your question and note that we are continuing to see incremental opportunities for pricing. And in fact, we will be seeing us move forward with additional pricing actions later in the third quarter that will fully benefit us as we move through the year and then give us a little bit of an incremental lift next year. So those are just in light of what’s going on in the economic activity and the fact that our existing revenue management program has been so well received, we see the opportunity to continue to move higher. So you will see that going forward. Thanks for the question.
Operator: And the next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Barry, can you talk a little bit more just about the ITRenew revenue contribution to the quarter you noted it was light. Can you give us the exact amount? It seems – at least my calculation is somewhere around $65 million. And then maybe Bill, you can talk a little bit as you talk about ITRenew in terms of what were you expecting in the quarter initially in when you had earnings in the first quarter? And how is that different? And how do you expect that to play out over the course of this year? In other words, what’s your target for ITRenew, given what we’re seeing from China, are you expecting to catch up? Or are you expecting some of this to kind of flow into 2023?
Bill Meaney: Thanks. I’ll start, Shlomo and then I think Barry will give you a little bit more specifics in terms of how to think about it from a modeling standpoint. So I appreciate the question. similar to what – when you and I were chatting at your conference here, I guess, a couple of months – almost two months back, summer is almost gone, is that it’s pretty much – as we were speaking about is that it’s really a tale of two cities. So as I said in my kind of remarks talking about a number of the customer wins that we’ve had around IT asset destruction and asset life cycle management, it’s been a really strong quarter. And that’s really where we’re getting the volume of material that we then sell that gets recycled into new equipment going forward. So the – what I would call the upstream in terms of the amount that’s coming to us because of our customer reach, the logistics that we have our know-how to be able to do that in a safe and secure way is that we’re sitting on very strong inventories that’s on consignment to us. So this is stuff that we hold on consignment and then sell on behalf of our customers and ourselves or the suppliers of the components and ourselves, to the downstream manufacturers that reuse that in new component. So the upstream bit is really performing to our expectations, and we feel really good about that. The downstream bit right now is primarily in China. And as we’ve seen the lockdowns even more stronger in May and June than we expected, and they continue with the rolling lockdowns because of their zero COVID policy. So we’re – it’s hard to predict exactly when that will open. The good news is we have the inventory to sell. The minute it does open and every indication is that it will normalize in the foreseeable future. But the timing of that is difficult to predict. So a long way of saying is we’re really pleased with the performance on how it’s resonated with our customers to actually even exceed our expectations and how many customers have come to us to give us their volume of components to be disposed of either to be destroyed completely or recycled downstream. In terms of selling those components downstream, which is where we recognize most of the revenue, it’s been hung up mainly because of the – well, entirely because of the COVID, zero COVID policy in China and the rolling shutdowns. And, Barry, maybe you want to talk a little bit about how we see the rest of the year shaping up.
Barry Hytinen: Yes, sure. Thanks, Shlomo, for the question. You – a couple of things you asked. On the actual contribution, you’ve calculated it correct; it was about $65 million. So that was just a touch up from the first quarter. And as we – as Bill referenced, as we said in early June in light of what we were seeing in the second half of May as well as the continued to see in June in light of the COVID shutdowns that Bill referenced. We certainly, that was below our expectations. That said, in terms of going forward, two things. One is we are planning and in the guidance that I gave you for the third quarter and the target for the full year. We have just assumed that our ITRenew contribution would be consistent going forward at that level or even maybe even a touch below that. And I think that’s a conservative way to position it because as Bill mentioned, we and so many other technology-oriented companies don’t know when China will reopen. But I think once it does, to his point, we have a very strong committed backlog and we have a good amount of consigned inventory that can sell through. I just didn’t want to plan for it to get better. So I view that as – that’s why I described that as I think, conservative because as it opens up, we will be selling through. So we feel very good about the committed backlog and the level of activity we’re seeing from our upstream clients. And as that market reopens, I think we will see a very good sell-through. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. Good morning. Service revenue growth was up meaningfully. I was wondering if you could help us drill down on that. What were the major drivers of the growth? Is it new businesses or a rebound of some business that had slowed down with COVID?
Bill Meaney: Good morning, Sheila. I appreciate the question. So it’s really mainly new businesses, right? I mean, the business has rebounded from COVID, but we kind of saw most of that rebound, to be honest with you, towards the tail end of last year. And there are still certain countries that are kind of going through periodic shutdowns, we talked about China – we were talking about China in terms of ALM, but we see the same thing on the records management side in terms of the rolling COVID shutdowns in China. So the growth that we printed in terms of services is mainly the new areas. And I highlighted some of the wins that we’re driving that on our digital transformation services. So this is really a direct result of taking ourselves from a $10 billion total addressable market for our products and services to the $120 billion [ph]. So that’s where you’re seeing the growth is in those new products and services that are part of that 12 times expansion of our total addressable market.
Barry Hytinen: Sheila, its Barry. The only thing I would add on to that is specifically to build on Bill’s point around digital solutions; we grew high teens in the quarter, which was the best comp we’ve had on that specific line in several quarters. And in fact, it’s against our hardest comp last year. So it really speaks to the fact that our digital business is taking hold and going from strength-to-strength. I’ll note that we had a very strong contribution from our legacy ITAD business as well. That’s in the asset life cycle management business, as you know and that business is growing at the very rates and we see considerable incremental opportunity for that to grow, in fact, just to be clear, it’s accelerating in terms of its level of growth, so we feel great about that business. And then it’s notable to say that our pricing continues to be up across the business that includes services. So thanks for the question, Sheila.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Brendan Lynch from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brendan Lynch: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just touch on Hana Financial and the JV for some of your assets. Obviously, you’ve been trying to grow data center revenue for past couple of years. So it was a little bit surprising to see a joint venture structure. Maybe you could just comment on what your considerations were there?
Bill Meaney: Good morning, Brendan. It’s great to have you on the call. Let me talk about the strategic rationale of why we decided to put that into a joint venture. And then – or to do that deal that way? And then I’ll ask Barry, he can give you a little bit more of the financial details. So first of all, we don’t do – first, we don’t do a lot of build-to-suit or powered shell. And this was for a customer that is one of our largest customers globally in a number of our sites, and they had a specific requirement for Northern Virginia. The other aspect about this particular client is it allowed us to materially expand almost 100 megawatts – roughly around 130 megawatts, 135 megawatts of IT load that we can actually support on that Northern Virginia campus by doing this partnership with this client because we were able to use that to bring in a substation on to our site and we’ve completely secured the power now for the entire Northern Virginia campus. So even net of the 72 megawatts that we are actually leasing as a powered shell is that we’ve actually increased the capacity of that site by another 70-megawatt is another 70 megawatts. So that was really, really important to us. And so the – and it’s a great return on the powered shell. So that’s really our motivation first of all for doing that kind of contract. In terms of why we joint ventured it, it really was very compelling from a financial standpoint. I’ll let Barry talk a little bit about the financial aspects of the deal of bringing in a joint venture partner because I should also add, this is a 100% stabilized asset, right? So we always look at fully stabilized assets and say is that something – we’re focusing most of our capital on development opportunities, not stabilized assets. So we saw that as an opportunity. But then especially when we looked at the opportunity, the financial aspects were just very compelling.
Barry Hytinen: Yes. Hi, Brendan, thanks for joining the call. In terms of the JV, just to be clear, we’ll operate it will, of course, be respond for the construction, the management et cetera. We saw it as an opportunity to leverage third party capital, which allows us to essentially use someone else’s balance sheet and then use ours to go further our development pipeline. As you know, we’ve got a lot of capacity to continue to build out. And as Bill mentioned, this is effectively a fully stabilized asset before we even break ground. And in light of the still very significant investor interest in data center assets, we saw it as a compelling incremental opportunity to even further improve the return that much more as the pre-lease is very attractive to the capital markets. So we’ll maintain a 55% interest in it. We have traditional benefits from the joint venture structure that you’d appreciate as a data center analyst, and I’ll just note that we were able to sell that at a sub four and a half cap. And again, it’s fully stabilized. So we view it as a compelling capital allocation opportunity. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Hi. Great. Thank you. I’ll stick with the data center topic. So kind of interested in how your sales funnel looks after such a strong start to the year, particularly with hyperscale but also on enterprise? And then – on the pricing side, it seems like data center pricing has been lifting even for the larger hyperscale deals. So I’m wondering where you’re seeing pricing today, particularly as supply appears to be getting tighter and tighter in a lot of markets. And then Bill, interested on – in terms of like where – which markets you might need additional land capacity or are there opportunities to do some select tuck-in M&A for no select assets to maybe get some capacity in new markets? Thank you.
Bill Meaney: Thanks, Eric. I’ll start. The – I think first of all, yes, it’s a great problem to have. We’ve been so successful this year in terms of leasing. You’re right to point out that we are making sure that we have capacity to continue to grow at these kind of rates. So the funnel that we have in front of us right now, if you think about we have 118 megawatts leased to date this year with – and we said – we gave you guidance that we’ll do at least 130 megawatts this year. So we feel obviously very comfortable about that. And going into next year, we don’t see any slowdown in terms of the rate of growth. I mean the 72 megawatts that we did in Northern Virginia, I wouldn’t say that’s a one-off because we continue to see in the pipeline similar types of opportunities, whether or not we’ll pursue all those is we’re constantly make decisions based on the specifics around that requirement. But we are lucky that we’re in a situation where, yes, as I said, we don’t necessarily bid it everything that comes by, so we can actually be a bit more selective. And we feel really good about the funnel. We’ll give you, obviously guidance for next year as we get closer to the end of this year. But the – we feel really good in terms of having similar kinds of growth rates going into next year and beyond. In terms of where we need more capacity, obviously in Arizona, we need more capacity, and we’re well on track to be able to do that. We talked about expanding our footprint in India. We just think that’s a really high growth and interesting market. You can imagine that we’re actually – we still have a little bit more capacity left in Frankfurt too, but Frankfurt is another market that we’re regularly looking at we’re well situated in expanding our campus in Amsterdam. So that’s good. London, believe it or not, we’re probably going to be back into the market in London again. So there’s a number of markets, but as you can imagine, is that we’re constantly out to expand it. But right now, I would say that our real estate plan and what we have currently under our control is we feel really good to be able to maintain these growth rates. I mean never say never in terms of acquisitions. We don’t see anything on the horizon, but do we look at kind of what I call brownfield opportunities like we did with Frankfurt too or even when we entered the Amsterdam market. We constantly look at whether it’s better to buy a piece of greenfield land or a brownfield asset that can be rapidly expanded. But I think you can probably think in your mind that mostly what we’re looking at is expanding our land bank in terms of greenfield.
Barry Hytinen: Eric, just to add on, this is Barry. I would say as it relates to pricing, it’s been quite good, and we see that continuing to lift across our data center portfolio. You would see that in our mark-to-market has been improving. And continuing to run a little bit ahead of our expectations, and that’s a little bit of a lagging indicator. So you’ll see more lift there. You’ve seen our new and expansion leases signing at higher levels on a per kilowatt basis, both in the quarter and versus last year, and our renewed leases are coming in better. So that, together with the fact that, churn is running kind of at or below expectations, we feel very good about what the team is doing in our data center business. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up question from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. It looks like you may have done some sale leaseback in the quarter, I thought let fewer buildings. Just wondering how much proceeds did you raise and if pricing has changed dramatically in the light of interest rates?
Barry Hytinen: Hi, Sheila, it’s Barry. Thanks for the question. You’re right. We did do a few transactions. We had about $91 million of proceeds in the quarter. Year-to-date, that’s about $96 million. I continue to expect we’ll probably do for the full year, something like $150 million, maybe a touch more than that in terms of total proceeds. And notwithstanding your point about the market, we continue to find there is a tremendous appetite for industrial assets out there. And we are able to transact in – both in terms of on cap rates as well as on lease terms that are very favorable to us. And as you know, that’s been part of our capital allocation strategy for some time. So we’ll continue to do that is my expectation. Thanks for the question, Sheila.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We thank you for attending today’s presentation and you may now disconnect. Take care.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-28 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2022 Earnings. Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Sir, Tilman, please go ahead.
Gillian Tiltman: Thank you, Brenda. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today. Our team delivered exceptional results for the first quarter of 2022, exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. This record performance is reflective of our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model, and dedicated team. Whilst we are thrilled to report these results, its important to take a moment to acknowledge the events happening in Ukraine and impacting the world at large. As we navigate this devastating conflict, we continue to prioritize our Mountaineers and their families. To that end, I am comforted to share that all 65 of our colleagues from Ukraine continue to check in with our global risk, safety and security team on a daily basis and all are safe. Some families have made the difficult decision to migrate to other countries. And I am proud of how our fellow Mountaineers in the region have offered assistance in providing comfort and resettlement. I continue to be both inspired by and grateful to all the teams in Ukraine and the surrounding countries who have united to support each other in this crisis. I visited the region twice recently and I remain humbled by the strength of our colleagues. And we remain committed to supporting our effective Mountaineers and continue to hope and pray for a rapid resolution of this war. Now if I may, let me begin our discussion of our first quarter results, a record for the company. We achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.25 billion, exceeding our expectations of $1.2 billion, yielding 10% or total organic revenue growth and an all-time record EBITDA of $431 million. We continue to be encouraged by the increased demand of our services across key markets fueling these results. As pricing and positive volume trends continue to benefit us, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 6.8% in the first quarter. We drove double-digit growth in digital offerings, including data center, GDS, digital transformation services, and ALM or asset lifecycle management. As you know, we've been growing quickly and over the past two years, we have been growing faster than even our expectations. I have shared with you previously, how our continued build out of new products and services, as well as growth in these underlying markets has now taken our total addressable market to over $120 billion, accelerating us on our growth trajectory path. Turning to our ALM business, we achieved several solid wins that spanned industries, many of which were made possible through the strong combination of Iron Mountain, and the recently acquired ITRenew, which has been performing even better than we had anticipated. An example of the power of this combination can be seen in our expansion on a customer win with a large financial institution that we were originally awarded in early 2021. With the additional expertise we acquired with ITRenew, we expanded our offerings to include market leading recycling expertise, as the whole world is focused on how to better embrace the concept around a more circular economy and reduce our impact on the environment. Along with this added expertise, we now have a full set of capabilities which are truly differentiating in the eyes of not only this customer, but also most of our global customers. Another ALM win this quarter was for a task order for Iron Mountain to provide on-site media destruction and ALM services to 18 US locations, including data centers and office locations, in which all IT asset types will be included has in scope. Several key factors in awarding us the RFP included secure logistics, global footprint, partner network and existing trusted relationships. For this customer, we expect to expand services to multiple regions, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, India, and Canada. These are just some of the wins this quarter, which demonstrate the strength of our expanded ALM platform, which will directly benefit from IRMs 225,000 loyal customer base, which includes 95% of the Fortune 1000. Our continued drive in building an extraordinary set of synergistic and customer centric solutions, combined with our global reach and footprint propels our growth forward. Now let me share a few examples of how we've been empowering our customer’s success and growth through our diverse digital transformation solutions or GDS offerings, coupled with our customer focus. In the first quarter, we received fully executed service orders for two large deals in the energy vertical for one of the world's largest oil and gas companies. Both projects will allow our customer to identify and access dark data to provide quicker decisions and to better manage their assets. The total value of these two deals represents more than $12 million. We are looking forward to replicating this success with other energy customers. Turning to the Asia Pacific region, I would like to highlight a large win with an Asian full service universal bank that I had the honor to visit in March. Iron Mountain will provide digitization service - services to assist our customer’s local compliance requirements of digital [ph] which are anti-money laundering related requirements for a total contract value of $4 million. We are also thrilled to report a customer win that has resulted in a five year $8 million Digital Mailroom deal leveraging our content services platform or InSight. This Fortune 500 Mutual Insurance customer after handling their own mail in house for more than 100 years came to us with this opportunity which was both complex and emotional for the customer. Our success here is a direct result of our long standing strategic partnership. We also continue to grow our business with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada or IRCC, which facilitates the arrival of immigrants, provides protection to refugees and offers programming to help newcomers settle in Canada. In 2020, Iron Mountain began supporting IRCC with imaging a variety of application forms. There was an immediate need to process a backlog of applications with your staff working from home as a result of the pandemic. Today, we have processed approximately 115,000 applications, representing over 14.7 million images. Building from this initial work in Toronto, we grew the project by securing an additional contract worth $2.9 million. In addition, we recently awarded a 1.3 million RFP to expand this image initiative to Atlantic and Western Canada. This would not have been possible without our work in supporting this customer from day one, positioning Iron Mountain as a critical business partner. In our Crozier business, we are pleased to highlight our installation of a piece of art entitled just what is your position by a distinguished LA artist at the new terminal at LAX. This installation highlights our team's expertise and precision with regard to complicated installation that will now be on display for millions of travelers. Last, but surely not least, turning to our data center business. You will recall that we initially expected to lease 50 megawatts this year. By the end of Q1 however, we had already signed a total of 35 megawatts, including a single tenant of 27 megawatts for our London-2 location. We are excited about the continued demand we see across Europe, as we bring on added capacity to the market in the coming months. Since March, we have sold an additional 72 megawatt lease on our Northern Virginia campus. This is a near build-to-suit type of agreement where we are responsible for leasing on a long term basis the land, the shell and a large portion of the installed MEP or mechanical electrical plant. Iron Mountain's data center solution met the security, scalability and interconnection requirements of the customer in this critical global data center market. The lease is expected to commence and begin ramping mid-year 2024 and it – and has a term of 15 years. Finally, I would like to share with you a joint ESG and data center win. As we have said before, ESG continues to be an important focus for us, shone through many years of producing annual corporate sustainability reports outlining our commitments and progress for nearly a decade. We recently announced a design certification of our Phoenix Arizona AZP-2 data center, the first data center in North America to receive BREEAM certification. We are taking the lead on demonstrating the steps facility owners can take to ensure that their data centers are both efficient and resilient. Design for the facility has been certified under BREEAMs new construction standard, a global recognized green building certification for new developments and achieved the BREEAM excellent rating. This continued focus on building standards, together with already having long term renewable power purchasing agreements which offset at more than 100% of our data center energy requirements places us firmly on the path to reach our 2040 commitments to use 100% renewable energy, 100% of the time. To conclude, we continue to build on our growth momentum and expand our portfolio to exceed our customers evolving needs, as evidenced by our outstanding results this morning, including our highest ever revenue and all-time record EBITDA. With our strong footprint, powerful portfolio and deep customer relationships, we are confident that we will continue this momentum. The future is bright, and I can't wait to see how we can accomplish. With that. I'll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill. And thank you all for joining us to discuss our results. In the first quarter, our team delivered strong performance exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. On a reported basis revenue of $1.25 billion grew 15% year-on-year with total organic revenue up 10%. Revenue was over $20 million ahead of the expectations we shared on our last call. To me, a key highlight in the quarter is our - organic storage revenue which grew 6.8% in the quarter, reflecting our strong pricing and data center commencements. Total service revenue increased 33% to $497 million, driven equally by the ITRenew acquisition and our core service offerings. In fact, organic service revenue increased $59 million or 16%, driven by strong growth across our service lines, including digital solutions. As revenue associated with our traditional transportation services was still down 10% from pre-pandemic levels, we are even more pleased with this performance. Adjusted EBITDA was $431 million, up 13% on a reported basis and up 15% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. We have strong contributions from revenue growth, driven by pricing and data center storage, along with ongoing productivity improvements resulting in EBITDA growth of $50 million. The higher level of EBITDA was despite the impact of the stronger US dollar and the disposition of the software escrow business last June. Combined those two items are about $14 million of year-on-year headwind. Partially offsetting those, is the recent ITRenew acquisition. With solid flow through first quarter EBITDA exceeded the expectations we shared on our last call by $6 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was better than we projected. And while it was lower year-on-year driven by the inclusion of ITRenew, our core Iron Mountain business continue to deliver improved profitability year-on-year, even with investments to fund further growth. AFFO was $264 million or $0.91 on a per share basis, up $29 million and $0.10 respectively, from the first quarter of last year. In both cases, we exceeded our expectations. Now let me spend a moment discussing the impact of the war in Ukraine. In late March, we determined it was appropriate to deconsolidate the majority of the OSG records business, which is principally doing business in Russia. As a result, we wrote down our investments to a fair value of zero and accordingly recognized a charge through the other expense line. Going forward, we will no longer be including these entities in our financial statements. Also in our other expense line this quarter, we have a gain on the MakeSpace Clutter merger as I mentioned on our last call. The deconsolidation does not impact our business in Ukraine, which continues to be included in our results. With reduced revenue and a conservative position on accounts receivable, we recognized a loss in our Ukrainian business during the first quarter. I want to echo Bill's comments. We continue to keep all of our Mountaineers in their families in our thoughts during this ongoing human tragedy. Now turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.04 billion, an increase of $76 million from last year or 8% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis revenue increased 10%. Constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 6.4% or 4.6% on an organic basis reflects our focus on revenue management, and solid volume trends which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. I will note, that in our supplemental financial information, we have shared a reconciliation of our volume with and without the deconsolidated entities to allow for comparability going forward. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $451 million, an increase in $43 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 100 basis points year-on-year, reflecting continued pricing strength and productivity. Turning to our global data center business, we are very pleased with our results. On a revenue basis, we delivered 36% year-on-year growth or 33% organic growth. A particular highlight for me is the 26% organic storage revenue growth we delivered in the quarter. As Bill discussed, the team has done exceptionally well with new bookings. And with that we are raising our full year outlook on new and expansion leasing to 130 megawatts, up from our prior expectation of 50 megawatts. Now to provide some historical context to that, we leased 10 megawatts in 2018, 17 megawatts in 2019, 31 megawatts in 2020, excluding our joint venture in Frankfurt and 49 megawatts last year. With the strength of our performance in the first quarter, we now project full year data center revenue growth of at least 20% year-on-year, with even higher rates of growth for storage. With our strong prior year bookings and recent commencement, we have very good visibility to revenue. Turning to our corporate and other business, revenue increased 146% year-on-year driven by the ITRenew acquisition and organic growth in our closure business. For modeling purposes, please note that our legacy IT asset disposal business continues to grow 8% [ph] in the Global RIM segment. Total capital expenditures were $150 million, of which $115 million was growth and $35 million was recurring. In 2022, we now expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $950 million, up $100 million from our prior expectations. This reflects an increase to our data center development CapEx plans, given our strong leasing year-to-date and our very positive outlook. Turning to the balance sheet. With strong EBITDA performance, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4 times. This is an improvement from last year and better than the projection we shared on our last call. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. We continue to expect to exit the year at levels within our target range. As you may have seen in March, aligned with our growth plans, our team successfully refinanced our credit agreement which includes a $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and a $250 million term loan A facility. The amendment provides for nearly $550 million of additional borrowing, includes favorable terms and extends the maturity to March 2027. We want to thank our commercial lending group for their continued support. And with our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend at $0.62 per share to be paid in early July. On a trailing four quarter basis, our payout ratio is now 69%, approaching our long-term target range of low to mid 60%. And now turning to our outlook. We are pleased to reiterate our full year 2022 guidance. I should note that this is despite the impact of the deconsolidation and the stronger US dollar. With the closing of the ITRenew transaction, I thought it would be helpful to share our preliminary view on purchase accounting. We currently anticipate amortization of intangibles to be approximately $60 million annually. And with only two months of results in the first quarter, we amortized $10 million. Naturally these charges are included in our adjusted EPS and FFO. Now let me share our expectations for the second quarter. We expect total revenue to be approximately $1.3 billion. We estimate organic growth to be high single digits to approaching 10% in the second quarter. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $450 million and we expect AFFO to be approximately $260 million. The war in Ukraine and the deconsolidation is nearly $5 million headwind versus the second quarter of 2021 and sequentially versus the first quarter of 2022. In summary, our investments are accelerating our growth trajectory. Our customer relationships are strong, our core is performing well. And we continue to realize incremental pricing opportunities across our business. Our focus on higher growth segments, including data center, asset lifecycle management, and digital solutions are positioning us for continued success. I would like to thank our entire team for their strong contributions. We look forward to updating you on our progress following the second quarter. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have on the phone lines comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. So please go ahead. I have opened your line.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. Good morning. You mentioned the addressable market for Iron Mountain expanding? I just wonder if you continue to look at M&A opportunities like ITRenew? And how would you look at financing those types of acquisitions? Would it be sale leaseback or non-core dispositions? Or would you consider common equity as making sense, given the share price gains?
William Meaney: Good morning, Sheila. Thank you for the question. So, I think the first is that we feel really good about the platform, not only the $120 billion total addressable market that we have, but the platform that we have in each of the poor - parts of the portfolio that attack that, if you will, or address that. So we don't see a need to do any, you know, large M&A type deals, like the ITRenew, because I think we now have market leading platforms pretty much in each of those - those areas that we're addressing. So we don't really see that. And we still think that we have a long ways to run in our share price.
Sheila McGrath: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thanks so much. And congratulations on the results. Hey, the storage growth was really, really impressive, the organic, can you maybe unpack that a little bit in terms of what's kind of the pricing, the volume? And then how are you thinking about that, I guess, organically for the balance of the year?
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Kevin.
Kevin McVeigh: Hey, Barry.
Barry Hytinen: We appreciate the comments. And we feel really - we feel really good about how things have been trending. If you look at our Global RIM storage rental revenue growth of 4.6% organic, the vast majority of that is prices, as you can see our organic volume is right in line with what we've been expecting. And so you know, it's been very good performance on pricing. And importantly, we continue to see more opportunity for pricing and, and that's the - on that expectation, I would advise you to think about pricing continue to be at this level or better for the remainder of the year. The other thing that really helped the total company's storage growth is our data center. You would note that our data center storage revenue was up considerably in the quarter. And they are two in light of both the team's phenomenal performance in terms of historic leasing, as well as recent deals and commencement. We expect to see considerable growth on that data center storage line, the entire year, as we were talking about last quarter. So we feel very well positioned, Kevin and appreciate the question.
Kevin McVeigh: Sure. And then just Barry, real quick. It looks like you took up the CapEx guidance. What was the free cash flow in the first quarter and how should we think about that for the full year?
Barry Hytinen: Yeah, Kevin, I will tell you that - thanks for the question on the CapEx. I'll draw people's attention to the fact that we did increase the CapEx guidance by about $100 million versus our prior expectation. That reflects the fact that our data center development CapEx is up about $100 million. So I'm currently planning for $625 million or so of data center development CapEx for the full year. And that's reflecting the fact that the new leases that we've signed, together with continuing to be opportunistic about building the platform, you know, as you've seen, we've had phenomenal new leasing. And so it's sort of a great situation to be able to continue to invest in that business where we're seeing very nice returns. When you think about the model, I would say that you should be seeing a very considerable amount of free cash flow before discretionary in - when you work through our CAD, and we feel very good about how the - how the business is performing.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. You just Barry, it was 525 before going up to 625 on the data center, right?
Barry Hytinen: That's correct, Kevin.
Kevin McVeigh: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We now have the next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead when you're ready.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Hey, Bill, you'd miss me, if I didn't ask you this. But the RIM sequential volumes seem to have gone down about $1.7 million from 4Q to 1Q. I know last quarter, when I asked about it, there seem to be in a certain seasonality in terms of destructions and things like that from 3Q to 4Q. I'm just wondering if you could give us some more color on 4Q to 1Q, I understand that the company's got very strong pricing and being able to offset that in that way. But you know, the expectation was for the year - to end the year, you know, flat to potentially up on the volumes, I want to get some more color on, you know, the reason for kind of sequential decline? And whether you still expect bonds [ph] to be flat?
William Meaney: No, thanks. Thanks, Shlomo. Good morning. So at least I know that you're on. No. And well, first of all, the - in terms of physical volume, we said it's flat to slightly up to the year. But that's looking at our - across our portfolio of everything that we put in our warehouses around the globe, right. So in terms of managing the organic utilization of our facilities based on organic visible volume growth, we still expect that to be flat to slightly up and you know, in this quarter it was up as you see. So looking within records management, we always kind of consider that to be more flat to slightly down. And if you look at the trend, even between Q4 and Q1, and as you watch the business for a long time, you know that both Q4 and Q1, usually have a little bit of noise. And then because people tend to do their destruction programs, either at the end of the year, and some of that goes into the beginning of the year. So you'll always see a little bit noise. But I think if you look at the last say, you know, four quarters, you'll see a very consistent trend on what's happening to our physical volume around the records management. So, we feel really good where it's at. You know, it's kind of staying in that kind of flat to slightly down records management. Our other areas, in terms of physical volume storage is growing quite nicely. So overall, you know, we'd still remain kind of flat to up for the year in physical volume. And then of course, pricing takes that up.
Barry Hytinen: Really, well. I mean, you know, we do have very strong pricing power. And, as we've always said that, you know, inflation, you know, whilst you know, we feel for folks, I mean, inflation is really hurting all of us in many different ways. For the business, it's actually a net positive because we're able to price ahead of inflation, and we have a high gross margin business, so it naturally expands the margins of the business.
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead when you're ready.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. Barry, I just want to check on here how you think about the – of EBITDA divided by the low end of revenues and low end - the high end of EBITDA by the high end to revenues, I get 351 [ph], so above 35%. And then, you know, obviously, we just did 35 - 345, and they implied, you know, same approach for the second quarter to be 346. And so if you're looking for 351 for the year, and of course, I'm going to ask you is that the right way to think about it, you're talking about much higher than 35% EBITDA margins in the second half of the year to make 351, for the full year, and so you can imagine I'm going to ask you, why will the second half margins be notably higher than the first half this year?
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Andrew. You are thinking about that correctly. A couple things to think about. As we move through the year, we have improved mix coming through the business. We do naturally have, as you traditionally have seen in our business, since you followed us for so long, a level of upfront, first kind of quarter costs which ease, we have a level of improved mix going forward. We get more price as we move through the year. We also see very good flow through coming on the data center business. As I mentioned earlier, last quarter, we expect the data center margin to be slightly up year-on-year, and we see good flow through coming through in the back half there as well. And then, generally speaking, we will continue to comp with positive benefit from Project Summit and other ongoing productivity initiatives. So, you know, I would say first off, I should remind folks that in the first quarter, we did better on a margin basis than we anticipated. That's because the core Iron Mountain business performed very well in terms of productivity and pricing. And we see that trajectory continuing through the year. So sitting here, after one quarter, I feel quite good about where we are in the margin trajectory, Andrew.
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question on the line from Nate Crossett of Berenberg. Sir, please go ahead when you're ready.
William Meaney: Operator, maybe put up the next question.
Operator: The next question we have comes from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead when you're ready.
Eric Luebchow: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So I was interested in the 72 megawatt data center, shell and land and MEP lease you mentioned. I imagine that's a pretty capital efficient lease structure, given its size. But maybe you could kind of give us some color on the returns you'd underwrite, to under that type of structure, the capital intensity? And then whether you're seeing more of these shell type deals versus a typical turnkey lease that you could do here in the future?
William Meaney: Hi, Nate [ph] So no, thanks for the question. Yeah, as you say, we were very pleased to sign this deal for our data center campus in Northern Virginia. There is a couple bits, we'll go into more detail on the second quarter call, because you can imagine that we just signed this agreement, as we come in. But as I said, it's - it's a near build to suit. I mean, we don't - we're not providing all the MEP. And we'll actually go into a little bit more details in terms of how the pieces come together. But besides the 72 megawatts, the other thing that we were very excited about, it allowed us to build further infrastructure on that side, bringing on a substation onto the campus, which is going to drive benefits, both in terms of upscaling the capacity, but also the cost to deliver on that on that campus. So there's a number of different pieces there that make this deal very attractive. But we'll give you more information on the second quarter call. But you're right to say that it's a very capital efficient structure. And with a great tenant on the backside for 15 years, so it allows us to finance it in a very efficient way.
Eric Luebchow: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then one more for me, Barry, you mentioned service revenue associated with kind of the legacy transport business was down about 10% from the pre-pandemic level. So, I mean, have you seen any improvement in that over the last few quarters? And do you expect that to recover back to pre-pandemic levels at some point? And if it does, kind of what will it take to get there, is it more return to office or any other kind of macro related metrics we should be looking at?
Barry Hytinen: Thanks for the question, Eric, and appreciate the continued interest. Of course, we have seen that line continuing to perform better over the last several quarters and kind of consistently, that's been trending better. And we do - I will say, you know, if you look at our service activities, since the early days of the pandemic, we obviously were down a lot in the early days and then moved appreciably better sequentially, quarter-by-quarter. We are far in advance of return to office and I would say we continue to outpace return to office. The way I think about it is, it likely has a continued tailwind going forward. I don't think any of us expect office to be at the same level of occupancy going forward, as it was pre-pandemic. But even still, as the levels continue to rise over the coming quarters, I think that becomes a little bit of a tailwind for our service. The other thing I'll just point out is the new service offerings that we've been delivering to our customers like in IT asset disposal and digital solutions. They have been doing phenomenally well, as Bill highlighted in his prepared remarks. And we see that trend continuing. And it's really strength to strength in that line, Eric. And those are very good profitability for us as well. So we feel quite well positioned on the service line. And then you will see additional service obviously coming through with our recent ITRenew acquisition, as that business continues to build.
Operator: Thank you. We now have the next question on the line from Shlomo from Stifel. Sir, please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you for putting me back in. Just on the storage business, the storage rental gross profit section has facilities costs going up about you know, $17 million or so sequentially. I don't know if there was a build and put in place that went in over there. Is there - can you give us a little bit more color on that because storage gross rental margin went down 110 basis points and just want to see if that's - what's driving it?
Barry Hytinen: Yeah. Thanks, Shlomo. It's a good question. Appreciate that one. So the way to think about it is, we have both for service growth - storage rental gross margin, there's a factor of both sale leaseback, but you are specifically asking about other facility costs. And on that line, that's also where our power for data center pass through goes through, and so that was actually - naturally up both sequentially and year-on-year. Incidentally, just to give you a frame [ph] if you normalize for sale leaseback and excluded the power, we basically have storage rental gross margin up in both sequentially, as well as year-on-year by about 40, 50 basis points. So we feel quite good about the way the business is trending. And the other thing I'll say is, our guidance naturally assumes a healthy, as I mentioned last quarter, a healthy amount of inflation. And we continue to track at levels that are below what we were projecting earlier in the year. And of course, the pricing is doing better. So that's part of the reason why the profitability in the core business continues to outperform.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We now have George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You talked about favorable traction in your ALM business. Can you elaborate on how ITRenew performed in the quarter on revenue and EBITDA relative to your initial expectations?
Barry Hytinen: Yeah, thanks. Thanks, George. It's Barry. It performed right in line with our expectations, maybe even a little touch better than the expectations we shared on the last call. Obviously, that's just for the first two months of the acquisition. And as we see it, and that's both on revenue and a EBITDA basis. As we see it playing out for the year, I continue to project in our guidance, the same level call it around $450 million in that same profitability level that I mentioned. And as we see the business being growing considerably over time, I will tell you that one of the nice things that we see in that business is the building level of backlog, as many of our upstream clients are building their backlog for decommissioning, as we move into the later part of the year, in light of the fact that there's been some level of supply chain disruption for a new gear, we do see their backlogs building. So that is, I think, a favorable view for us going forward.
Operator: Thank you. We now have a question from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. So please go ahead, I have opened your line.
Sheila McGrath: Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk about rising interest rates and near term impact to Iron Mountain, where do you think you could raise debt capital for a 10 year bond now versus maybe fourth quarter?
Barry Hytinen: You know, Sheila, hi, it's Barry, you know, the good news about our model in light of the fact that as you saw in my guidance, we expect the leverage to be kind of inside our range and essentially flattish to maybe even slightly down by the end of the year from where we are now. We were in the fact that we have no near term maturities. I really don't need any long term at this point. As you know, we did the bond in December for the ITRenew transaction, so I'm pleased with the timing of that in light of where we were able to price it. I feel very good about where we are with respect to the capital markets for you know debt and don't have any need at this point or for the next few years, really
Operator: Thank you. We have no further questions raised. [Operator Instructions] We have had no questions registered. So I'd like to hand it back to the management team.
William Meaney: Thank you for joining us today and you can all disconnect.
Operator: You have been removed from the call. Good bye. This does conclude today's call. Thank you again for joining. You may now disconnect your line. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-24 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gillian Tiltman, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Gillian Tiltman: Thank you, Emily. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Barry Hytinen, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2 and our annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William Meaney: Thank you, Gillian, and thank you all for taking time to join us today. We are pleased to have delivered record performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. These record results are reflective of our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model and our dedicated teams. Despite the challenges associated with the pandemic and most recently with the Omicron variant, our Mountaineers around the world have continued each and every day to put our customers first now with renewed and invigorated focus on growth. And our historically high revenue and profitability are a testament to our Mountaineers' commitment. Speaking about our Mountaineers, I wish to begin my remarks by stating that we are all saddened by the overnight events in the Ukraine. Our thoughts and prayers are with our customers there and our fellow 60 Mountaineers and their families living and working in the Ukraine. I am sure for all of us, given the current events in Europe, it deals in many ways inappropriate discussing our financial results with this backdrop. Yet at the same time, it is in keeping with our Mountaineer spirit. With that, let me begin our discussion of our remarkable and record year. In the fourth quarter, we achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.16 billion, yielding 8.5% of total organic revenue growth and record EBITDA of $431 million. For the full year, we achieved record revenue of nearly $4.5 billion and EBITDA of $1.6 billion. These results were fueled by increased demand for our services across key markets. For the full year, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.6%, reflecting continued benefit of pricing combined with positive volume trends. We drove double-digit growth in digital offerings, including data center inside our digital transformation services and secure IT disposition, now referred to as ALM, or asset life cycle management. Our digital services and ALM businesses continue to build momentum, growing over 20% in the fourth quarter and capping off an excellent year of growth. Further to our recent success in the ALM area, we are also pleased to report that the acquisition of ITRenew, announced in December, closed in January. This acquisition will accelerate our growth trajectory in this $30 billion market, which is growing over 10% per year. Our newly created ALM division will absorb our historical secure ITAD business line. This enlarged division not only helps us provide chain of custody for our customers' IT assets, but our ALM activities also assure our customers that their IT assets are wiped of any data at the end of their life and destroyed and recycled in a responsible way. On this last point, in terms of recycling, our expanded offerings in this space around a circular economy are important for both IRM's and our customers' ESG goals leading to carbon neutrality. This expanded ALM division also strongly complements our fast-growing data center business, bringing capabilities to serve some of the largest and most innovative companies in the world in a more cradle-to-grave way, consistent with the best security and ESG practices. This expanded ALM platform will directly benefit from Iron Mountain's 225,000 loyal customer base, which includes 95% of the Fortune 1000. This global customer base is supported by 25,000 Mountaineers across 1,450 facilities in 63 countries. Our recent expansions in data center, machine learning-driven data analytics and insights and now ALM are just some of the examples of how we continue to invest in growth to capitalize on our many opportunities ahead, serving a customer base which has been loyal to Iron Mountain for decades. I have shared with you previously how in the last 5 years, these investments have taken the total addressable market, or TAM, of our products and services from $10 billion to some $80 billion. I am happy to report our continued build-out of new products and services in the last year as well as growth in these underlying markets has now taken our TAM to over $120 billion. Our continued drive in building an ever-expanding set of synergistic and customer-centric solutions, together with global reach and scale, is the fuel behind much of the acceleration in our growth. Let me share a few examples of how we've been empowering our customers' success in growth through our diverse solution offerings and unmatched customer service. Our recent customer win with a large aerospace company, where we won a backfile digitization deal of over $20 million, is a superb example of collaboration amongst our entertainment services, technology organization and our global records organization, or GRO. In order to achieve its goal of being a 100% model engineering company and to most effectively use designs and data from historical archives to refine new designs, this aerospace company sought help with the digitization and auto classification of over 50 million digital engineering assets. We were tasked to store, classify and utilize machine learning to identify relevant information whilst maintaining compliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations known as ITAR. To this end, we developed and implemented an ITAR-compliant solution using our InSight machine learning platform operating in the AWS government cloud environment. Iron Mountain is uniquely positioned to assist our partner with this initiative with our storage capabilities, our understanding of ITAR compliance complexities, our machine learning-trained analytic engines and our technological support to ensure efficiency and success. Moreover, this project enables us to deliver critical insight into engineering data, not just to this company but also to other manufacturing and engineering customers across the globe. Another key win worth highlighting is with a branch of the U.S. federal government. We concluded a Phase 1 contract and have also been awarded a Phase 2 contract for this branch. The agency originally planned to select 3 vendors for the first contract due to the high volume of microfilm reels needing to be processed, but our solution surpassed the customer's expectations, and Iron Mountain was awarded the exclusive contract to process all 177,000 of microfilm reels or over 2 billion records needing analysis. This win was based on our unique splitting technique, proprietary machine learning, automated QA process and processing scalability that helped us to differentiate our offer from the competition. These technology innovations for the customer have enabled future use cases, which rely on advanced pattern recognition at scale, including OCR microfilm processing projects, applying machine learning extraction techniques for digital mailroom, invoice processing and extracting information from claims documents, to name a few. Another example how Iron Mountain is working with customers to support their digital transformation is our recent partnership with a production and development company operating in the U.K.'s North Sea. We've undertaken a significant back scan of their legacy archive records to meet their regulatory obligations to the U.K. oil and gas authority in order to relinquish their license to operate on 230 wells they wish to abandon. They're required to digitally upload all information assets to the National Data Repository. Using the InSight platform, we were able to solve the problem of having enormous amounts of data to sift whilst consolidating physical and digital data in disconnected information silos and resulting in millions of dollars of annual savings. Moving back above ground, recently in our Crozier Fine Arts division, we won a contract to provide comprehensive storage solutions and logistical support for the museum operations of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. We were excited and proud that based upon a foundation of long-term partnership and trust built up through many years of support from Iron Mountain's Entertainment Services division, they came to us to meet their evolving needs where Crozier services were an ideal match. Now turning to wins in our data center business. Recall that our bookings target for the year was 30 megawatts. We are pleased to have finished the year with nearly 49 megawatts of leases signed with over 27 megawatts of leases in the fourth quarter alone. This includes the new 20-megawatt lease in our Manassas, Virginia data center announced in December. This lease is expected to commence in phases from mid-2022 through mid-2023. We continue to see strong demand for comprehensive data center solutions from our existing customer base. This lease is indicative of our ability to meet that demand and reflects our commitment to strategically partnering with our customers to meet their individual requirements. Based on current design plans, we now expect that the VA2 facility to support 36 megawatts, up from 30 megawatts previously. With these changes and other additions to our portfolio, our total capacity is now in excess of 600 megawatts. Finally, we continue to be recognized for our leadership around ESG. This has been an important focus for us for many years, having produced annual sustainability reports outlining our commitments and progress since 2013. Some of our past recognitions have included: 100% of our data center power is generated by renewables; we were the launch provider of Green Power Pass, which allows our customers to report reductions in their carbon footprint when using our data centers; we were a co-signer with Google to expand our commitment to green-powered data centers to 24/7 carbon-free electricity; and we were one of the original signatories of the UN Global Compact on Sustainability back in 2016. More recently, we announced, in addition to their RE100 program, we have joined the Climate Group's EV100 initiative and reached a key milestone in electrifying our global vehicle fleet in line to reach our climate pledge commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040. We have made real progress towards our carbon reduction goals. Since establishing our first science-based targets, we have reduced absolute greenhouse gas emissions by over 60% from our 2016 baseline whilst growing the business. We believe that our commercial growth and ESG initiatives make us stand out, and we suspect they were a major factor of our being ranked amongst the top 100 on Newsweek's list of America's most responsible companies. In summary, our future ahead is bright. We are building on our growth momentum as we expand our portfolio to meet our customers' evolving needs. And with our strong footprint, powerful portfolio and deep customer relationships, we are confident that we can continue this momentum as we ascend our mountain range and provide another set of performance records this year and the years ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results. In the fourth quarter, our team delivered strong performance, exceeding the expectations we provided on our last call. Before I dive into our results, I would like to take a moment to thank our dedicated Mountaineers for their outstanding performance and continued commitment to Iron Mountain. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.16 billion grew 9.4% year-on-year with total organic revenue up 8.5%. Revenue was $10 million ahead of the high end of the expectations we shared previously despite the U.S. dollar strengthening and being more of a headwind in the quarter. As an example of the momentum we are building, on a 2-year basis, our total organic revenue growth continued to accelerate in the quarter. Organic storage revenue grew 3.6% in the quarter, reflecting our strong pricing and data center commencements. Organic service revenue increased $65 million or 17.6% driven by continued strong growth in digital solutions and asset life cycle management. As revenue associated with our traditional transportation services were still down nearly 10% from pre-pandemic levels, we are even more pleased with this performance. Adjusted EBITDA was $431 million, an increase of $56 million from last year. As a result of strong flow-through driven by pricing and productivity, fourth quarter EBITDA exceeded the high end of our expectations by $6 million despite additional FX headwind. AFFO was $267 million or $0.92 on a per share basis, up $76 million and $0.26, respectively, from the fourth quarter of last year. In both cases, we significantly exceeded the high end of our expectations. Now let me briefly summarize the full year. Revenue of $4.5 billion increased 8% on a reported basis and over 6% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% year-on-year to $1.635 billion, an increase of $159 million year-on-year. We achieved the high end of our full year guidance. AFFO increased 14% to $1.01 billion or $3.48 on a per share basis, in both cases, exceeding our full year guidance ranges. Now let's turn to segment performance. In the fourth quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.02 billion, an increase of $76 million from last year or 8% on a reported basis from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 7%. Constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 4.2% or 2.5% on an organic basis reflects our focus on revenue management and solid volume trends. With positive volume trends and growth in our adjacent and consumer businesses, total physical volume was in line with our expectations for the quarter and the year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $453 million, an increase of $49 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 160 basis points year-on-year, reflecting continued pricing strength and productivity. Turning to our global data center business. Our team booked 27 megawatts in the quarter. For the full year, bookings came in at 49 megawatts, significantly exceeding our full year guidance of 30 megawatts. We are very pleased with the team's leasing performance. To give some historical context, we leased 10 megawatts in 2018, 17 megawatts in 2019 and excluding our joint venture in Frankfurt, 31 megawatts in 2020. In terms of revenue, as we projected, fourth quarter growth accelerated to 25% year-over-year. Storage revenue grew 18% year-on-year, and service revenue was up sharply and in line with our projections. As a reminder, service revenue in the second half includes fit-out services we are providing to our Frankfurt joint venture. We expect that activity will be completed early in 2022. Even with the large service component, EBITDA margin increased sequentially with strong commencements. We are pleased with our data center performance, and our pipeline has continued to strengthen, both in terms of hyperscale and retail colocation. In 2022, we expect to lease 50 megawatts, which would represent 28% annual bookings growth. We project full year data center revenue growth in a range of high teens percent year-on-year with even higher growth rates on storage. With our strong prior year bookings and recent commencements, we have very good visibility to revenue. With pricing and improved mix, we expect data center margin for the full year to be up modestly compared to 2021. Turning to Project Summit. This quarter, the team delivered $30 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. For the full year, as compared to 2020, Summit delivered $160 million of benefits. We continue to expect another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $219 million, of which $173 million was growth and $46 million was recurring. For the full year, total capital expenditures were $606 million, of which $309 million was growth capital related to data center development. In 2022, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $850 million. We are projecting approximately $700 million of growth CapEx, with data center development representing about 3/4 of that. We expect recurring CapEx to approach $155 million. Turning to capital recycling. As we have said before, we view the market for industrial assets as highly attractive as a means to supplement our growth capital. With that backdrop, in the fourth quarter, we upsized our recycling program and generated approximately $63 million of proceeds, bringing the full year to $278 million. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3x, in line with our projection and modestly improved compared to last quarter. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5x. For 2022, with the closing of the ITRenew transaction, we expect leverage to tick up modestly in the first quarter. We expect to exit the year at levels within our target range. In December, thanks to strong support from the fixed income community, our team successfully issued 10-year notes to support the ITRenew transaction. From a cash perspective, I would like to recognize our team for driving strong collections, improving our days sales outstanding and resulting in year-on-year improvement in our cash cycle. The collective performance has resulted in a 5-day improvement from pre-pandemic levels. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April. Also, as you may have seen, we are pleased to announce an important strategic milestone related to our unconsolidated joint venture focused on the fast-growing valet consumer storage market. MakeSpace recently completed a merger with Clutter, a similarly sized business also focused on valet storage. We expect the combination will result in considerable benefits, including a focus on a single brand, Clutter, broader reach and natural synergies. Iron Mountain will continue to provide storage services to the business, and our ownership interest will be nearly 25% of the combined entity. We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and expect continued benefit to our total physical volume. Now turning to our outlook. For the full year 2022, we currently expect revenue of $5.125 billion to $5.275 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.8 billion to $1.85 billion. At the midpoint, our guidance represents revenue growth of 16% and EBITDA growth of 12%. We expect AFFO to be in the range of $1.085 billion to $1.12 billion, which represents 9% year-on-year growth at the midpoint point. We expect AFFO per share to be in a range of $3.70 to $3.82. Our guidance assumes organic global physical volume will be consistent to slightly positive year-on-year. We expect revenue management will be a significant benefit, and I will note that the majority of those actions have already been taken as we speak to you today. And nearly all of them will be in place by the end of the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we are planning for a continuation in the strong trends we are seeing in digital solutions and our organic ALM business, combined with a slight recovery in our service activity across the year. Our guidance also assumes the contribution from our acquisition of ITRenew. As we closed the deal at the end of January, we are including 11 months of the results in our guidance. Our guidance includes approximately $450 million of revenue from ITRenew. We estimate the stronger U.S. dollar will result in foreign exchange headwinds to revenue of approximately $60 million year-on-year with the vast majority of that in the first half. In terms of EBITDA, our expectations include the benefit from revenue management and top line growth, the contribution from ITRenew as well as Project Summit benefits. Our EBITDA guidance also assumes a prudent outlook for inflation, rent from our recent sale leaseback transactions, increased innovation spend, the stronger U.S. dollar and the divestiture of the software escrow business, which we sold in late second quarter. With the ongoing volatilities in the market associated with the pandemic as well as the closing of the ITRenew transaction during the quarter, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the first quarter. We expect total revenue to be in excess of $1.2 billion. We expect EBITDA to be approximately $425 million. We expect AFFO to be in excess of $250 million. In summary, our team is executing well. Our pipeline continues to expand, and momentum continues to build across our business. Our addressable market has grown significantly over the last several years, and we expect this to continue to expand. We feel confident in our ability to deliver higher levels of growth. Thanks to our team's collective efforts, together with our strong customer relationships, brand position and investments in innovation, we feel very well positioned as we enter 2022. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Sheila McGrath from Evercore.
Sheila McGrath: The revenue growth that you're targeting in 2022 is very strong. I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail on the drivers of that growth. And if it's more momentum in services, how should we think about the EBITDA margin in 2022 as compared to 2021?
William Meaney: Thanks for the question. So I think I'll talk about, first of all, where the revenue growth comes. And then I'll let Barry comment a little bit on the EBITDA margin, the impact that has. So I think we continue to see 2022 to have the same kind of momentum that we had in 2021. And the momentum that you saw in 2021 was driven by 2 things. First of all, a very solid foundation from our GRO business across the globe. So that continues to drive low single-digit growth and highly profitable. And then a continued acceleration in terms of our new areas, which are everything that includes data center, the digitization platform, which uses the artificial intelligence, machine learning InSight platform as well as the acceleration in asset life cycle management. So we still see that to be strong double-digit growth in those new service areas. So some of those have a different margin associated with it, but that's where we see the fuel of the revenue growth. And maybe, Barry, you want to comment in terms of what that does in terms of EBITDA progression.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks for the question. So we feel great about where we're positioned as it relates to profits and revenue and really see the business building quite well. The things I would call out to add to Bill's comments are you're right, there's a fair bit of services. On a total EBITDA margin, you will see the margin mix down, but that's the contribution of ITRenew. I'd say for planning purposes, if I were you, what we're using in our model is that business, as you would have seen from prior disclosures, is kind of a mid- to high-teens EBITDA margin. But when you get underneath that and back that out, you'd see that our core Iron Mountain margins are actually continuing to improve, and that's driven by the fact that we have very strong pricing contribution this year. From a planning posture, we kind of assumed 2 to 3 points. But as you probably saw in the most recent results, we're seeing the upper ends of that and probably more going forward, so feel very good about our revenue management program. Our data center business is doing phenomenally well, as you've seen, and that is a margin benefit as we move forward. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect our data center profitability to be up modestly year-to-year as a lot of revenue growth coming out of our storage side of the data center business. Of course, our Summit contributions continue to roll in. We'll have $50 million or more from Summit, thanks to the team's very strong contributions. You would have noticed from seeing our most recent results that our services gross margins and EBITDA margins are at very high levels. You can think like up 500, 600 basis points year-on-year in the fourth quarter. I expect that we will continue to see very strong service margin out of the core going forward. So we feel very well positioned, Sheila, and I appreciate the question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Barry, maybe I could just piggy back off the last comment on the services business and the services margin. Can you talk about what drove the gross margin improvement? You had very strong services revenue. Maybe you could talk about how much of that was maybe Frankfurt versus some services that might still be coming back versus just new wins that you've got. And then it's a pretty significant margin improvement sequentially as well. If you could talk about where it's coming from and particularly in the face of inflation and wage inflation and how you're managing that.
Barry Hytinen: Okay. Thanks, Shlomo. I appreciate that. So first thing I'll tell you is on -- since you mentioned Frankfurt is it's not coming from that because those are really almost -- think of those as sort of pass-through revenues on the services business. In fact, that's a hit to our margins. And that's one of the reasons why our data center margin has been a little bit more muted. But as we move through finishing up those services in early '22, that's one of the reasons we expect the margin to be up year-on-year as you'll see a lot more contribution from our storage and, therefore, likely less service revenue coming out of data center. That said, where it's coming from is the core. And as we've said for quite a few quarters now, Project Summit and just general productivity coming out of our operations has been very beneficial. You saw our gross margin to be up, I think it's 550 basis points year-on-year. It was up 400 basis points sequentially. And that's just very strong operating leverage. I would say there's some incremental mix there. Bill spoke a lot about our digital solutions and our asset life cycle management. That is also contributing very nicely. There's some revenue management on our services line as well. So in terms of -- you mentioned about inflation. As I said, at this time last year, I will reiterate, we've been what I think is prudent with our outlook. We have embedded in our guidance a healthy amount of inflation more than we're currently seeing similar posture to what we took last year. And while there is certainly a level of inflation, as we all know, out in the economy, I would look at our more fixed structure and say that together with our revenue management program, we have the benefit of working to drive productivity and seeing a considerable amount of our pricing fall to the bottom line. So we feel very good about where we are positioned currently, Shlomo, with respect to services and the guide in total.
William Meaney: Yes. The only thing I would add, Shlomo, because you know the business really well is the other thing -- the uptick that you see in the services, we're doing, quite frankly, more value-added. I mean, more and more of our digitization services have an ML or machine learning component of it. I mentioned auto classification and some of the work that we're doing. It's not just simple scanning. So there's an analytical piece to that as well, which obviously has a higher margin. And we see almost -- I wouldn't say all, but now it's almost all the new projects we're selling have some component of that, which just naturally attract higher margin. And as Barry said, you've heard us talk about inflation for a long time is that, well, inflation is not good for people on the street, and so I'm not trying to be blase about it for our business because it's such a high-margin business that the pricing action generally is expansion. It has an expansive effect on our margins because our margins were relatively high-margin business. So it's -- yes, we feel good about the progression that we're getting.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh: Congratulations on ITRenew and our thoughts with your Ukrainian employees as well. Barry, if you said this -- I missed it, but can you help us because obviously a sizable step-up in CapEx, which feels like that's around data center, but how should we think about free cash flow in 2022?
Barry Hytinen: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Appreciate the question. So first up on CapEx. Our total CapEx guide is $850 million. Growth capital is $700 million of that. And you are right, as you point out that the data center is getting basically all of that increase. So we are planning our data center development CapEx at $550 million. That's up from about $300 million in 2021. The thing about that is, of course, as you've seen from the strong leasing we've had and the very strong pipeline we have continuing to build that -- and it's a necessity in the sense because we are -- the team is continuing to win great deals around the world. So we're very pleased with the way the data center team is planning. From a free cash flow standpoint, while the CapEx will be up, I'll note that all of our Summit costs are behind us now, Kevin. So there's -- if you think about last year, we had over $200 million of costs to achieve Summit, which go away this year. Have a little bit more cash taxes, of course, with the ITRenew services business and having some more services revenue in our business. And -- but as you look at it, as you get through your model, I think you'll find that there's considerable growth in free cash flow before growth in the model. So I appreciate the question. We look forward to showing you the strength in the cash flow as we move forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: The secure IT asset disposition industry has typically grown in the strong double digits. Can you elaborate on how quickly you expect your new ALM business to grow and what key drivers you're leaning on to support that growth?
William Meaney: So thanks, George, for the question. So as you noticed, we've been getting kind of strong double-digit, roughly, say, 20%. We had a couple of quarters where it was up 30%, kind of in that high teens, kind of low 20s in terms of growth rate going forward, and we continue to see that kind of evolution. We're really impressed by how quickly the book is building, quite frankly, because the ITRenew business had very strong exposure to the hyperscale community, which has direct or synergistic effects with our data center team. So we're finding we're already getting additional traction even beyond what ITRenew is bringing by the discussions that we're having between our data team -- data center team and the ITRenew team that came across talking to the hyperscalers. But then on the other side, to your point, we're -- if you think about our traditional customers, whether it's financial services, insurance or general industry, is those folks that the way they dispose of their IT assets, both from a security standpoint as well as making sure that they disposed in a way that's environmentally sensitive, is becoming more and more important. So we continue to see now with an expanded platform to have similar growth -- organic growth rates that we did this past year, which I said we're, let's say, upper teens to touching into the 20% category. And we'll update you as we go through the progress, but we're really happy in terms of already the synergies that we're getting from that, putting the 2 teams together.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo.
Eric Luebchow: So I wanted to touch on the data center business. Barry, I think you said that the target leasing outlook is 50 megawatts for this year. So that probably means you had pretty good visibility and some larger hyperscale wins. So maybe you could talk about or maybe disaggregate that outlook into larger hyperscale versus more traditional enterprise sales. And then on the return side, any changes in the return targets on the higher capital spend this year based on any supply chain or inflationary impacts in the data center space?
William Meaney: So let me -- I'll start with the leasing activity, and then Barry can comment further. But I think the -- you're right, I mean, that with the hyperscale folks, you do have more visibility. I mean, I think you can expect that the retail side or the colo side would be -- continue to be kind of in the teens of megawatts a year. So we like that business. We continue to see the same kind of deal flow or pipeline coming in on that side. And then the thing we're also very excited about is that a few years ago, we were relatively a new entrant in the hyperscale. And clearly, if you look at the results this past year, almost hitting 50 megawatts, and this year, we're guiding to another 50 megawatts. We're making really, really good progress. So we're starting to look more like, what I would say, a typical industry player in the data center space where you're getting like kind of 60% to 70% of the volume, maybe even a little bit more from hyperscale and the rest from colocation and retail.
Barry Hytinen: The only thing I would add is that while we see some level -- as you've heard from other industry participants, some level of inflation in cost, we also see very good pricing. And so we expect mark-to-market to be flat to up, if not better than that. We are seeing good pricing in terms of new deals. And we feel very well positioned. And I'm pleased to be able to say we expect the margin to be rising year-on-year. So thanks for the question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Barry, I was hoping you could give us an organic constant currency revenue growth for the '22 guide. I definitely heard you that ITRenew is $450 million of revs and FX is $60 million headwind. I assume this is still a little bit more revenue from other acquisitions that you did as well. And so if you could just kind of total it out for us and give us organic revenue growth for the '22 guide, that would be helpful.
Barry Hytinen: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. I'll disaggregate it for you. So you would be working with $450 million for ITRenew. The net of all of our other M&A activity in 2021 is about $25 million of benefit year-on-year. So not a lot. And you might be -- might have been thinking that, that would be higher, and I'll just remind folks that we did sell our software escrow business back in June. So that's a headwind to revenue, and then we bought a small data center in Frankfurt and we also did the small acquisition in the -- relatively small acquisition in the Mid East. So the net of all that is about $25 million year-on-year. And it's kind of first quarter, it's about $5 million, and it's about $5 million in the second quarter and with the balance kind of in the third. From an EBITDA standpoint, because as we talked about before that, that software escrow business was a high profit margin business, you're only looking for about $5 million of EBITDA from all of that incremental revenue. And then the FX is about $60 million of a headwind, that's as of yesterday. So -- and that's about $25 million or so of EBITDA headwind. So if you work through that, that would get you to your organic. It's very strong, by the way. And it's benefited by the fact that we have very strong visibility on pricing.  And the services side that Bill mentioned, we're growing strength to strength with our digital solutions probably being up at least 20% on top of 20% and the data center business and the storage area there being up in the 20s. So we feel very well positioned. Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from Sheila McGrath from Evercore.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. Bill, you called out a number of wins in your prepared remarks with government contracts and other customers. I was wondering if you can help us understand if the legacy traditional storage offering was part of the mix with any of those contracts. Or just what were the different components of Iron Mountain's business offering that helped you win that business?
William Meaney: Thank you, Sheila, for the question. And actually, I just got back from a trip to D.C. a couple of weeks ago. So the -- I would say it's kind of yes and no. Yes, in terms of the brand, right, because we have been a very trusted partner operating government-approved facilities for their physical storage for many years, as you know. And I think that brand recognition with the U.S. federal government has been extremely strong. That being said, the recent contracts I've been highlighting have been us actually providing digital service, auto classification analytics around some of these documents, also taking documents that are already in digital form that we're not actually storing on behalf of the federal government. So more and more going forward is that we're providing purely digital services. But I wouldn't underestimate the halo effect of the understanding of the brand and the trust and the security associated with working with Iron Mountain.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Bill, I think you've missed it if I didn't ask you a question about the RIM volume changes quarter-to-quarter. So I want to bring that up a little. There's a slight decline, and it looks like there was also 30 basis points of sequential decline in records retention. Were there any strong document destruction projects in the quarter? Or how should I be thinking about that in terms of just the movements quarter between quarter?
William Meaney: So first of all, I guess -- I thought you were asleep this morning, so I notice someone had taken your voice. No. So first of all, we're really pleased with the progression in terms of our records management business because if you notice that actually, sequentially, it's actually getting stronger, not weaker. And as I said, the slight negative drag on the records management business is really a second derivative effect. And as that kind of wears through, you start seeing a stabilization. And indeed, we're actually seeing an improvement in the trends in the records management. And in terms of total volume, physical storage volume, is our other areas of storage and adjacent business areas and consumer more than offset those flattening trends. I would say -- the only other thing I would say is that, yes, you're right, and you've been watching this business for a long time. You always see a little bit of an uptick in destructions in the fourth quarter because, generally, it's kind of like people do their spring housecleaning in our business as they kind of do their fall housekeeping. So we do see some -- just generally. But that's like every year. I didn't -- we didn't see more of that or less of that this year. And Barry, you might want to talk more specifically about the trend.
Barry Hytinen: Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Shlomo, and thanks again for the question, is I usually look at the records management retention rate on a year-over-year basis as opposed to sequentially because of the points that Bill was just making. And if you look at that versus the year-end 2020 number, it's actually up 40 basis points. So we feel very good about where the record retention rate finished the year. And the only other thing I guess I would add is if you look at the storage rental revenue growth on an organic basis, it was up 3.6% in the quarter. And that is -- 2/3 of that is coming out of our core and 1/3 of that is coming up from data center in terms of that improvement in terms of organic revenue growth. And when you look -- disaggregate the 2/3 coming out of our core, it's actually both pricing as well as improved volume trends because, as you know, the organic volume on a year -- full year basis was actually up. So we feel very good about where things are trending. We expect our volume to be consistent to up again in 2022. Thank you for the question.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo.
Eric Luebchow: So I just wanted to touch on the capital allocation outlook for this year. So Barry, you said that leverage should be within the range by year-end, but just wanted to know what was embedded in that. Do you expect to do any incremental acquisitions? Should we expect any additional asset sales as a funding mechanism? And then based on the strong AFFO per share outlook, you'll be in the mid-60s from a payout ratio. At what point would you consider starting to grow the dividend again?
Barry Hytinen: Okay. Thanks, Eric. A few points in there. Let me answer those. We aren't embedding any additional M&A in our guidance for this year. So we shouldn't be planning for that. As we said before, we're very committed to our leverage range, and we'll get back into that leverage range and the year within it. In terms of additional things to put in the model, I would say I would be planning for something like $150 million of capital recycling. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the cap rates there are phenomenal. We've seen cap rates even sub-4. So it's very, very good environment out there. And as a reminder, we're generally doing sale leaseback transactions that are very favorable, in our opinion, because we essentially have ownership-like interest in the building while monetizing it at these great cap rates. And that enables us to really just be very strategic about the capital allocation plan. In terms of your question about AFFO payout ratio, you're right, in our guidance, we'd be just above the mid-60s by the end of the year. And we've said repeatedly that our target is for that to be kind of the low to mid-60s over the long term. And at that point, we'd be looking at a dividend increase. So in fact, we'd be almost approaching sort of the REIT minimum under certain scenarios under that -- at that level. And therefore, you probably would be expecting dividends through in the future to be rising with the same rate as AFFO per share.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Iron Mountain, Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question you may press [Operator Instructions]. To withdraw your question, please press star and 2. We will limit analysts to one question and you can rejoin the queue. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sarah Berry of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Sarah Berry: Thank you, Chris. Good morning and welcome to our Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO, and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. After prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations.  All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2, and our annual report on Form 10-K for discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Meaney: Thank you, Sarah, and thank you all for taking time to join us. We are pleased to have delivered strong performance in the third quarter reflecting our broad offerings, deep customer relationships, resilient business model, and the strength of our team. This can be easily highlighted by our 7.4% total organic revenue growth. This strong overall organic revenue growth has been delivered by continued strength in our storage business, as well as double-digit growth in our new and existing digital offerings, including data center inside our digital transformation services, and IT asset disposition or I-Tech.  Throughout the pandemic, including the most recent challenges of the Delta variant, our Mountaineers around the world have truly stepped up. Each and every day to put our customers first with a focus on growth. I'm both proud and humbled by this incredibly talented and dedicated team and what we've been able to accomplish through such a challenging time. Today's results, including our strong organic revenue growth exceeding 7%, is a direct result of their dedication in serving our customers in ways they need to keep their businesses growing. We have a lot to cover today, so I'll start with a brief overview of our results and key business drivers.  During the third quarter, we reported revenue of over $1.1 billion EBITDA of over -- of EBITDA of $418 million, both of which are new record highs. Our results are fueled by increased demand for our services across key markets and continued positive momentum in the business. Our digital services in iPad business continue to build on its prior performance and deliver almost 20% growth in the quarter. Today, we're proud to say that 95% of the Fortune 1000 are among the 225,000 of our loyal customer base. We have a growing footprint of more than 1,460 facilities and with our recent expansion in the Middle East, we are now present in 63 countries. And we are supported by 25,000 Mountaineers across the globe. As we look ahead to future opportunities, there is no doubt the world has changed. But, we're making the improvements to our business today to serve the changed needs of the world tomorrow. That is why we have built, evolved, and expanded our trusted relationships with our customers as not only the leading storage platform of physical assets, but also the business services partner to support data center co-location, information security, data insights, Secure IT Asset Disposition and business process management.  With this focus, we have expanded our total addressable market to more than $80 billion. Together with our strong customer relationships, focus on innovation, and 70-year heritage, we are operating from a unique position of strength. Now let's turn to some of the exciting events during the quarter. You'll hear us talk a lot about customer - centricity here at Iron Mountain. And when we help our customers not only protect their information, but also unlock new revenue opportunities, as well as cost efficiencies. That's a big win for our customers, and ultimately, for us. We were proud to be featured as one of the winners of Google's first-ever Google Cloud Customer Award for Financial Services for our work with a large financial institution. This is a great follow-on award from a couple of years ago when we won their machine learning artificial intelligence partner of the year. But this award, we leveraged our expertise in mortgage document processing to train machine learning models to automate document classification and data extraction and validation, deliver advanced exception management and unlock value for our customers.  In line with our automation first mindset, we utilize Google's document understanding for AI algorithms in Iron Mountain's insight platform to identify, classify, extract and validate loan data to support authenticity, accuracy, and completeness. As a result of our services, the customer has seen efficiency improvements including a 25% post-closing cost reduction, increased scalability, a shortened cycle time, and increased responsiveness to market demand, among other enhancements. We are not only proud of our work with this financial services customer, but are also dedicated to continuing to enrich our customer's ability to protect and preserve their high-value assets in -- and in turn, a system with gaining market share in their businesses through higher end-customer satisfaction. I'm also pleased to report that Iron Mountain received the JP Morgan Chase Strategic Diverse Gold Supplier Award for our commitment to supplier diversity and the contributions of our very own supplier diversity program. Together with our fellow Gold Suppliers, we have collectively agreed to increase spending with diverse owned businesses and have set ambitious goals over the next three years. As part of this, we are on track to achieve our goal of $63 million in supplier diversity spend by the end of 2021. This is not just about our diversity goals, but it is also about helping our customers like JPMorgan Chase and our fellow Gold Suppliers to drive improvements in supplier diversity, which we recognize is important for all communities in which we operate.  By working together, we're having a far greater impact than any one company can achieve alone. I would now like to highlight our recent win working together with General Dynamics. You will recall we have been speaking for some time about the potential for our services inside the U.S. Federal Government. Whilst the transformation of the federal government has taken some time, we have seen over the past year major growth in our business across a number of governmental agencies. This growth is due not only to the residents that our products are having with the government and assisting them on their own transformation paths, but also to the work our government team has done in partnership with the likes of General Dynamics. This partnership is already resulting in a 3-year Iron Mountain contract worth $23 million to help the Department of Veteran's Affairs with their digital transformation in order to serve better our U.S. soldiers. As part of this initial project, we're helping the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs digitally process an estimated 15 million official military personnel files. Through digital transformation, this agency is taking a proactive approach to provide greater access to personnel files, as well as streamline the overall claims process in order to get veterans the benefits they deserve. In addition to our success with General Dynamics, I would like to highlight another win in our global RIM segment. We've had a long-standing relationship with a major global financial institution for over 20 years, and we have recently expanded our relationship with them, by signing a new 10-year global contract in which they committed to renew and consolidate all global records in data management business with us.  Through this work, along with our global scale, we won an additional two-year contract for data restoration and migration services. We will provide the customer with clear, detailed information from backup tapes spanning 11 years, which will help them make informed decisions around data deletion, retention, and remediation. Ultimately, we will reduce and enhance data management and compliance. Finally, turning to data center, we are well on track to exceeding our bookings target of 30 megawatts this year. In fact, through October, we stand at 24 megawatts in addition to our continued growth in bookings this quarter, we closed on the acquisition of our new data center in Frankfurt. When we purchased the new Frankfurt data center, we inherited over 2 megawatts of existing clients, and we have expansion capacity of 8 megawatts for a total of over 10 megawatts on that site.  Already in this quarter, we have signed 1.6 megawatts of new leases for this site and have a strong pipeline which should absorb the remaining capacity over the next 2 to 3 years. I should also add that our first in purpose-built data center in Frankfurt is up and running and a tenant which leases the entire 27 megawatts is moving in this quarter. With this transaction in Frankfurt, we now have a total potential capacity in Europe of more than a 107 megawatts, which provides access to important interconnection markets for new and existing customers looking for reliable, flexible and secure data center locations across the Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and London markets. Even with our rapid growth, sustainability remains at the core of how we offer data center capacity. Iron Mountain continues to source more than a 100% of its energy used for data centers from renewable energy.  Moreover, as we announced in April, we took a significant step forward in the development of enhanced solutions for purchasing renewable energy by entering into an agreement to track the hourly load. I'm proud to announce that this September, we were able to report on our performance for the first half of the year for our datacenters in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey that are benefiting from this agreement. Over the past several months, we have taken definitive steps towards a truly carbon-free energy supply.  Not just by offsetting our carbon footprint by purchasing and reselling renewables, but by matching renewable energy in the very grids in which we operate. We are the first company to join Google to adopt the 24/7 carbon-free energy goal, and we became a founding signatory to the new UN Clean Energy Compact being released at COP26 this week. We can already publish 24/7 carbon-free energy performance at 3 of our campuses, becoming the 1st large co-location data center provider with this capability. We recognize that we are an important component of our clients energy footprint and we will continue to take every opportunity to minimize our environmental impact on their behalf. The awards and successes I outlined today are just a few among the various wins Iron Mountain has achieved this quarter. As we continue to deliver accelerated growth at IRM, in spite of the continued impact of COVID on some of our traditional service areas, I am confident that our resilient business model expanded product portfolio, customer first culture, and strategic transformation will continue to deliver strong sales growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill. And thank you for joining us. The third quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend, we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in service revenue, reflecting accelerating rates of growth driven by the new service offerings Bill discussed. Our core physical storage business performed well, and we are seeing continued strength in our growth areas. Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.13 billion grew 9%. Total organic revenue increased 7.4% year-over-year.  As an example of the momentum we are building on a 2-year basis, our organic revenue growth continued to accelerate in the quarter. Organic service revenue increased $61 million or 18%. Our team drove strong growth in both Global Digital Solutions business and Secure IT Asset Disposition. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3% with continued benefit from pricing and positive trends in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $418 million an increase of $42 million from last year. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team drove improved margin performance, despite the stronger U.S. dollar. AFFO $263 million or $0.90 on a per-share basis, up 47 million dollars and $0.15 respectively from the third quarter of last year. Turning to segment performance.  In the third quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $996 million, an increase of 74 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 6% The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 2.7% or 1.8% on an organic basis. This performance reflects an acceleration in growth as compared to the last few quarters. Growth was driven by pricing and volume. With positive volume trends in the Mid East deal that Bill mentioned, total physical volume achieved a new all-time record of 744 million cubic feet. We are pleased with the underlying trends, and continue to expect total volume on an organic basis to be flat to modestly up for the full year.  Our traditional services business continue to recover from the pandemic with revenue growing 14% year-over-year, all be at still down 4% from the levels achieved in 2019 reflecting the continued COVID impact. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $443 million, an increase of $49 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 180 basis points year-over-year as a result of strong operating leverage and improved service margins. Turning to our global datacenter business, our team booked 9 megawatts in the quarter. And through the end of the third quarter, we have booked at 22 megawatts.  With our strong and building pipeline and the additional contracts we've already signed this quarter, we are confident in our ability to exceed our full-year guidance of 30 megawatts. In terms of revenue as we projected, growth accelerated sharply to 22% year-over-year. In light of our strong performance year-to-date and prior-year bookings, we now expect full-year revenue growth of at least mid-teens percent, exceeding our prior projections. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% was consistent with the expectations we shared on our last call and driven by Buildout services at our Frankfurt facility. Turning to Project Summit, this quarter, the team delivered $38 million of the incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. We continue to expect year-on-year benefits from summit of $160 million with another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $138 million of which $100 million was growth, and $38 million was recurring. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4 times slightly better than our projection. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4 and 1/2 to 5 and 1/2 times. For 2021, we expect to exit the year at levels at or below the third quarter.  From a cash cycle perspective, I would like to highlight that our team drove a two-day improvement from last year and specifically call out that our Days Sales Outstanding are at the best level they've been at in several years. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January. Turning to our outlook. With the ongoing pandemic and where we are in the year, I feel it will be helpful to provide our view explicitly for this quarter. We expect total revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percentage range year-over-year in the fourth quarter.  For EBITDA, we expect percentage growth to be in the range of low double-digit to low teens year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect year over year AFFO growth in excess of 30% in the fourth quarter. As you may remember, last year we had an elevated level of maintenance capex in the fourth quarter as we caught up from pandemic-driven delays. On a more normalized level of capex spend last year, this implies at least 20% growth in AFFO in the fourth quarter of 2021. In summary, our team is executing well, our pipeline is growing, and momentum continues to build across our business. Our addressable market continues to expand and we feel confident in our ability to drive growth. We feel well-positioned and look forward to updating you on our progress following the fourth quarter. And with that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. We will limit analysts to one question and you can then rejoin the queue. Our first question is from Sheila McGrath of Evercore, please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath: I guess god morning. Bill and Barry. I've gotten questions from investors. that bottom line, growth, and margin improvement has benefited from Project Summit. And that benefit will be less of a factor going forward. Can you outline what revenue growth opportunities you are positive about for Iron Mountain looking out the next few years? And a related question to that is, can you also outline how you're able to effectively present such a broad offering of products to your customers when it appears there be different context at the -- at the customers for storage versus data centers versus insight.
Bill Meaney: Good morning, Sheila. So I'll start with strategically in where the product portfolio is going and then let Barry comment a little bit more on the nuts and bolts in terms of margin. So thanks for the question. I think, first -- I think part of Project Summit, you've seen that show up in the record high EBITDA margin that we have this quarter, so thank you for the call out on that. And I think that that's an ongoing benefit that we'll have. That EBITDA margin may move up and down depending on the product mix and it comes to your product portfolio question. On the product portfolio, a part of Summit that you haven't seen directly, in other words it isn't in the margin, is we've also taken a lot of benefit of Project Summit and reinvested in the business.  So besides actually driving the margin improvement that we printed today, we've also reinvested in the business and that's really what's driven that total addressable market going from $10 billion to $80 billion that we've highlighted the last few quarters. And part of that $80 billion of new total addressable market is the almost 20% growth that we've seen in digital services, which is primarily our insight driven digital platform, together with IT Asset Disposal business.  Those are some of the new areas that I think you're highlighting behind your question. So we actually see -- that business is growing strong double-digits and we can see that continue. You take that on top of the growth and the continued acceleration in growth in our data center businesses so we're well on track to exceed our upgraded guidance last quarter of 30 megawatts of bookings for this year. Then I do -- we do expect to see -- continue with levels of revenue growth like we've seen the last few quarters. Because this growth that we've seen in the topline, whilst we have seen -- luckily, some recovery in terms of our traditional service business. I think it's fair to say that we've seen an acceleration in terms of our revenue growth that's really driven by the new product areas and less from what I would call a rebound from historically low activity due to COVID. I don't know, Barry if you want to comment a little bit around the margin?
Barry Hytinen: Hi, Sheila. Good morning and thanks for the question. I would say when we look outlook and you look at where our margin has been recently, where it's going to continue to go, We have very favorable trends in pricing. I think that you will continue to see at least the level of pricing activity going forward as we've seen here over the last year or so. There's some macro trends there that are both positive for us I think on a pricing benefit. If you look at our data center business of the margin, as we talked about has on a transitory basis been a little bit lower than where we expect it to go over time.  That business is obviously dealing with some fit-out on our Frankfurt facility, which is transitory here in the third and the fourth quarter. And as we move forward, we see that margin expanding. So that's obviously a very nice secular tailwind to the business. And then I would say when you look at ongoing productivity, we continue to see that. So while Summit has been incredibly beneficial to the business and we'll have more Summit benefit year-on-year next year, we certainly see the opportunity for additional productivity. The only other thing I'll say is, as you know, since you follow the company well, we've had couple of relatively large sale leaseback transactions over the last 12 months. And while I expect to continue to do a relative amount of capital recycling, that's been a big headwind on a year-over-year basis. So if that comes down to a more -- a little more normalized level going forward, that's also a benefit.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The next question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. As it relates to your overall growth portfolio, can you provide a sense of how quickly it grew and also discuss examples of recent success and traction outside of your Data Centers business?
Bill Meaney: Yes. Thanks, George. If you look at the 20% growth that we called out this quarter, or just under 20% growth, that's all non Data Center. So that is the -- what we call ITAD or IT Asset Disposal business and we've won some recent large global contracts for that. Mainly for corporates that are trying to make sure that they both manage the secured destruction of any information that happens to be on their devices or hardware, as well as making sure that they can be managed in an environmentally friendly way. That's one part of it. And the other part of it is just the rapid growth that we've seen in adoption of our InSight platform and overall digitization of people's information.  So that's everything from people taking advantage to say, okay, when they're retrieving documents on a very simple basis, is we want to actually retrieve them electronically through the InSight platform where they can access those from a secure platform in the cloud, to Digital Mailroom, which is beyond the typical mail-room employee arbitrage model, but again allowing people to have not only access to the information that comes through their mail room, but to be able to operate in a hybrid work fashion. In other words, where people can work from home and the office and always have access to their information.  To even some, what I would call larger, more complex deals, I mean, I just returned from the Middle East about a month ago, where we're working with a government there and their National Archives to help them digitize everything about the way the government works. And that's again using the insight platform. But it's not just the insight platform, but auto classification of the documents to create metadata so that they can actually share the information digitally to the right people with the right security level in a way that can be managed for the long term. So it's multifaceted thing, but those are the areas that are really driving a lot of the top line growth that we see today. And as well as our data center business. I mean, obviously the data center business with the types of bookings that we have, will continue to drive increasing levels of growth. I should -- but I should not miss how it is, the underlying growth of the more traditional side of the business, mostly driven by pricing, continues to the chug along nicely.
Operator: Thank you sir. The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mr. Rosenbaum, your line is open. Just check that you're not muted.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Sorry. I was muted. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit about the storage business and some of the puts and takes that went through it. It seems like there is some other -- with an acquisition something added about 10 million cubic feet. You guys are getting pricing. There's some organic growth. But when I go to the total revenue from adjusted storage when including the terminations and permanent withdrawal fees, it's really flattish sequentially. And so I was just want to ask you, what are some of the puts and takes that you might have seen on a sequential basis because I think you commented last quarter expecting some volumes to come in that will pent up from COVID-19. And was just wondering how this is translating into revenue as you build through the year.
Barry Hytinen: Hi Shlomo, it's Barry, thanks for the question. I will try to unpack that for you. So you are right. We did close on the transaction in the Mid East, which we think is a great platform for us to continue to grow in that region together with our existing business. Now I will note that that closed very late in the quarter in the second half of September so really had almost no benefit to the quarter in terms of the financials, albeit it is in our cube as you note. So that didn't really help the sequential. On the pricing, you might recall that the beginning of the year and then again on the quarter call, I mentioned that all of the pricing we had planned for was already set as of March or April.  And so the sequential benefit on pricing was not much and we weren't planning for it. And then the other thing I'll call out, as you think about storage sequentially is we did divest the software escrow business in June, second -- first part of June last quarter. And so the sequential move from the second to the third on storage, that was completely storage business. So it's about $6 or $7 million of sequential decline due to that being in the second quarter, but not in the third quarter. So all in, we feel quite good. In fact, I'll be -- I'll tell you that the storage revenue performed better than we were planning on a sequential basis. And as it relates to the point about pent-up demand, you'll recall last quarter we did note that -- and that was in some of the economies, particularly in Asia and I'd say with the -- some of the COVID and Delta variant and various other elements that occurred in some of those markets, we continue to have a pretty good-sized backlog. Bill, anything you want to add?
Bill Meaney: No. I think that's -- covers that.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Then the next question is from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch upon fairly topical area in data centers today. A lot of talk in the industry about cost inflation in terms of development costs along with supply chain challenges and getting new equipment. Maybe you could just give us your perspective on what you're seeing in your footprint. Whether that's -- any development cost, inflation, any development delays in terms of timing. And also the impact of higher power cost, particularly in Europe. And then from a broader pricing perspective, do you think that this environment may be supportive of industry pricing moving upwards in the next couple of years as we work through all these challenges? Thanks.
Bill Meaney: Thanks, Eric. I appreciate the question. So 2 or 3 points that I'll cover in your question. I think the first bit is that, I would say that for 2022 in terms of supply chain, we're pretty well covered just because of the lead time. But to your point is, we have seen I would say 10 to 12 weeks increase in supply chain or lead time on some of the MEP and related equipment, and even in Including steel in some markets. I think to your point is, we are seeing a lengthening of the supply chain, but I would say for 2022, we're well covered because that's already been in training committed contracts to actually do that build-out.  And we're -- now we're already looking at 2023 and we're factoring in that extended lead time for some of that equipment in our planning. So the good news -- the bad news is that the lead times have increased. The good news is that we're well covered for 2022, so we've got the time to make sure we incorporate that in our planning for 2023. So that's -- I would say one aspect. And in terms of the increase in the prices -- so we're pretty well hedged for the 2022 commitments that we have because those are contracts that we've already lead. So we are seeing an increase in inflation in some of those raw materials. That being said because this is a business where the cost of construction is well known and quite transparent to our customer base, is we see trends and we expect that to continue. Our pricing will go in line with the cost of build. So I think we're kind of naturally hedged given the transparency of these businesses. In terms of the power cost is that the -- again, we're pretty well covered for this year, but we have seen an uptick in pricing in pretty much all the markets as you -- as everyone's noticed. And I would say that -- first part is, I would say about 60% of our portfolio in 2022 will be pretty much straight power pass-through, so we don't have any exposure in terms of the power costs. The remainder, most of that is still on long-term -- we've contracted for the power long-term. So think of our business has north of 70% naturally hedged, and the part that isn't is is up for renewal during the course of 2022, or a big part of it is. So we don't really see power affecting us in any material way. And in fact, we see continued upward progression in terms of our EBITDA margins as we get into 2022. But thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan, please go ahead.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, this is Alex on for Andrew Steinerman. Our question is regarding your guidance. Your guidance for high-single-digit percentage growth in revenue and low double-digit to low teens percentage growth in EBITDA for fourth quarter appears to imply an adjusted EBIDTA margin of about 36.5%. Can you confirm that we're doing the math there right? Maybe speak to some of the drivers behind that? Thank you.
Barry Hytinen: Hi, Alex. It's Barry. Thanks for the question. Why don't I help you with both the revenue and the EBITDA the way we are thinking about it. So in the fourth quarter, you right, we said about high single-digit. So let's say that's 8% or 9% on the revenue side just to give you a couple of the puts and takes. We have a -- the dollar is stronger as we have less than a point of FX benefit year-on-year, and a similar amount from M&A less than a point because just as a reminder, as I mentioned to Shlomo, we divested that software Escrow business in the second quarter. And so as a result, it's not much M&A benefit. So that leaves you with about call it 7% of organic constant currency growth.  And with the strength of the Data Center business, that'll contribute probably 1.5 points alone because that business is performing very well and so you should be working with your model and think like 20 plus percent growth in the fourth quarter from our Data Center business. The balance would be coming from low-single-digit growth in our storage rental revenue. And that'll be with good pricing contribution. Course the remainder is as Bill 's highlighted on the call, the very nice growth we're seeing out of our Digital Solutions and SITAD business. On the EBITDA stand side, we're looking at low double-digit to low -- sorry, mid-teens growth. So let's say that's 13 or so percent just to keep the midpoint there. For the purpose of this discussion, that's about, call it, $48 million of year-on-year increase. FX is a very small contribution, almost nothing, and M&A would be actually a net negative on a year-over-year basis in light of the escrow business was a very high-margin. And so think about data center as having a modest increase in margin sequentially still affected by the fit-out in Frankfurt. So a few million of benefit to EBITDA from data center.  Our Summit is -- our Summit Project is doing phenomenally well and the team is executing very well. You'll probably see $30+ million of year-on-year benefit in the quarter from that. And then of course, pricing will continue to be a very strong contributor. And the services margin, I expect to continue to improve which you've been seeing throughout the year. So naturally, there are some offsets with sale leaseback, as I mentioned earlier, and higher levels of commission in light of the very good trajectory the team is driving on top line. So we're feeling very good about the fourth quarter as we sit here today, and look forward to talking to you about it in 90 days. Thank you. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, sir. This concludes our question and answer session and the Iron Mountain third quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greer Aviv: Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On today’s call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO; and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including our Q2 outperformance, the increased momentum in the business, our updated outlook for 2021 financial guidance, the continued growth in our data center business and the strong performance in our growth areas. After our prepared remarks, we’ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today’s earnings materials contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today’s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliation to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. I hope you and your families are safe and well. This morning we reported record second quarter financial results with revenue of more than $1.1 billion and EBITDA of $406 million. This strong performance in both Q2 in the first half of the year reflects the breadth and depth of our products and solutions and the strength of our deep customer relationships. Our second quarter results especially reflect increased demand for our services across our key markets in is based upon these strong results in the increased momentum in the business that has caused us to increase the midpoint of our financial guidance as well has increased the expected bookings in our data center business. As we celebrate and honor Iron Mountain’s 70th anniversary this month, I am extremely proud of what our team has accomplished in growing our relationships with our large and diverse customer base in spite of the continued challenges due to COVID. Our Mountaineers across the globe have conquered every obstacle with tenacity, and an innovative mindset all with a focus on accelerating growth and services to assist our customers. Before we dive into our record results and the positive momentum in our business, I want to take a moment to reflect on the current situation with the pandemic in new variants, still wrecking havoc in many parts of the world. In addition to operational complexities, we’re also dealing with the realities of a workplace and the world changed forever by the COVID-19 pandemic. At Iron Mountain, we’re thinking how we can move forward instead of getting back to normal. All whilst remaining diligent to ensure the physical and mental health as well as the overall safety of our teams, their families, and our customers. As I mentioned earlier, this year we celebrate 70 years of Iron Mountain. It’s a legacy with a rich inspired past, which continues inspiring the future. Since that day on August 24, 1951, we have built, evolved and expanded our trusted relationship with our customers to include not just the leading storage platform of physical assets, but now includes a rapidly increasing range of business services. These new services are centered around data center co-location, information security, data, insights, IT asset disposition in business process management. And today, with this broadened portfolio of services and storage capabilities, we have become an innovative and global leader in our field with more than 225,000 customers including more than 95% of the Fortune 1000, a global footprint of more than 1,450 facilities with a presence in 58 countries and 24,000 dedicated Mountaineers across the globe. And doing all this within an energy sustainable way, with a 100% of our data centers powered by renewable energy. Many of the things about us have changed in 70 years. What hasn’t changed is our core values and commitment to building and delivering on the trust our customers have come to count on. Over the last two quarters we shared with you that we now have an expanded total addressable market or TAM of more than $80 billion. And against that expanded TAM, we’ve identified the building blocks for growth that will enable future growth and success. And in fact, you can already see evidence of this expansion through our year-on-year digital service revenue growth together with secure IT Asset Disposition or ITAD. In this quarter versus a year ago, these business lines have grown over 37% resulting in $25 million of incremental growth. I want to highlight a few examples, which illustrate our progress in helping our customers through utilizing new technologically enabled approaches and products to not only protect, but unlocked value from what matters most to them. The first one I want to highlight is in Singapore with a multinational banking and financial services corporation. We won a $750,000 annual recurring revenue, digital mailroom contract over their current service provider. At first, the bank didn’t believe that Iron Mountain could solve this need for them as they had only known us for support – to support their storage and scanning requirements. However, the account came pursued the opportunity and highlighted Iron Mountain strengths utilizing a new technologically based approach, which allows us to assist in managing the very start of much of the information entering the bank while securely facilitating a hybrid office and home working model. As we are already this customers partner for business process outsourcing and processing much of the bank’s critical information. The mail room is a key additional service, which will yield further security and simplicity for the bank. Turning to another area representing part of our expanded TAM, I want to touch briefly on secure ITAD. Think of this as an area where we apply our highly secure chain of custody with a service that allows our customers to dispose securely in an environmentally responsible way their IT assets, which are at end of life. We have continued to see good momentum in our secure ITAD solution following a number of big wins last quarter. We won a deal with one of the world’s largest banks to recycle corporate laptops, monitors and outdated IT equipment across over 400 corporate offices, 4,000 conference rooms and 5,000 retail offices, which we expect to generate annual run rate revenues greater than $5 million. This is a valuable offering given our expertise in chain of custody and compliance, helping customers securely dispose of their IT equipment. Turning to our data center business. We want to share not only our continued growth in top and bottom line, but some recent exciting developments in the last month, which has led us to increase our guidance for expected 2021 leasing from 25 to 30 megawatts to over 30 megawatts, not including additional leasing expected from the recent acquisitions in Frankfurt and India. Our increased guidance around leasing activities and based upon the momentum have seen in the business in the first half of the year, as well as the pipeline. Today, we announced not only the 3.6 megawatts of new leases, we signed in the second quarter, but also a 6 megawatt lease with a new logo to our platform that was signed post Q2 in Northern Virginia. Taken together along with our strong results in Q1, we have recorded a total of 19 megawatts of new and expansion leases in the first seven months of the year. This is a great launching off point for the remainder of the year. And we feel confident we will achieve leasing activity above the top end of our original guidance. Turning back to Q2. It should be noted of the 3.6 megawatts we leased in the quarter and majority was in the retail and enterprise segments. This result in an attractive pricing for the quarter, which increased 14% sequentially. Our strongest markets in terms of new and expansion leasing were Phoenix, Singapore and Northern Virginia. Finally, in terms of development, you likely saw from our recent press releases our data center business is expanding rapidly in Europe. We have a new 27 megawatt Greenfield build in London, adjacent to our existing London one facility, as well as the pending acquisition of a multitenant co-location data center in Frankfurt. Taken together, this will increase our total potential capacity in Europe to more than 88 megawatts. And we’ll provide access to important interconnection markets for new and existing customers looking for a reliable, flexible and secure data center location. As always sustainability continues to be a top priority. And as part of our commitments, we will power our new buildings in London and Frankfurt with a 100% renewable energy. Before I hand the call over, I also wish to touch upon some new product areas, which are leading to more growth in our traditional storage areas. One of these newer product offerings is clean start, which is a service that helps customers navigate today’s changing workplace requirements from reconfiguring the office the social distancing to office closures, or moving to a more digital way of working. Since inception the clean start product has generated over $19 million in revenue and has uncovered $1.1 million net new cube over a three-year period. In 2020, we decided to expand clean start globally with all regions engaged and growing the program. Since taking the business globally, we have seen an acceleration in bookings specifically in the first half of 2021, clean start has delivered $5 million of new revenue or some 25% of the total revenue from this program since its inception three years ago. A specific customer example in this quarter includes a $1.8 million deal with a leading global hotel chain over the next five years. Due to challenges from the pandemic, the customer needed solutions to help with compliance and storage of materials. This customer has been with Iron Mountain for years at an individual hotel level and its corporate team saw the value in our scale, breadth of offerings, compliance expertise and risk reduction solutions. This prompted the decision to deploy our services across 103 hotels plus an additional 15 one-off sites as required. We were able to manage much more than just the record storage, also meeting the destruction needs and providing Image on Demand services, all of this being done company-wide at a scale unmatched by any other provider. Another example, which showcases our innovative new products, which drive records volume and services growth is Smart Sort. Our customers want to reduce costs and risks by defensively destroying records as they meet retention requirements, which is difficult to do if records are not stored by the destruction eligibility date. For example, many healthcare accounts store records by patient number or last date of visit and not by retention requirement. With Smart Sort, we organize the records by destruction date, so the customer knows what they can destroy and when. Our team understood a pervasive customer problem took a customer centric approach and proactively came up with a solution to solve it with Smart Sort. Just in the last year, we’ve had 10 healthcare vertical wins for Smart Sort with our most recent win with Johns Hopkins Medical Center. The agreement is a five-year term, which includes a $1.2 million Smart Sort move project, bringing in additional 160,000 cubic feet of inventory, representing over 4 million individual patient records. Reflecting some of these successes, total global volume grew to a record 733 million cubic feet this quarter. In spite of organic volume being down 10 basis points in the second quarter versus the first quarter, total global organic volume was up 1.6 million cubic feet in the first half of the year. And we continue to expect organic volume to be flat to slightly up for the full year. This expected organic volume together with continued strong price increases sets us up well for continued strength in organic storage revenue growth from our physical business areas. In closing, I want to say thank you to the 24,000 Mountaineers, who have done an outstanding job navigating through the pandemic. I’m extremely proud of their relentless dedication to each other and our customers. With a resilient business model, ongoing market share growth and strategic investments to transform the company, we are excited about the significant opportunities ahead of us, which continued to exceed even our ambitious targets. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us. The second quarter exceeded our expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Continuing the trend we have seen over the last few quarters, revenue continued to strengthen with a strong recovery in service revenue and activity levels. Our core physical storage business performed well and we are seeing great progress in our growth areas. Reflecting that progress and the outperformance in the first half, we increased the midpoint of our financial guidance. Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1, billion grew 14%, total organic revenue increased 10%. Organic service revenue increased $81 million or 26% and was ahead of our expectations. Our team drove strong growth in both our Global Digital Solutions business and Secure IT Asset Disposition. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.5% with continued benefit from pricing together with positive trends in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $406 million. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as the team delivered better than expected Project Summit savings together with the revenue beat. AFFO was $246 million or $0.85 on a per share basis. If you recall, last year’s the AFFO benefited from a $23 million tax refund, adjusting for this AFFO would have increased 8% year-over-year. As we mentioned on our prior earnings call, AFFO also reflects an increase in recurring CapEx as we catch up on some projects that were deferred during the pandemic. Our full year recurring CapEx guidance is unchanged. Turning to segment performance. In the second quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $993 million, an increase of $116 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 9.1%. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 1.9% or 1.6% on an organic basis. Growth was driven primarily by pricing and volume. We added about 4.5 million cubic feet from our acquisition in Indonesia, which closed during the quarter. Our traditional services business continued to recover from the pandemic with revenue growing 24% year-over-year and 4% from the first quarter. Our Global Digital Solutions business continued to display strong momentum, growing 24% year-over-year. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $430 million, an increase of $47 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 50 basis points year-over-year as a result of mix given the strong service revenue growth. Sequentially, EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points due to Project Summit benefits and the contribution from pricing. Turning to our Global Data Center business, where the team continues to perform exceptionally well. We booked at 3.6 megawatts in the quarter and through the first half, we have booked at 12.6 megawatts. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we signed a 6 megawatt lease in Northern Virginia. Based on the year-to-date performance and the strength of our pipeline, we increased our full year leasing target to more than 30 megawatts, which would represent a 23% increase in bookings. In terms of revenue, as we projected growth accelerated sharply to 15% year-over-year. We continue to plan for full year revenue growth in the range of low double digits to approaching mid-teens. The combination of our strong prior year bookings and the team’s leasing performance year-to-date provides high visibility. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.4% increased 60 basis points from the first quarter and was ahead of our expectations. As compared to our prior outlook, the improvement was driven primarily by timing related to the Frankfurt build-out we discussed last quarter, which has been modestly delayed. As a result, we now expect more of the work associated with that project to occur in the second half, which will result in a temporary impact on segment margins on the order of three points relative to the second quarter level. Turning to Project Summit. This quarter, the team delivered $42 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. With the strength of the team’s performance year-to-date, we now expect year-on-year benefits from Summit to approach $160 million with another $50 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $136 million, with $100 million was growth and $36 million was recurring. Turning to capital recycling. As we have said before, we view the market for industrial assets as highly attractive, as a means to supplement our growth capital. With that backdrop in the second quarter, we upsized our recycling program and generated approximately $203 million of proceeds. Year-to-date, we have generated $215 million in proceeds compared to our previous guidance of $125 million. With our strong data center development pipeline, we are now expecting to generate full year proceeds of approximately $250 million. Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $2.1 billion of liquidity. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times slightly better than our projection and down from both last year and last quarter. This marks our lowest leverage level since year-end 2017. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range and estimate we will exit the year at levels similar to the second quarter. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October. Turning to our outlook. Today, we are pleased to increase the midpoint of our 2021 financial guidance. There are three factors driving the improved projections. First, operational performance in the second quarter was better than expected and we have good momentum in our key growth areas. Second, we have identified additional benefits from Project Summit, primarily related to opportunities that our commercial team has been able to uncover. And third, we have acquired a small records management business in Morocco that will add about $5 million in revenue. Conversely, as compared to our prior guidance, there are two headwinds I would call out. First, we divested our Intellectual Property Management business in early June. Compared to our prior guidance, this represents a reduction of approximately $20 million of revenue and $15 million of EBITDA. Second, since May, the stronger U.S. dollar is more of a headwind by nearly $20 million for revenue and $7 million for EBITDA. For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue of $4.415 billion to $4.515 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.6 billion to $1.635 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents growth of 8% and EBITDA growth of 10%. We now expect AFFO to be in the range of $970 million to $1.05 billion and AFFO per share of $3.33 to $3.45. At the midpoint, this represents 11% and 10% growth respectively. Our guidance assumes global organic physical volume will be flat to slightly positive versus last year and with continued benefits and pricing, we anticipate low single digit growth in total organic storage revenue. For services, we expect to maintain positive revenue growth through remainder of the year. With the ongoing pandemic, we believe it is helpful to share our short-term expectations. For the third quarter, we expect revenue and EBITDA to both increase approximately $10 million sequentially from the second quarter levels. We expect AFFO to be slightly in excess of $250 million in the third quarter. In summary, our team is executing well. We have seen positive trends in the macro environment and our pipeline continues to build. The momentum we had entering the year has strengthened, our addressable market continues to expand and we feel confident in our ability to drive growth. We feel well positioned and look forward to updating you on our progress following the third quarter. And with that operator, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath: Yes, good morning. The services rebound was very strong in the quarter, and I understand it’s based on some new products, which you called out. Just wondering if there’s more leverage as people returned to the office in some of your services businesses that have been held back from the pandemic or people working from a home. Is there more leverage for those businesses to increase as people return to office?
Bill Meaney: Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question. So first, I appreciate the call out it. We’re really pleased with the organic service revenue approaching 26% in this quarter, which we thought was just a very strong result. And as you pointed out, that was really driven by a lot of our new digital solutions, which was well north of 30% growth if you take ITAD and digital services combined. I think your question on the traditional service side is a good one, because what we’ve seen actually is an increase in the backlog of incoming cube, which quite frankly, we haven’t been able to get at in some countries because of continued rolling lockdowns or intermittent lockdowns. So we do expect has some of the lockdowns get ease that on the traditional service lines that – we know that there’s a backlog of incoming cube that we haven’t been able to access the offices for. So I think there will be some in the medium term in that area, how big it’s hard to judge right now.
Operator: The next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My question is on Project Summit, you mentioned that you’re realizing additional benefits from Project Summit. That’s causing you to raise your guidance and you talked about expectations of $160 million savings with another $50 million next year. So how much of the upside in savings represent the pull forward from future periods? Or would you say, this is like an increase in total savings from Project Summit. And can you just sort of map out the entire timeline of when you would expect to realize the full amount of project savings over the next couple of years. Maybe related to that the Project Summit savings, how does your increased investment into growth initiatives impact the flow-through of Project Summit savings in terms of margin expansion opportunity. Thank you.
Barry Hytinen: Okay. Hi, George, it’s Barry. Thanks for the questions. So we feel really good about the way the team is progressing with respect to Project Summit. The full program we anticipate generating $375 million of benefit. You’ll recall that last year, we generate about $165 million of benefit. And year-to-date, together with last year, so program to-date, we’re at about $257 million of benefit. We will end the year with all of the run rate savings in the numbers. So we expect to be exiting the year at the full program benefit that leaves about $50 million of year-on-year benefit next year. And so you should be penciling something about $70 million of incremental year-on-year benefit in the back half, probably split pretty equally this year with that $50 million remaining. So we feel great about the way the program is progressing. The team is executing well. You asked about investments. What you will see is we certainly did as part of Summit, invest in certain areas like our commercial organization, innovation, our global strategic accounts organization, and you would see that in our SG&A expenses this year, if you look at our SG&A year-on-year, it’s up excluding stock compensation expenses of about $16 million and actually more than all of that is in the commercial organization supporting growth. And so we – both in the form of increasing that organization, as well as some variable costs that go along with the great sales performance year-on-year, like, variable compensation expense. So you are seeing those expenses in the numbers already, and we expect that you will continue to see very good performance out of the team on Summit. Thanks.
Bill Meaney: Yes. And the other thing I would just add to it, Barry, I think, Barry’s last point as important as the $375 million is a net number. So obviously we’re making a lot of investments to transform the business, but the $375 million is net of all the investments we’re making.
Operator: The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, great. Thank you very much for taking my question. I just still focus a little more on the services business, obviously that seems to be doing a lot better you have new products and things coming to market. And I was just wondering, is there some impact on the margin from the mix of the newer products? It just seems like the gross margin was down sequentially, despite higher revenue, is they had kind of a ramp thing that’s going on. Maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on how that’s going through.
Barry Hytinen: Sure. Hey, Shlomo. It’s Barry. Thanks for the question. We feel really good about the way the team’s performing in our services organization, as you know the revenue is up considerable amount both year-on-year and sequentially. While the gross margin is a tick down, call it, 40 basis points, I’ll note that, that is driven by the fact that revenue in that line outstripped our projections. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks and if you look at versus our projections last quarter – for the quarter, we beat revenue by about $25 million round numbers, the vast majority of that was in services. So we certainly did to maintain customer service and we did have some level of, what I would consider like, surge expenses related to servicing that uptick in demand. And then I think you should expect that that will even out as we move forward. The decline in gross margin is about $1 million. So it’s not a tremendous amount. We feel good about the margins we’re generating off the new product offerings to Bill’s point on our Global Digital Solutions and our Secure IT Asset Disposition. Those are very nice margins. The other thing I’ll note is, our – if you work through the numbers in our services area on EBITDA, the EBITDA margin in that business was actually up 100 basis points sequentially, and that was up 640 basis point year-on-year. So we feel good about the way our services are performing. Thanks for the question.
Operator: The next question is from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please go ahead.
Nate Crossett: Hey, good morning. A couple of data center questions, if I may. There’s over $6 million of leasing per megawatt that you did in July. Was that single hyperscale lead, maybe give some detail on that? And then also, if you could talk about your outlook for pricing for the data center business, more specifically on renewals and mark-to-market over the next few years, because I think there’s been some crosscurrents in this space and your data center peers have said different things, when it comes to that. So I’m curious to hear, what you’re seeing in terms of the outlook for renewal pricing.
Bill Meaney: Good morning, Nate. I appreciate the question. So first on the 6 megawatts, yes, we really pleased to say, it’s a single customer for our Northern Virginia campus hyperscale and it’s a new logo to us. So on – just a number of fronts, it’s just a great – it’s a great customer win. And as you can see, our – we keep expanding capacity in our Northern Virginia campus based on the pipeline that we see even beyond that. So really congratulations to the team. I think in terms of the pricing, you’ve noticed this month, we were up slightly. So we thought that was actually a good trend. I think generally what we’re blessed being in that sense, relatively newcomer to the data center space that we don’t have as many historical customers that were originally sold in at higher than what today market prices are. So most of our customers, because we’ve been growing very quickly over the last few years are relatively new customers that are at, what I would call, new and – the new pricing level. So we don’t have as much pressure as some of our older peers that have had that. With the exception, we’ve called out in the last few quarters from time to time, when we did acquisitions, we knew we were acquiring some customers that had been with our acquired companies for a long time and that those were rolling off. So generally, we feel pretty good where we are on pricing. You notice that this quarter, we were on the 3.6 megawatts we were up quarter-on-quarter on pricing. And that was really more about mix that we were highly focused on collocation or retail and enterprise customers, which obviously come at higher pricing. So generally, we don’t see a big change in the pricing on customers that we’ve acquired or brought into facilities that we’ve acquired.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Funk from BoA. Please go ahead.
Michael Funk: Yes, thank you for the questions. Just one of the refocus on the RIM business for a moment, you made a comment saying as a backlog of incoming cubes. I’d love to get more thoughts there on, how that might impact volume moving forward. But then also took out the last quarter, would love any kind of commentary just on the volume trends you’re seeing, whether that’s the growth additions, the churn, and then how acquisitions also impacted the volume in the quarter.
Bill Meaney: Thanks. Thanks for the question. Good morning. I think that couple things, I would say. First of all, if we look at on the Records Management business, we see a very – if you look at quarter-on-quarter over the last, say four or five quarters, we see kind of pretty much the same kind of trends that bumps up and down. So we don’t see a big change in terms of the net volume trends in that part of the business. I do think that, because of the shutdowns that I referred to earlier in a number of our countries, we have seen a significant increase in backlog, waiting for people to be able to get back to office to allow us access to bring that in, so that’s positive. But if you just look overall in terms of our total physical storage business, we’re really pleased with how that’s coming out. Because if you look across the portfolio of our physical storage businesses, the first year – the first half of the year, where we’re up organically in terms of volume, we expect the second half of the year in terms of our physical storage business to continue that trend. So overall, the year we say flat to slightly up, but, as I say, we’re up slightly in the first half when we expect the second half to look the same. And then we add the normal price increase on top. So we feel really good in terms of where we’re sitting on the general trends and the trends within each of those segments of our physical storage business seem to be relatively consistent. I think, it will be a short-term uptick once we can access some of the boxes that were – that have been ordered for us to pick up. But I think that’s more to do with a one-off transition as we hopefully get out of COVID.
Operator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] Management. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. One of my questions you’ve already answered, but your company obviously has a larger workforce than a typical REIT. So I was wondering and you touched on some of the costs and how it’s expected to even out over the balance of the year. But I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the ease or the lack thereof that you guys were able to source new employees, retain employees. And also to what degree, wages are moving up. And do you expect that to accelerate in the back half?
Bill Meaney: I appreciate the question. So maybe what we’ll do is, I’ll answer the first bit, in terms of the acquisition of employees, because it’s a really good point. And then I’ll let Barry comment on the inflation that we see across our business, not just on labor. I will just say, inflation for us generally is our friend, because we have such high 75% – 70% to 75% gross margin business then, obviously, and we’re able to price pretty aggressively against that. So it generally creates a tailwind towards our margins. On accessing talent, look, it is luckily – we’re blessed with a very strong culture. So if you look at our employees and I’m referring mainly to our frontline employees, who really are the heart and soul of the company, these are the people that you see our trucks out on the road or people see our folks coming into the facilities or the people that keep the lights on in our data centers. They are very long-term employees. Culture is very strong and we have very low churn, for a service company, probably one of the lowest churns in the industry. So we’re blessed that we don’t have a lot of outflow of employees. That being said, the growth that we’re seeing in a number of our service areas, as well as our data center means that we are actively going out there and acquiring talent. And I’ll be honest with you, it’s tough at sometimes, but our biggest reference, our current core employee growth. So we haven’t seen a situation where we haven’t been able to grow with the demand except as a backlog I mentioned, because we just can’t access facilities. And there has been some short-term blips that Barry called out in terms of we had to use some expedited labor in a couple of cases, so that we could meet the demand. But generally, we feel that our culture has been our friend in terms of being able to acquire the necessary talent.
Barry Hytinen: Rob, it’s Barry. Thanks for the recent pickup of coverage. We appreciate that. On your question is related to inflation, I’ll say that, beginning of the year, I would say we were quite prudent with respect to our guidance on inflation, obviously, that’s a topic that’s very much in the popular culture right now. We – one of the reasons we can be confident in our guidance and increase the midpoint today is that, what we are seeing is not outside the realm of what we baked into our original guidance. And if you look at our cost of service label, for example, you actually see that we’re generating productivity, they’re both sequentially and year-on-year. And so we feel good about where we are and appreciate the interest. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Thanks for the question. Wondering on the capital recycling front, so you guided to $250 million this year, and it seems like cap rates continue to be pretty attractive kind of the low 4% range. So if I recall, I think you have just north of $2 billion of industrial real estate in your portfolio. How much that over time do you think you could potentially sell them, given the attractive valuation environment? I mean, do you think you could do even more in the near-term than you had previously guided? Thanks.
Barry Hytinen:
$125 million and I’m just increased it to $250 million: I think from a standpoint of going forward, you are thinking about it the right way. We’ve got a large portfolio and we see the opportunity – opportunistically continue to recycle a – relatively small amount. Without giving forward guidance, we’d historically said, you something on the order of a $100 million a year, maybe even $125 million a year as a planning posture. Obviously, our recycling efforts are back in circumstances we driven both based on what’s out there in terms of cap rates, as well as what we need from a development pipeline. I will say that one of the benefits of our businesses in light of the growth in EBITDA and the cash generation of our core business, which is just tremendous. We see the opportunity to continue to fund our development, both from internal growth of EBITDA and cash generation, as well as this sort of modest recycling. So that’s the way I would think about it. And I appreciate your interest.
Operator: Next, we have a follow-up question from Shlomo Rosenbaum. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much for letting me back in here. One of the – just a question on understanding the volume – physical volume trends in aggregate. There’s just over $5 million of volume from business acquisitions in the quarter and I was trying to – is that all in the wind business? And if I kind of assumed that, it looks like the room sequentially went down by $2.8 billion – $2.8 million. And I’m just trying to understand the last quarter, we kind of leveled out a little bit and it seemed to come down a little bit more this quarter. And I’m just trying to get a sense of, is there a stabilizing trend, a continued trend with a little bumps here and there. And just to basically try to understand that. And with the understanding that the other businesses seem to be outgrowing it in terms of the adjacent business and consumer other, but I’m just trying to get a sense of that RIM side.
Barry Hytinen: Hi, Shlomo, it’s Barry. Thanks for the question. Let me clarify that of the $5 million, about $4.5 million is in the core. That’s from the small deal we did in Asia, which is a $4.5 million acute. The rest is in the adjacent business category. And so when you work that through the model, you should find that the core was down just about 30 basis points, which to your point is – Bill’s earlier comments, very consistent with what we’ve been seeing even a little bit better than where we were, let’s say, a year, year and a half ago, in terms of sequential performance. We continue to feel good about our core business and expected as we guided earlier to be flat to slightly down on an organic basis for the full year. And in light of the dynamics that Bill mentioned in terms of the backlog for incoming cube and likely for the pandemic to continue to ease over time. We expect that that performance will continue to bump along and maybe even slightly improved. So we feel really good about where we are there.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain’s Second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect. Everyone else has left the call.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-06 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Iron Mountain Earnings Conference Call. [Operator instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, SVP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greer Aviv: Thank you, Irene. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On today's call, we will refer to materials available on our Investor Relations website. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including our strong start to 2021, despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic; the continued execution of our strategic plan; solid progress in our key growth areas; continued expansion of our global data center platform; and our strong commitment to corporate social responsibility, including diversity, equity and inclusion. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials will contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the safe harbor language on Slide 2, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliation to these measures in our supplemental financial information. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. I hope you and your families are safe and well. We are pleased to have delivered a strong start to the year with both revenue and profitability coming in ahead of our expectations for the first quarter, despite the ongoing challenges of the pandemic and continued lockdowns in many parts of the world. Some of the key accomplishments of the quarter include, we achieved a record level of quarterly revenue, pricing continues to yield strong results as highlighted by our organic storage rental revenue growth of 1.7% year-on-year. Total organic volume grew some 2 million cubic feet versus last quarter and we continue to forecast overall volume growth to be flat to slightly positive for the year. We saw strong performance from our growth areas. For example, digital solutions is showing year-over-year organic growth of 11%, while secure IT asset disposition or SITAD has shown 30% growth. We are in line with delivering over $50 million of revenue growth from these two dynamic areas this year. Our global data center team leased nine megawatts in Q1 versus our guidance of between 25 and 30 megawatts for the full year. We continue to grow our footprint acquiring a new land parcel adjacent to our campus in Northern Virginia, which will increase our total potential capacity in that key market to 145 megawatts bringing our total potential datacenter capacity globally to 445 megawatts. Finally, adjusted EBITDA grew 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and our margin expanded 100 basis points. It should be noted that Q1 this year is even more impressive given that we are comparing it to a year ago where COVID, for the most part, was affecting very few of our customers. Whilst the impact from COVID during this quarter continues with many of the 56 countries we operate in to be in various stages of lockdown, we are proud of the consistency and stability of our core business and we continue to deliver on our strategic plan. This reflects the diversity and scale of our portfolio, the depth and breadth of our service offerings and the efficiencies that have been created through project summit. To further underline the point, our sales productivity remains strong and our mountaineers persevered, resulting in Q1 overall revenue slightly ahead of last year, whilst our traditional service revenue, which is most closely tied with being in the office was off 7%. We continue to expect to see very modest improvements in core service revenue as we progress through the year and we are not factoring in a full COVID recovery for the traditional side of the business before Q4 and perhaps for some parts of the world, even Q1 next year. In the meantime, we can see in our results and our improved guidance, our growth from new product areas will continue to deliver overall growth in our business in spite of the COVID impacts elsewhere. We remain committed to taking purposeful and bold steps to transform our entire organization, both operationally and culturally. We remain true to our plans to accelerate growth and continue our digital transformation journey, which for us includes both an internal focus as well has expanded product offerings for our customers. We are confident that our continued delivery of overall revenue growth, together with the expansion of margins due to Project Summit will enable us to continue our acceleration and cash generation which will allow us to continue to invest in our future whilst returning more and more cash to our investors. Project Summit is well on track to deliver $375 million of annual run rate adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting this year, even after investing in new growth areas. In addition to adding $375 million to our EBITDA through margin improvement, Project Summit will continue to enable us to invest in the growth areas we identified and discussed last quarter, further accelerating our growth in revenue as well as profits. Some of these areas you will recall include digital solutions, consumer storage data center and SITAD. Examples to illustrate the impact of our focus on revenue growth can be seen from recent wins in digital services in SITAD. One recent win in digital services was with a global insurance company, which was managing its exposure from a large and complicated liability claim. This customer desired end state was to streamline underwriting and claims management processes by providing digital accessibility to records to quickly identify risk exposure, reduce processing times, improve SLAs, ensure chain of custody and gain scalability for large discovery audits. Our unique solution was to integrate 440,000 of their physical boxes with their digital information to provide a single view to search across and identify relevant and required information on demand. By leveraging our insight platform, we were able to immediately improve their legal discovery efforts and automate their claims processes. Another recent win was with the Government of Canada to leverage our Image on Demand or IOD solution to process applications for immigration, refugee or citizenship status. The government experienced a backlog during COVID, as staff could not access offices and applications kept piling up. This digital solution enabled the government staff to work through the backlog. We are currently imaging more than 4000 applications on a weekly basis, which are then digitally delivered for processing by the Government of Canada's employees. Switching to SITAD, this quarter, we have secured contracts with for large global clients to provide services across the globe. These engagements cover everything from enterprise infrastructure, such as servers, routers, switches, printers, copiers, to small personal devices and specialized equipment such as card readers. Our solutions in SITAD are the only ones on the market built around a secure chain of custody where assets attract at every stage of their journey, and our customers' data is kept secure. Also, our disposition process is built with sustainability in mind. We are a leader in thinking and acting for the environment. Demand for these services is particularly strong as companies look to consolidate and transform their physical footprint to move to new hybrid collaboration models post COVID and we expect to partner with many more of our enterprise and global clients throughout 2021 and beyond. Now, let me switch gears and spend some time discussing our ESG commitments including the sustainability of our products, services and operations, as well as our efforts focused on diversity, equity and inclusion. Our Eighth Annual Corporate Social Responsibility report will be published later today. In that report, we share sustainability goals as part of our ESG commitments to reduce our environmental impact. Whilst we have been extremely successful in achieving targets that were previously said, including exceeding our science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions six years ahead of schedule, we are introducing even stronger commitments to our planet, our customers, our employees and our communities. Some highlights include we are committed to achieving carbon net zero by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Climate Accord. We are proud to be ranked number 81 on Newsweek's list of America's Most Responsible Companies in 2021. By 2025, we are committed to building all of our newly constructed multi-tenant data centers to be certified to the BREEAM green building standard. In addition to contracting for renewable energy equivalent to 100% of our data center electricity load worldwide and passing through the carbon reduction benefits to our customers who avail themselves of our green power pass, we have announced our first electricity supply contract that matches our load 24/7 with local renewable generation for our facilities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Additionally, we shared with you our recommitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, not just because it is just but also because it is key to our strategic success and being a more creative and dynamic organization, which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs. For example, by 2025, we have committed to increasing representation of women in our global leadership team to 40% from 31% today, and people who identify as BIPOC in our US leadership team to 30% from 19%. Thanks to the true commitment of my fellow mountaineers across the globe, and with the guidance and engagement of our employee resource groups, we have made significant progress on our journey, but have a lot more to do. To further us on our journey, I'm pleased to announce that we have recently recruited Charlene Jackson as our Global Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer. Charlene brings a strong set of experience and skills as we continue building our global enterprise into an organization which is both diverse and inclusive. Finally, before handing the call over to Barry, I would like to provide a bit more information on the data center performance. As I mentioned earlier, our global data center team is off to a strong start leasing more than nine megawatts in the first quarter. As you likely saw, this included six megawatts with an existing US-based Fortune 100 technology company. We also signed a one-megawatt lease in Singapore with a leading e commerce end gaming company. The remainder of the leasing for the quarter was co-location and we continue to build our pipeline for both hyperscale and retail deployments. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we closed on our joint venture with Web Werks, and have already seen great growth prospects from that partnership. Web Werks recently announced that they have acquired a land parcel to build a standalone purpose-built Greenfield data center in Mumbai. This new data center will be designed to support 12.5 megawatts of IT capacity with a rich, interconnected ecosystem consisting of major telcos, over 150 internet service providers, and three major internet exchanges. The new facility expected to be operational by mid-2022 abuts Web Werks existing data center in Mumbai, which would result in a campus with 15 megawatts of total capacity. We also continue to grow our platform organically with the recent purchase of a land parcel adjacent to our existing Northern Virginia campus. This parcel is expected to support 32 megawatts of IT capacity at full build out. In addition, we redesigned our Manassas Campus master plan and can now support 30 megawatts of IT load at VA-2 compared to 24 megawatts previously, as well as an additional 35 megawatts of capacity at the campus. With these designs and scope changes, our NOVA campus capacity has increased more than 90% to 145 megawatts with 16 megawatts built in 72% of that leased. Our total data center potential capacity globally now is 445 megawatts and/or an increase of more than 18%, giving us a long runway for future development and growth. In closing, let me say thank you to our mountaineers and their families for their continued support and dedication in what has been a difficult and heart wrenching year for many. We and our customers count on our essential workers every day. And I personally always come back inspired after meeting with many of our teams around the globe. Our results demonstrate accelerating earnings growth, the resiliency of our business, revenue growth in new areas and the benefits of our culture. Our culture supports customer first with an innovative mindset. With that inner DNA, we will continue to climb higher together with our customers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, our team delivered solid performance that exceeded expectations across each of our key financial metrics. Building on the improved performance we delivered in the second half of 2020, revenue trends continue to strengthen in the first quarter. Our core physical storage business is demonstrating its resilience and momentum is building in our growth areas. We are confident in our projections and are pleased to raise our full year financial guidance. Turning to our results for the quarter. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion grew 1.2%. Total organic revenue declined 60 basis points. Organic service revenue declined 4.8%, a marked improvement from prior quarters representing our best performance since the first quarter of 2020. While our service activity is still experiencing an impact from COVID, March was the first month since February 2020 with positive organic service revenue growth. Our team continues to drive improving trends with growth in our global digital solutions business and revenue management notable call outs. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7% with continued benefits from pricing, combined with a slight increase in volume. Adjusted EBITDA was $381 million. We exceeded the projections we shared on our last call, as the team delivered stronger margin flow through together with the revenue beat. First quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation and revenue management, offset by COVID driven impacts to the business. AFFO was $235 million or $0.81 on a per share basis. As we mentioned on our prior earnings call, AFFO reflects an increase in recurring CapEx as we catch up on some projects that were deferred during the pandemic. Our full year recurring CapEx guidance is unchanged. Turning to segment performance. In the first quarter, our global RIM business delivered revenue of $967 million, an increase of $11 million from last year. On an organic basis, revenue declined 80 basis points. The team performed well with constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 1.7% or 1.6% on an organic basis. Growth was driven by pricing and volume. While our traditional services have been impacted by the pandemic, trends continue to improve during the first quarter. We are focused on expanding our global digital solutions business and in the first quarter, we experienced strong growth building on the commercial successes we delivered in 2020. We are pleased with the continued performance in our consumer storage business. Even with normal seasonality, the business contributed nicely to our overall physical volume. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA was $409 million, an increase of $17 million year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 120 basis points driven by pricing and Project Summit. Taking a look at headline numbers for our global data center business, we had another strong quarter of bookings with 9 megawatts. We are well on track to deliver our full year target of 25 to 30 megawatts. Total revenue grew 6% year-over-year, in line with our projections. As I mentioned on our prior call, we expect revenue growth in the data center business will be more back half weighted as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commence in the second quarter and beyond. We continue to project all year revenue growth in the range of low-double-digits to approaching mid-teens. With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility. In the second quarter, we anticipate an increase in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA compared to the first quarter. In terms of margin, we expect the second quarter to be down two to three points sequentially as a result of COVID driven construction delays and one-time build out services for a specific customer. We expect margins to remain at that level in the third quarter before recovering in the fourth quarter. In late April, we formed a joint venture with Web Werks, a leading co-location data center provider in India. We made an initial investment of approximately $50 million in exchange for a non-controlling interest. As we have previously disclosed, we expect to invest an additional $100 million over the next two years, which we expect will result in a majority ownership position. Turning to Project Summit, this quarter, the team delivered $50 million of incremental year-on-year adjusted EBITDA benefit. As a reminder, we expect Summit to contribute $150 million a year-on-your benefit in 2021, with another $60 million of year-on-year benefit in 2022. Total capital expenditures were $113 million, with an investment of 85 million of growth CapEx along with 29 million of recurring CapEx. Turning to capital recycling, in the first quarter, our program generated approximately $12 million of proceeds. With the highly favorable market backdrop and our strong data center development pipeline, we remain committed to recycling approximately $125 million of industrial assets for the full year. Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of just under 5.5 times, slightly better than our projection and down from last year. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. For 2021, we continue to expect to end the year within our target range near the high end, which will be modestly down from year end 2020 on a pro forma basis. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early July. As we have said before, we are fully committed to our dividend at this sustainable level. Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid 60s as a percentage of AFFO. Turning to our outlook. Today, we are pleased to increase our 2021 financial guidance. There are two factors driving the improved projections. Our outlook for the business continues to improve with first quarter performance better than expected and increased confidence in our key growth drivers and the underlying business trends. Second, we've also factored in the benefit from two small recently closed acquisitions as well as the Web Werks investment. And I would note that we have been able to increase our guidance despite the ongoing impact of COVID on our traditional services business and construction delays in Frankfort. For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue of $4.365 billion to $4.515 billion. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.585 billion to $1.635 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents growth - of revenue growth of 7% and EBITDA growth of 9%. We now expect AFFO to be in the range of $955 million to $1,005 million and AFFO per share of $3.28 to $3.45. At the midpoint, this represents 10% growth for both metrics. Our guidance assumes global organic physical volume will be flat to slightly positive versus last year, our revenue management program will provide a significant benefit in 2021 and I will note that nearly all of the actions driving that benefit were in place by the end of the first quarter. For services, we are prudently assuming some measure of continued COVID impact, albeit the first quarter was another good proof point for the momentum building in our digital solutions business. While we do not typically guide quarterly, with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the second quarter. We expect revenue to approach $1.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA to approach $400 million. We are confident in our outlook and the strength of our pipeline. We expect to grow revenue sequentially throughout the year. In summary, the year is off to a good start. I am confident in the team's ability to continue to build on our momentum. We feel well positioned. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Last quarter, you made a push into various growth markets. At this point, can you summarize how big your growth portfolio is? And how your growth expectations for this growth portfolio have evolved over the past quarter since doubling down into these areas of growth verticals and perhaps how much funding you would need to put into your initiatives in order to accelerate the growth in these in these growth markets? Thank you.
Bill Meaney: Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. So taking back, as you referred to, the last meeting, so over the last five years, we've been developing a number of new products and market approaches that really have taken us from a total addressable market where our products and services range from 10 billion to over 80 billion. So the things that we've been doubling down are consistent with that roadmap and picture that we highlighted last year, and that 80 billion, I should highlight, is also growing kind of low teens in terms of organic growth rate. So if you think about highlighted SITAD, for instance, in digital services today, I mean, I wouldn't say that we've just been doubling down on them in the last quarter, this has been a continuous build with I would say acceleration is part of Project Summit. And part of Project Summit, you're seeing the 375 million net EBITDA improvement that we are delivering and committing to. This is net of the investments that take us - that's required to actually invest in our digital services SITAD, our continued investment in data center, further acceleration in consumer, for instance. So the investment is already in there. The 375 million is a net number that's coming out. And I think you can expect, as we said today, if we just looked at SITAD in digital services this year alone that will add roughly $50 million of revenue on a year-over-year basis. So, we feel pretty good. Obviously, we just highlighted those two today, but across the board, and you can see it also in data center with nine megawatts leased in this quarter. So we feel pretty good about now aiming towards an $80 billion market in terms of revenue growth and that was part of Barry upsizing the revenue guidance for the full year.
Operator: Our next question is from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo.
Eric Luebchow: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on the guidance, I'm just wondering if you can parse out the guidance increase what's coming from really operational outperformance versus perhaps some slightly more favorable foreign exchange rates that you experienced in the quarter versus last year? And then, another question on the data center side, just wondering, if you look at future growth areas, are there potentially any new markets either domestically or internationally that can make sense for Iron Mountain to enter either via M&A or through new Greenfield development or do you think you're just going to continue to develop in the markets that you have today? Thank you.
Barry Hytinen: Hey, Eric. Good morning. It's Barry. Maybe I'll take the first one and I'll let Bill take the second one. I appreciate the question. As compared to our prior guidance, the increase of $40 million of revenue and 10 million of EBITDA is really driven by two factors as I mentioned on the call. First, it's our outlook on the business which just continues and improve, the first quarter performance I think is a testament of that. The team did very well - executed very well in the first quarter. And we're continuing to increase our confidence in our growth drivers and the underlying business trends. That's about $20 million of revenue in the guide up and probably seven - round numbers 7 million of the EBITDA. The second point is we factored in the benefit from two recently closed acquisitions, as well as the Web Werks investment. That's about combined $20 million of revenue in the year. Note that we acquired those in the second quarter, and then about call it 3 million of EBITDA. I'll remind people that the Web Werks acquisition is not consolidated, so there's no revenue that comes along with that in our financials. I would also just note that there's no change in our assumption as it relates to foreign exchange rates. So the rates that we're using and the impact of that on our growth that we had in our prior guidance is unchanged in the current guidance. So it's the underlying business performance together with the couple of small deals. Thanks for the question, Eric.
Bill Meaney: Yeah, the only thing I would add, Eric, in terms of other areas of growth for datasets - so I appreciate the question is, let me kind of parse it out into theaters or parts of the world. So if we look at domestic, as you know that we have a land bank in Chicago, we continue to like the Chicago market. So it's just a matter of where our priorities are in capital allocation. So I think you can expect at some point Chicago will be on the map. Also we continue to like the potential opportunities to repurpose some of our electricity meters, if you will, in California, where we can actually buy wholesale power, which gives us an advantage in terms of power costs, by taking a records management facility and repurposing that into a data center. So, California continues to be an area that we remained focused on as potential market for further development. On Europe, as we highlighted a few calls ago that we started building Frankfurt and then sold the thing out 100% of the 27 megawatts, so Frankfurt is a market that we continue to look at further expansion to it, because it's a key market serving continental Europe. London too, as we noted, is in full development but that's also looking to be pretty buoyant. So we'll continue to look at if we need more capacity in London. And then the last aspect I would say in London is we have had a few of our customers approach us on looking at edge deployments, and where we were considering actually repurposing some of our industrial real estate footprint into data center. So if you think about, we have a land bank for our data center business, which takes us up to 445 megawatts but that's not including the 80 million square feet of industrial warehouses that we have around the world, a number of those are suitable to be repurposed into data centers. So we continue to look at that mainly for as an edge kind of deployment, which can be anywhere from, let's say, from two to six megawatts. On the Asia front, as Barry highlighted and I mentioned in my remarks, we're super excited about the joint venture that we have with Web Werks. India, we think has a lot of potential and we're already seeing pent up demand, partly it's regulatory driven and partly, it's just the growth of the economy. So I think there's a lot more for us to do in India. As you would have noted that we're now 100% sold out in Singapore. So we're working through the permitting process on finding additional capacity in that market. And there were other areas in Southeast Asia, which I think are early days that we're looking at countries that would be interesting to expansion. And I would put Latin America in the same category is that there are a number of areas in Latin America that we're starting to look at, but we're at earlier stages for those areas.
Operator: Our next question is from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI.
Sheila McGrath: Yes, good morning. Bill, the short interest in the stock is down but it still looks elevated to reap. Certainly not something you can control but I was just - the concern has always been storage volume, given paper trends. Can you just give us your updated insights on how Iron Mountain is still growing storage volume, total revenue and effectively shifting to adapt your business to these changing trends?
Bill Meaney: Good morning, Sheila and thanks for the question. Yeah, I think also it is people really start understanding the durability of our business and also the ability for us to continue to grow organically, cash generation through top line growth. I think people are starting to realize that they probably overplaying the paper storage aspect of the story. So I mean to your point is that, you saw the records volume was slightly improved from Q4 into Q1. Overall, we reiterate our commitment that we expect physical storage in the business to be flat to up for the full year again on an organic basis, and then you add three points of price to it. So - and given the relatively slow growth of that business, there is not a lot of CapEx is going into it. So we feel really good because this is just effectively generating tons of cash, that we're able to plow over to invest behind some of those growth initiatives that are targeted at the $80 billion total addressable market that I mentioned before, as well as datacenter, which we've been increasing our capital allocation to over the last few years. So, I think over time, I mean, people are going to really understand that the physical volume - physical storage business is alive and well, and we're getting good price increase on top of that. And of course, as you alluded to some of the other new physical storage areas like consumer continue to deliver dividends, and then on the other aspect is the revenue growth is starting to pick up from the investments we've made over the last five years into new business areas, I think is starting to come through.
Operator: Next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. I kind of want to piggyback on the last one, just in terms of the organic storage rental, on the one hand, the guidance is going up, you guys did better. The organic storage rental growth range embedded in the guidance, though, didn't change and I'm not sure if it was just kind of it's a rounding item or the growth is really coming outside of that. And I guess related to that is the sequential change in the physical records volume was the slowest decline I've seen over a while and I was wondering, if you could point to what's going on over there? Is there more of an influx of boxes, less of an issue with destructions, just you used to give more detail on a slide that's not in there anymore, maybe you can talk to these items.
Bill Meaney: Thanks, Shlomo. I'll talk about the physical volume side and then Barry can give you our thinking around the guidance around storage. So I think on the physical volume, if you've been watching this story for a very long time, I mean first of all, that the record storage is just one aspect of our physical storage business, right. And at the end of the day, it comes down to occupancy and our ability to drive cash returns for that business. So we feel that, I wouldn't say a large diversification, but a purposeful diversification of our physical storage business, I think you can even see that our data is showing the robustness and continuity of that business, which we feel really good about. Specifically to your question on the sequential Q4 to Q1 improvement in the records management side of the business, we're really pleased with it and that's why it continues to give our confidence that overall physical storage will be flat to slightly up for the year. And part of that improvement, which you can say during a COVID timeframe is kind of interesting, is really I give a lot of credit to our global strategic accounts organization, which we set up I guess, about 12 to 18 months ago, is their degree of mining and broadening the conversation with our customers is showing real results, not just in the new areas that I highlighted in my opening remarks around digital services in SITAD, which we've had, obviously, really nice growth in that area, but they actually is part of a broader conversation they're having with our customers, which quite frankly has delivered more box to our facilities as well. So, we feel pretty good across the board. We feel good about the different conversation we're having with our customers due to some of the investments we've made in our commercial operations. And Barry, you might want to talk about that.
Barry Hytinen: Hi, Shlomo, it's Barry. Thanks for the question. And I will say that there's an element of rounding and candidly, an element of conservatism certainly the year has started off well and is trending a little bit better than our expectations that I mentioned in the setup. I will note that that those percentages are organic. So while we have a couple of small deals that is a purely organic number. The growth is coming in quite balanced. So we're seeing improving trends on storage and service. So thank you for the question.
Operator: Our next question is from Nate Crossett of Berenberg.
Nate Crossett: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones, if I may. First inflation, how should we think about expense growth for the year? What are you guys seeing in terms of labor costs, input costs? And then two, just your current view on funding the growth areas of the business right now, in the past you've used TV [indiscernible] is equity/using ATM [ph] lever that you would consider using?
Barry Hytinen: Hi, Nate. It's Barry. Thanks for the question. So, we certainly did, as I mentioned in last call, include some level of what I would say is kind of normal inflation, the levels that were being talked about at the time. We don't see anything that is outside of our expectations that were embedded in the original guidance and that's part of the reason why we were able to continue to raise the guidance for the beat that we saw in the first quarter. I'll note that with our structure in our relatively high margins on both storage and service, it does result in with inflation, the opportunity to price that much more incremental profitability for us. And as you know we kind of price comparing to other logistics companies. So in some respects, it helps a little bit with our revenue management program. In terms of funding growth, a couple of thoughts. One, obviously, we're continuing to expand EBITDA, thanks to Summit and the team's underlying performance, we will be doing a level of capital recycling this year, call it $125 million is what's embedded in the guidance. I'll note that the market there is very favorable and we continue to like cap rates. And so those would be the principal things I'd mentioned in terms of where the yield is and where the stock is. We feel very good about our ability to fund our operations within our framework and so we'll be funding from things like recycling and the growth in EBITDA.
Operator: Our next question is from Jon Atkin of RBC.
Jon Atkin: Thanks. So, I guess a commercial question, and then more of an M&A question. I was wondering, as you think about your leasing objectives, where you see the greatest potential in your supplemental, there's obviously a very good layout of your pre-stabilized portfolio, the expansion pool, and new development. I can imagine any one of those three would be potential sources of new pre-leasing or leasing. But within those three categories, is there one or two that kind of standout as - of those categories that stand out as to where you see the most potential for these through the balance of the year?
Bill Meaney: Thanks, John. Good morning. Thanks for the question. We think about it kind of two different ways. So, if you look at say, in the US, some of our two really large campuses, which would be obviously Northern Virginia and Phoenix is a lot of our expansion and development in those sites is driven by line of sight to customer conversations that we're having, which you can imagine, because those are large campuses that attract a lot of attention from customers, both on the co-location as well as the hyper-scale side. If we look at some of our European markets, it's more just based on the dynamics and the absorption versus the level of capacity in those markets, like places like Frankfurt, London, etc. So I think it's kind of two different worlds. And then the same thing in New Jersey, it's a high reasonable levels of absorption with the right balance of supply. So I think it's a mix, there are some cases where it's purely on market dynamics. And there are other areas where we really liked the conversations we're having with a number of customers, especially around some of our large campuses.
Jon Atkin: Okay. And then if you could maybe just refresh us on going forward interest level in inorganic expansion, and so whether that's sale leaseback private read portfolios, shells that are occupied by cloud players, and so forth. I think there's been a little bit of cap rate compression recently, for instance, in the US, but just interested in any updates or thoughts on types of M&A that you would continue to entertain?
Bill Meaney: Okay. Yeah, there's kind of - I think I understand two parts of your question. So first of all, on the M&A, we feel really good about the platform that we have, as it is today, so we don't anticipate any large M&A. I mean, they're obviously - the Web Werks in India is what I would call a more of a brownfield situation where it's a smaller M&A deal that gives us a platform for further Greenfield build out in what we think is a really interesting and high growth market, just like we did EvoSwitch a few years ago in the Amsterdam market, right, which again was kind of a brownfield. So, if we're talking about those kinds of things where we do a make versus buy situation for entering into a market or expanding in a market, we will continue to look at those kinds of what I would call small M&A deals. But, large platform M&A deal, we don't see we really have the need. I think partly, we are already in 56 countries for many decades as an operator, so we feel we have good cultural fit in the countries that we operate in. And we already have a pretty good international spread across our data center business, so we feel really good. On the capital allocation question I would just reiterate with what Barry said before is, we feel that between EBITDA growth and opportunities to recycle capital, like what we're doing in our industrial portfolio where the cap rates are, we think, really low. We like that trade of trading in exposure on industrial right now and putting more capital at work in data center.
Operator: Last question is a follow up from Sheila McGrath of Evercore.
Sheila McGrath: Yes, two quick questions. Margin improvement of 100 basis points was a positive, how should we think about that, as the year progresses? And is more of the improvement on cost of sales or SGA? And my second question is Bill, you mentioned existing own sites could potentially be repositioned as for data center. Just wondering, have you done that already or is anything underway?
Bill Meaney: No, thanks. So, Sheila, I'll answer your question on the edge data center deployments using our existing footprint. At this point, it's only a conversation. So there are a couple specific sites that we're looking at in Europe at the moment with customers but it's still early days, I would say. But I'm encouraged by the conversations we're having there and the flexibility that our industrial real estate footprint potentially gives us down the road.
Barry Hytinen: Sheila, thanks for the question. It's Barry. Couple of things. Certainly, as we move into the second quarter, we're looking for EBITDA to be approaching 400 million, which is very nice growth rate and reflects, to some extent, of course, last year's COVID impact. And as you work through the model, you'll find another continued nice growth in EBITDA going forward. I will say, I think a notable call out, frankly, in the first quarter, is the fact that our cost of sales are actually down about $15 million, despite sales being up. And that is a testament to the team's strong progress on Project Summit. As we talked about before, Project Summit in 2021 is vastly going to be benefiting cost of sales as opposed to SG&A, just in light of the sorts of operational improvements that we talked about and highlighted, such as service delivery, changes, etc. And so you really saw that starting to come to fruition in the first quarter with the vast majority of that Summit benefit year-on-year that I called out being in cost of sales. And that's a trend that we expect to continue for the remainder of the year. Appreciate the questions, Sheila.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-24 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Iron Mountain Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greer Aviv: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We have provided the user-controlled slides on our Investor Relations website. We will also be providing the link to today's webcast and earnings materials. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO, and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. Today we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance including how we had successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, how we continue to execute on Project Summit and the resulting transformation across the organization, how we have accelerated momentum in our data center business, and how we are increasing our commitment to diversity and inclusion and other sustainability initiatives. After our prepared remarks will open up the lines for Q&A. Today's earnings materials will contain forward-looking statements, including statements about our 2021 and longer-term expectations. As you know, all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2 and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G in our supplemental financial information. With that Bill, would you please, begin?
Bill Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well. As we close out a year, which has been marked by first quarter delivering near record growth to our remaining year where we had to manage headwinds from COVID, I want to take a few minutes to reflect on where we've been and where we're going. First, I want to pause and acknowledge that we continue to fight COVID-19 and we maintain making the safety of our employees, their families and our customers our first priority. Whilst we are optimistic of the positive impact the roll out of vaccines will have, we continue to believe that 2021 will look similar to 2020, albeit in reverse in terms of the macro economic landscape. However, 2020 was also a year where there was much to celebrate, which came out of the creativity and resiliency demonstrated by our teams. I couldn't be more proud of my fellow mountaineers around the world in terms of the way we responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a phrase, we managed the crisis, the crisis didn't manage us. We continue to serve our customers where throughout the depths of the crisis, more than 96% of our facilities remained open. We maintained our focus on Project Summit, where we increased our targeted sustained annual cost savings from $200 million to $375 million and have already achieved over $200 million on an annual run rate by the end of 2020. We accelerated our growth in data center, with 58.5 megawatts of new leases announced in 2020 versus 16.9 megawatts in 2019. We continued our investment in new products and innovation with a focus on supporting our customers' remote workforces. These services led to growth in our digital solutions year-on-year of 8%, excluding FX. And we continue to see good returns from our global strategic accounts organization and maintained our focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit to be one more in tune with accelerating our revenue growth through new services and solutions. This continued focus on expanding our service offerings to our customer base of 225,000 customers in organizations, in spite of COVID has allowed us to guide to organic revenue growth of 2% to 6% in 2021, the highest level of growth in the past decade. This significant investment in innovation, in new product development is supported by our purpose to be our customers most trusted partner for protecting and unlocking the value of what matters most to them in innovative and socially responsible ways. Our strategy is highlighted by an important balance between accelerating growth, driven by developing end-to-end solutions to help our customers unlock value from their content as well as sustaining growth in physical storage and data center. In other words, being both the lock and the key to many of our customers' physical and digital data assets. The strategy is underpinned by our high performance, customer obsessed culture and our strong customer connection with not only 225,000 customers, but over 950 of the world's largest 1000 companies. It is not simply investment in products that has given us accelerated revenue growth, but a deliberate focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit. This shift in culture is marked by a singular focus on our customers as our North Star and acceleration in our commitments around diversity and inclusion, not just because it is just, but also because it is a key to our strategic success in being a more creative and dynamic organization which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs. And an increase in our commitment to carbon neutrality. 2020 saw us continue to secure renewable energy to meet the power needs of a 100% of our data centers, even with the rapid increase in bookings and new facilities operating. Some examples of our laser focus on how we have responded to our customer's needs in more creative ways included processing unemployment benefits to get them into the hands of people in need during the crisis and setting up 12 digital mailrooms around the globe for customers who didn't know how they were going to stay connected with their remote workforce. In a phrase, we helped our customers when they needed it most. What that all means to me, is that we came out of 2020 stronger than ever. A company with a new sense of momentum that will fuel both our top and bottom-line growth. In the next few minutes, allow me to illustrate for you what I mean by momentum. If resilience was the word for 2020, growth is the word for 2021. We're already seeing evidence of this growth in data centers, for example, and expect this to continue. As we have discussed before, we are also seeing good growth in digital solutions as well as physical storage, both from the continued durability of our records management business, together with an expanding consumer business, and believe this growth should continue. This change in revenue growth trajectory is a direct result of the investments we have made in new product areas, coupled with changes we have made in our commercial engine. One of the fundamental changes we have made in our commercial approach is that we have invested in creating more time for our salespeople to engage differently with our strategic customers. This extra time with customers has allowed us to uncover new revenue opportunities, not just for additional physical storage and new datacenter customers, but for digital services, which provides both greater visibility for doc data as well as deriving much more value from data born both physically and digitally. As a result, you can see both from our performance last year as well as the guidance we have provided today for 2021, our company is more and more seen by our customers as a partner who, yes, protects and manages all their physical and digital assets, but also gives our customers the key to integrating their information, unlocking its value, as well as accelerating their own digital transformation journey. For 70 years, we've offered protection for the assets our customers' value most. We now more and more catalog, index, govern and manage complete information across physical and digital domains, securely storing what customers need, disposing of what they don't, and helping them unearth the insights that drive business transformation. Let's now explore some exciting growth opportunities ahead of us. These are areas where we see great opportunities for growth as we position ourselves to unlock greater value for our customers and include data centers, fine arts and entertainment services, consumer storage, secure IT asset disposition or SITAD, small and medium business, content service platform or CSP. Think of this as electronic content management or ECM on steroids and secure offline storage or a highly secure air gapped data storage for cost effective protection against ransom attacks. Let's go into a little bit more detail about a couple of these areas. In data center, we have built a strong global platform with 15 operating facilities across three continents since 2017. And we just announced an agreement which once closed, will mark our entry into the very fast-growing Indian market through our investment in Web works. The total addressable market for our data centers globally is $20 billion and is growing at over 10% per colocation or retail customers and over 40% for the hyperscale segment. If you look at fine art stories and entertainment services, it's roughly a $2 billion market for both together. Just two months ago, the L.A. Times wrote an article about our entertainment services business. They called us the Fort Knox of Hollywood. The article highlighted how we are driving a different level of growth in that business through not just storage, but how we facilitate more opportunities for the studios and artists in distributing their assets to viewers and listeners. In consumer, we've grown the business in one year from about 2 million cubic feet of storage to more than 7 million cubic feet of storage, so three times as big in just 12 months. The total addressable market for consumer storage is more than 35 billion, and it is growing at about 5% to 6% per year. I note that our segment focus is on Valet storage, where our logistics expertise gives us a strong competitive advantage, as well as being a nice submarket which represents a significant opportunity for future growth. Our SITAD business has an addressable market of $10 billion, and we have seen strong growth in this business over the course of 2020. More importantly, we have found that our strong heritage around data security and chain of custody is proving a differentiator, as we recently took on the global responsibility for SITAD on behalf of two large financial institutions. So hopefully this helps you appreciate why we are so excited about the growth opportunities as we look to 2021 and beyond. Taking together, the seven areas I highlighted earlier, represent a significant market opportunity for us. Let me put some context around that. If you look back to 2015, the total addressable market we competed in was $10 billion and on average those markets had low growth rates. Over the last five years, as we've listened to customers, built expertise and developed new products and solutions, the addressable market we now compete in is over $80 billion, yes $80 billion. Additionally, those products and services that we've developed expertise in are growing at a 13% organic growth rate. So not only has the addressable market for expanded services grown by over eight times, but these new areas have double-digit industry growth rates, which helps facilitate our entry. Let me now shift gears and briefly review our performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2020. At a high level, we couldn't have been more pleased with the way our mountaineers navigated the challenging environment in 2020 brought on by COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic, we were laser focused on execution and controlling those factors that we could, leading to outperformance against our own internal expectations through the last three quarters of 2020. This resulted in continued strength and total storage rental revenue, which grew nearly 4% on a constant currency basis in 2.4% organically. While service revenue declines continue to offset the solid storage growth, we grew adjusted EBITDA 1.3% when adjusting for currency. And our margin expanded a 110 basis points in 2020. This all in-spite of total revenue being down $115 million due to service activity declines. I want to thank our teams across the globe who stayed focused in the phase of so many obvious distractions. Our success is a reflection of our mountaineer's dedication and most importantly, I have been inspired by the way our teams looked after both the physical and the mental health of each other as they navigated the threats from COVID, both at work and at home. Turning now to our physical storage business. Total global organic volume was essentially flat compared to the third quarter. Contributing to this was a 1.9 million cubic foot increase in consumer and adjacent businesses, offset by a similar decrease in records and information management volume. For the full year, total global organic volume was flat, which is a good outcome considering the environment in which we were operating. This year, we expect total global organic volume to be flat to slightly up. Looking more specifically at RIM organic volume, this was down 1.9 million cubic feet sequentially. For the full year, organic volume declined 1.1%. In our Global Digital Solutions business in 2020, we were actually able to grow service revenue 8% year-over-year, excluding FX. Despite the pandemic, our team grew revenue. This goes back to the different mindset I mentioned earlier. We see a further acceleration in our digital solutions business going into 2021 and expect to exceed $300 million in revenue for the year. Turning now to our Global Data Center segment, the team had a phenomenal year. Blowing its leasing targets out of the water, quarter after quarter. For the full year, we leased more than 58 megawatts. Remember, our target coming into 2020 was 15 to 20 megawatts. I want to underscore that that success was not just the result of leasing to hyperscalers. We had a very good commercial momentum in our core enterprise retail colocation business, which represented 12 megawatts of the 58 megawatts or close to 40% of our bookings, excluding Frankfurt. We attracted 73 new logos to our platform during 2020, adding to our broad and diverse base of more than 1300 data center customers. This should enable us to strengthen our network ecosystem and increase the stickiness of our deployments. We also had a busy year in terms of development, with more than 10 megawatts commissioned across multiple data centers and geographies, increasing our leasable megawatts to a 130. Our team is actively adding to our development pipeline to ensure we have the right capacity in the right markets to meet robust customer demand and we are excited for the opportunities we see ahead of us in 2021, where we expect to end the year with over 170 leasable megawatts. One of those opportunities is further expanding our data center footprint into new fast-growing markets. As I mentioned earlier this morning, we announced entering into an agreement for a strategic JV with Web Werks, which once closed would expand our reach to India including Mumbai, Pune and Delhi. The data center market in India is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years and India is the second largest telecommunications market in the world. We are excited to be an early mover into an emerging market where the demand is high and the supply is low. Turning to Project Summit. We generated adjusted EBITDA benefits of a $165 million in 2020, consistent with our most recent expectations and significantly ahead of our initial estimates of $80 million reflecting strong execution in swift and decisive actions - activity actions on early initiatives. This gives us an exit rate of annual savings of over $200 million heading into 2021. As you will hear from Barry in more detail, we are fully on track to recognize the estimated $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefiting this year and we are excited for the tangible benefits we will experience this year as we continue to enhance our technology and processes. Before I wrap up, I'd like to provide a little more detail about our continued commitment to cut our carbon emissions I referenced earlier. We were one of the first 100 or so corporations worldwide to have an ambitious carbon reduction goal approved by the science-based targets initiatives as being aligned with the Paris Climate Accord. Already in 2019, we reported that our goal to cut 25% was more than doubled by delivering a 52% reduction six years sooner than our 2025 commitment. As we did this, whilst growing our global data center business, one of the most energy intensive industries in the world. We continue to flex our innovation muscle around energy consumption as well as having introduced the green power pass to our customers. This is the first solution of its kind and allows us to pass the benefits of a 100% renewable energy data center platform to our customers for them to use to meet their sustainability targets. We're confident based upon the momentum we are building in this area that we can achieve a 100% carbon neutrality well before 2050, in spite of our rapidly growing data center business. To summarize, I've never been more optimistic about our opportunities for growth at any other time in our history even with the anticipated continued headwinds due to COVID impacting our traditional service areas. And I'd never been more proud of how we behaved as an organization over the course of 2020 and through the pandemic. We went above and beyond for our customers and our teams and embraced new collaboration tools in change how we work. Our mountaineers truly lived our values day-in and day-out. I'm excited to be on this journey with you all and I can't wait to see the future together. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks Bill. And thank you for joining us to discuss our full year and fourth quarter results. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics. For the full year, revenue of $4.1 billion declined 2.7% on a reported basis, which includes a 100 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.3%. Organic service revenue declined 12.8% reflecting the continued COVID impact on our activity levels. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.4% driven by more than 2 points of revenue management. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.3% year-on-year to $1.48 billion. Reflecting the team's strong progress with Project Summit and revenue management, EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points or 35.6% representing the best margin performance in the company's history. Importantly, we see opportunity for profitability to continue to expand overtime. AFFO increased 2.4% to $888 million or $3.07 on a per share basis. Before I go into more detail, let me draw your attention to Slide 13 of our earnings presentation. We have made some refinements to our non-GAAP measures spurred by feedback from the investment community that some of our non-GAAP measures are difficult to compare appears. This includes changes to how we account for unconsolidated ventures, stock-based compensation and a portion of growth capital. To ensure comparability and transparency, we have provided our results on both the former and new methodology of course, the prior method will be comparable to current consensus estimates. For example, under our former methodology, full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $1.45 billion which compares to the current consensus of $1.446 billion. More detail is available in our earnings slides and on our Investor Relations website. Now, turning to our results for the quarter which are based on our updated non-GAAP definitions. On reported basis, revenue of $1.1 billion declined 1.8% which includes a 40 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined to 3.4%. Organic service revenue declined 12.1%. Overall, we continue to see service declines moderate with the fourth quarter reflecting a modest improvement in service trends. Total organic storage rental revenue grew 1.7% driven by revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA was $374 million under both our new and former definition, we exceeded the projections we shared on our last call as revenue trends both in storage and service were better than planned. Fourth quarter EBITDA reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix offset by COVID driven impacts to the business. AFFO was $191 million or $0.66 on a per share basis in line with our prior projections. AFFO reflects an increase in recurring CapEx that had been deferred earlier in the year and higher cash taxes. Turning to segment performance, in the fourth quarter, our global RIM business had strong storage revenue growth driven by volume growth in our fastest growing markets and revenue management. This was offset by declines in service revenue albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year leading to total organic revenue decline of 3.6%. In our shred business, the combination of lower tonnage and an 8% decline in paper price versus last year resulted in a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. While there's been a slight step up in the index prices in January, recycled paper prices have remained low. At recent levels, we anticipate paper prices will result in EBITDA headwind of slightly over $10 million in 2021. We are pleased with the continued momentum in our consumer storage business as it becomes a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth. Global RIM adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points driven by revenue management and Project Summit. In the fourth quarter, we continue to see fixed cost deleverage as we ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level to fully support our customers. We also had a step up in facility expense as we invested in maintenance that we had delayed over the prior two quarters. Taking a look at headline numbers for our global data center business, full year bookings came in at 58.5 megawatts. Excluding the full building lease in Frankfurt, we leased 31.5 megawatts representing bookings growth of 26%. Total revenue grew 9% year-over-year. We are pleased with our data center performance for the year and expect to continue to see and improving trajectory, thanks to the strong commercial success. In 2021, we expect at least 25 to 30 megawatts, which at the midpoint would result in more than 20% annual bookings growth. We feel good about the state of our pipeline, both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail colocation. We project full year revenue growth in the range of low double-digits to approaching mid-teens. With our strong prior year bookings, we have good visibility to revenue. For the first quarter, we expect growth rates similar to the fourth quarter as the bulk of our 2020 bookings commence in the second quarter and beyond. Turning to Project Summit. As a reminder, we expect total program benefits of $375 million, of which we delivered $165 million in 2020. We expect an additional $150 million benefit in 2021 with the balance in 2022. This quarter, the team delivered $52 million of adjusted EBITDA benefit. As to capital expenditures, in the fourth quarter we invested $163 million, bringing the full year to $446 million in line with our prior expectations. In 2021, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million, consisting of approximately $410 million of growth CapEx, of which we plan to allocate approximately $300 million to data center development. We expect $140 million of recurring CapEx. Turning to capital recycling. In the fourth quarter our program generated approximately $451 million of proceeds, which includes the Frankfurt data center joint venture we mentioned last quarter. For the full year, our capital recycling program generated approximately $475 million. I would like to call out the sale leaseback transaction we announced in December, which we sold a portfolio of 13 industrial facilities generating gross proceeds of $358 million. This portfolio was sold at a cap rate slightly below 4.5%. This was a compelling opportunity for us to monetize a small portion of our owned industrial assets, while effectively maintaining the long-term control of the facilities through an initial 10-year lease with multiple renewal options, among other favorable terms. On a leverage neutral basis, this transaction freed up approximately $260 million of investable capital that we intend to redeploy into faster growing areas, including our data center business. We plan to make these investments in 2021 so our year end net debt balance reflects these proceeds. With the highly favorable market backdrop and our strong data center development pipeline we are planning to continue to recycle industrial assets. In 2021, we are planning for $125 million of recycling. Turning to the balance sheet, at year end, we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity. We ended the year with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times down from 5.7 times at year end 2019. Pro forma excluding the investible proceeds from our leaseback, leverage would have been slightly under 5.5 times. As we have said before, we are committed to our long-term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times. For 2021, we expect to end the year within our target range near the high end. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early April. As we have said before, we are fully committed to our dividend at the sustainable level. Our long-term target for payout ratio is low to mid 60s as a percentage of AFFO. Now, to give you more details as to our outlook for 2021, we are pleased to reinstitute financial guidance reflecting the strength of our business, our team's strong execution and improved visibility. For the full year 2021, we currently expect revenue of $4.325 billion to $4.475 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.575 billion to $1.625 billion. At the midpoint, this guidance represents revenue growth of 6% and EBITDA growth of 8%. At the midpoint, our guidance implies about 75 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement year-on-year. We expect AFFO to be in the range of $945 million to $995 million or $3.25 to $3.42 per share. At the midpoint, this represents 9% growth for both metrics. Our guidance assumes global physical volume will be flat to slightly positive. Revenue management will be a significant benefit in 2021. And I will note the majority of those actions have already been taken as we speak to you today, and nearly all of them will be in place by the end of the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we are planning for a continuation in the strong trends we are seeing in digital solutions, combined with a slight recovery in our service activity across the year. In terms of EBITDA, our expectations include the benefit from revenue management and top line growth, as well as Project Summit savings. Partially offsetting those benefits is a prudent outlook for inflation, a step up in cost from prior COVID driven discretion, rent from our sale leaseback transactions and innovation spend. While we do not typically guide quarterly with the pandemic, we felt it would be helpful to share our expectations for the first quarter. On a dollar basis, we expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be consistent to slightly up from the fourth quarter results. In summary, our team is executing well. Visibility is improving and our pipeline across the business has been strengthening over the last several months. We feel well positioned as we move into 2021. I am confident in the team's ability to continue to build on our momentum. And with that operator, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You highlighted growth opportunities from data centers, fine art, consumer storage, secure IT asset disposition and other services. Can you describe your go-to market strategy to penetrate these growth markets and what proportion of revenue you expect this growth portfolio to evolve to over the next three to five years?
Bill Meaney: Hi, George. No, thanks for the question. I think this year most of the growth will be around the digital services, which I highlighted. So, I said last year we did 8%, then we see a further acceleration in that growth rate going into this year. And on SITAD, you'll continue to see its relatively small portion of the business. But as I said, to give you some idea of the scale, those two global contracts that we've signed early in this year to serve financial service institutions, those two combined are probably in the order of about 15% year-on-year growth. So, it's pretty high levels of growth on what it traditionally was smaller parts of our business. But over time, over the next year, what you can expect is over the next year or two, we'll start guiding more and more to those individual pieces of business. But if you think about it, what this all means is more on a consolidated basis. It gives us the confidence on guiding say that, we said that 2% to 6% growth in terms of top line range. And if you take the midpoint that's 4%. It just gives us much more confidence as we go forward that we can really start driving bottom line growth, not just through margin expansion, but through top line growth, because of the resiliency and the attractiveness of these new segments.
George Tong: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you. Hey, Barry, maybe you could help me parse just the 2% to 6% organic revenue growth? When I look at it, the adjacent businesses versus the core business if they're growing roughly 13% in line with the end markets, that seems to be would be a little bit above 3% growth. What is the embedded assumption for the balance, in other words, the core business in the storage? Is that assuming you're going to get consistent 2% to 3% pricing, and is there any FX that's involved in that as well?
Barry Hytinen: Sure, Shlomo, thanks for the question. If I take the total revenue guide, which is 4% to 8%, that's a little over $250 million at the midpoint or slightly over 6%. We're expecting data center, as I mentioned, in the prepared remarks to be up, kind of double-digits so we're approaching mid-teens. So, let's call it $40 million of pure revenue growth be a small amount of FX on that number, since you asked about that. And then turning to the global RIM business, we're projecting in a 200 plus million of total growth. Now, that's assuming revenue management of the normal levels that we've been experiencing 2% to 3%, maybe even a little bit closer to the high end as we continue to roll that out. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, certainly the vast majority of those actions will be in place by the end of the quarter. We're certainly expecting with COVID for planning to flat to slightly up volume. And Bill mentioned the digital solutions, which would be probably in the vicinity as much as $50 million of year-over-year benefit. And that results in a very slight service activity recovery for the balance of our services. On adjacent businesses, we're continuing to see the business improve. But I'd say we're being a little bit conservative and prudent with respect to the COVID impact as we continue to see those underlying markets recover. I will note that, we did see for the second quarter in a row, very nice volume out of our adjacent businesses. And that's the entertainment services business continuing to see improving trends. Bill, anything you'd like to add there?
Bill Meaney: I think, that covered it well.
Barry Hytinen: The only other element Shlomo, I would add is from an FX perspective, it'll be about call it 1.5 in total of the 4 to 8, something of that order in light of where FX rates are in terms of forward projection on banks - bank views, so thanks for the question.
Operator: The next question comes from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please go ahead.
Nate Crossett: Hey, good morning. Two quick questions, if I could. I was curious on the specs of the new JV, how much will you guys own? How did it come about and is this the kind of platform where there'll be opportunities over time? And then also just a question on capital recycling? I think you mentioned $125 million. I'm just curious, how much of your industrial portfolio would you be willing to recycle long-term?
Bill Meaney: So, thanks for the questions Nate. So, coming on the Web Werks JV that we announced this morning. Great question. So, we're super excited about India. I mean, personally, I've been to India, I don't know how many times over the last three years specifically looking for a data center, the right data center entry, because it's been on our radar screen for quite some time. And with Web Werks, we found a very good partner that already has presence in Mumbai, Pune, and Delhi, which three of the key regions, and they have a roadmap to expand that to Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai. So, which we really think gives us a very good platform, because Delhi is not a single location. In terms of the way, why we chose Web Werks is that, first of all the team, its entrepreneurial brothers that actually built the company, and they have always had a very strong focus on telecommunications interconnects. In fact, that's how they started their business. So, we think that actually they built a good ecosystem around the locations that they already have. They understand the market and the business extremely well. So, we're also buying into effectively a management team. And as we alluded to, in our press release is that the way the JV is structured is we start in a minority and they have about 4 megawatts that are actually running as we sit here today in those three locations, but they have both Brownfield expansion capacity as well as land for further greenfield expansion. And $150 million that we announced will be put in overtime on a cost basis as we build out that expansion. So, you can think of it as a way that we paid slight premium for our entry, to get the additional 4 megawatts and the management team. And then that $150 million that goes in over the next two or three years will lead to us to have a majority ownership. And that will be on a cost basis, that money put in. So, we'll effectively slide down towards a cost that is approaching, the actual cost to build the facility. So, we're really excited about the market. It is the second largest telecommunications market in the world, it has probably about 10% of the data center running in India and Northern Virginia. So and it's just a very fast-growing market. We've got a great management team that comes along as part of the deal. And we have a clear roadmap to expand and build a truly Indian footprint.
Barry Hytinen: And Nate, thanks for the question. This is Barry. On the recycling point, we as you know, see recycling of industrial assets is highly attractive as we see the valuations as really good at these levels. And together with our development pipeline and data center, among others, it's a really good move for us to invest in faster growing opportunities. The way I think about it is industrial assets continue to increase in terms of valuation. So the level of recycling that we've assumed in the plan this year would kind of be a mid-single digit percent of purely the industrial asset base. So, we've got a - and that is obviously a base that continues to expand in terms of value in light of what's going on in asset prices out there. So over time, I think planning for something in this level, annually, is not a bad place to plan if I were you. And I would also note that, if we continue to see opportunities on both sides on the industrial side, as well as incremental opportunities in the development pipeline, we would not be afraid to continue to recycle even at a little bit higher level, but for the year, we're planning 125. Thanks for the question.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Funk: Yeah. Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question. A couple if I could. So, first thinking about the potential impact of wage inflation on the business with the $15 minimum wage, being pushed through. Wondering how that might impact your proposed cost savings?
Bill Meaney: Thanks for the question, Michael. I think it's an important topic and wage inflation just across even absent of the $15 minimum wage, in terms of our frontline staff, especially our carriers, right, we've been in that, I would say a highly competitive environment, for the last four or five years at least with a boom of e-commerce. So, for us, the $15 minimum wage is less than an issue. Most if not all of our workers are kind of north of that. The bigger issue for us is, quite frankly, the pressure on e-commerce for similar types of jobs. That being said, we've been able to manage our churn pretty well. And the one thing I've spent personally a fair amount of time traveling around the country as well as in Europe and in Mexico, speaking to our frontline staff, many of whom we had to furlough during the depths of the crisis, just to take the temperature and their connection to the company, their loyalty, the gratitude in terms of the way our leadership teams have managed the crisis and also tried to support them and their families both mentally, health wise and monetarily has been highly appreciated. So, I think, I still remain very confident that mountaineers are really mountaineers, we look after each other. But the inflation that you're referring to is less for us driven by the minimum wage and it's more driven by just the boom in e-commerce, but it's a good point.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. Good morning. We do sometimes get questions how Iron Mountain competes in the data center business versus pure play players. I was wondering if you can provide more insights on how you answer that question. Any details behind the benefits of Iron Mountain and cross-selling? And just what makes you more competitive? And was there much competition on that India joint venture?
Bill Meaney: Okay, thanks Sheila for both questions. So first, I guess my flippant answer to your first question is, I think 58.5 megawatts this year says that we're pretty competitive. So, I tell my congrats to our team who have really dug in. I think the other thing what I would say is just another proof point. Then I'll say how we're compete, is that if you look at our, especially on the sales side, but also in the operation side of our data centers, most if not all of these folks come from leading what I would call pure play data center companies. And so, you can almost say and to me it's not - you measure the success of your offering in two dimensions. One is, do customers buy it, right, which is the 58.5 megawatts this year of leasing activity our new leases signed, I think is a pretty good proof point. On the other side is, are people willing to bet their career and their livelihood by coming to join you who are specialists in the field and I have to say that market who leads that business has done a remarkable job in terms of attracting really, I would say, top tier focused data center talent. Now, in terms of the synergies between the business, which goes into the secret sauce, which you alluded to, is still about 40% of our whole own leads come from our traditional records management sales force. And that's you're seeing that even more and more now that we set up strategic accounts. So, I don't go to a strategic account meeting where they pulled out a strategic account executive for me along where we're not speaking about data center opportunities. I mean, just last week, Barry and I were with the number two executive of a global bank and he brought up data center even before we could, Barry and I with one of our strategic account executives. So it's a - people definitely see the connection, the decades, this is our 70th year, the decades of trust that we've had with financial service institutions. And it's the reason why the likes of Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have trusted us with their colocation installs. So, definitely the trust is a big factor. And the team seems to be really getting great traction in the market.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thanks so much. Barry, can you help us just understand how much the EBITDA methodology changes in fact the 2021 EBITDA if at all, just based on the recapture the air back at stock-based comp and growth capital and then the JVs?
Barry Hytinen: Sure, thanks, Kevin. There's a lot of material in our slide deck, but let me go through a couple of things. From an EBITDA standpoint, the stock comp, year-to-year is very similar. I will note, like most companies, we have a performance element in our grant. So, it's conceivable that depending upon where performance is those grants could go higher or lower. So, I would be planning for that to be very modestly up year-on-year. On the [Indiscernible] ventures, as it relates to how that impacts EBITDA, there's two things there as you know, our consumer joint venture where we have a higher ownership, but while the business is performing better year-on-year as our plan, it still is in a loss position. So that'll be a little bit more of a headwind. And then we'll add on the Frankfurt joint venture where we own 20%, as you know. And that starts up as we mentioned before, the lease commences at about midyear and ramps over time as the client gets into the lease. So that, I would say the unconsolidated ventures portion is fairly similar year-on-year, slight improvement. So, net-to-EBITDA, very similar to the 2020 level of the add back that you see in the documents. EPS and FFO would flow similarly to EBITDA. And then from an AFFO standpoint, you'll note that there's less impact there than EBITDA since we were already adding back stock comp. So that has no change to AFFO. And the portion of growth capital is essentially at the same level. And I already mentioned the unconsolidated joint venture. So, an add back of kind of a high single digit million-dollar benefit to AFFO year-on-year, not unlike what we had again in 2022. Good question. Thanks for the question.
Operator: The next question, comes from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Bill, I think said that, post COVID you expected organic physical volume storage volume growth would be about 50 basis points or so and seems like you'll be pretty close to that range this year. So, is that still the right way to think about the business once we get beyond COVID? And then related to that, have you seen any impact this year from the decline in incoming boxes that you talked about last year as a result of the pandemic and have those declines kind of more or less normalized to this point? Or is there still some impact to the business? Thanks.
Bill Meaney: Yeah, I think to your first question I would say, yes. And in part of that, that recovery is based on the success that we've had in consumer is I mentioned in my remarks is that, we went from 2 million cubic feet to 7 million cubic feet last year, I'd say in 2020. In terms of the incoming volume, we still see the similar trends as we saw pre-COVID. At this point, we haven't seen a - we have and you can almost you can see that no supplemental, we haven't seen an acceleration in that headwind that we're getting. But we're still for sure going through what I think I described on a few calls previously, maybe was a year ago, what I call the second derivative action. In other words, virtually all our customers are continuing to send us new boxes. But some of our historically, fastest growing and largest verticals are sending them in at slower rates. So, we continue to see that what I call the second derivative drag on volume coming in slower than boxes aging out at their normal kind of 15-year lifespan. So, we expect to continue to have what I would call the same pre-COVID headwinds on the traditional document side of the business more than offset by the growth in consumer.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephanie Yee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Stephanie Yee: Hi, thank you. I also had a question about incoming boxes, just as people returned to work maybe later in the year, would you expect the incoming boxes to kind of pick up to pre-COVID levels? And kind of along with that, as incoming boxes pick up would constructions also pick up when people are back in the office more?
Bill Meaney: Hi, Stephanie, and thanks for the question. That would be our expectation, right. But I think it's - I don't think it's going to be a sharp change, because I think the people's transition back into the office will be more gradual than that. But I would expect that, but again, when you net those two things out, we don't expect a marked change in the trend. I mean, if you think about it, during the course of last year, is I think that our - it is basically a flat storage story. And then you add pricing on top of that is actually not a bad story at all. So, we don't see either an acceleration in either direction of that trend. But I think, what you described is would be, I think, a reasonable expectation, but I think they probably will, fairly closely net each other out.
Operator: The next question comes from John Atkins of RBC. Please go ahead.
John Atkins: Thanks very much. On the data center side, I guess I just wanted to get a sense on what competition you're seeing when entering new markets versus data center peers, financial sponsors, thoughts on just - a few thoughts on preferred path for joint ventures versus outright acquisitions? And then when it comes to, I guess on a related question, do you have any kind of general thoughts on build to suit versus sale leasebacks?
Bill Meaney: Okay, thanks, John, for the question is quite a bit in there. So, let me kind of start about how we think about the JVs or we use India as an example. So, India is a country that we're pretty comfortable in. That's why, specifically, it's actually been more than three years, actually I think, five years. I go to India, at least a couple times a year. But I would say five years ago, I started going there with a focus on finding the right data center entry. Even though we have a little less than 2,000 people working on the records management side in India. So, it's a market we know is for us, it was important to find the right not just physical opportunity for entry, the right footprint, but also the right team that we could build on. And with Web Werks, we found that I think from a Web Werks standpoint, they also appreciate it is that we are not a financial sponsor, or we're not a newbie in the Indian market. So, that they see how we operate in India already today. Culturally, we're tuned to the challenges that they have in a very supportive of their journey. And so that, in this case, Deutsche Bank ran the process. But I think one of the reasons why we won was the relationship we were able to build with the entrepreneurs and the way we the way we operate. So that to me is part of our secret sauce is that, we are a company that is in 56 countries around the world, over 20,000 mountaineers around the world so that we can make those connections. And then also it's not lost on these entrepreneurs in this particular case, that we were actually refusing data center demand. We had a number of customers, they were asking for capacity in India, and quite frankly, we just couldn't deliver for them so that we can bring that network to bear. I think if you kind of think more broadly on build to suit, as we build out our reputation with some of the large hyperscale players, so as we announced the Frankfurt started off, not as a build to suit but ended up being a build to suit effectively, because we had that interesting data center asset, and it was hyperscaler that needed the whole 27 megawatts. So, the design and engineering got modified to satisfy them. And that was one reason why we put it into the type of joint venture structure that we did, because it turned out to be a completely stabilized asset from day one, if you will. That has also led us to have, we haven't done any at this point but there's more and more that are approaching us to look at build to suit opportunities. And quite frankly, we just look at the returns. If the campus supports that, and it allows us to actually further expand or even upgrade the capacity of a campus by bringing in more power on the back of a build to suit opportunity, then we absolutely entertain it. The last thing I would say is that we are starting to see more pipeline. Now, whether or not we execute on that is interesting is that, when I was talking about the Frankfurt situation is that, what the customer there admitted to me that he really does see us as one of those handful of suppliers that he looks to when he's needing third party capacity. So, just naturally we are starting to see those kinds of opportunities, whether or not we actually execute on them really is going to depend on the types of returns in this specific campus opportunity.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Iron Mountain fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Iron Mountain third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greer Aviv: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We have provided the user-controlled slides on our Investor Relations website. We will also be providing the links to today’s webcast and our materials. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO, and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO.  Today we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including how we are continuing to respond and adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, continuing to demonstrate top line resilience in our physical storage business, continuing to see strength in our data center business, progressing on our transformation program with Project Summit, and how we are remaining committed to funding innovation and new product development. After our prepared remarks, we’ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today’s earnings materials will contain forward-looking statements. We have noted the impacts from COVID-19 and our expectations of how that may impact our operations and financial performance in 2020. We have also noted our expectations for Project Summit as well as certain other comments on our expectations for the remainder of the year. As you all know, forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today’s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on Slide 2, and our annual report on Form 10-K and other periodic SEC filings for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included a reconciliation to these measures as required by Reg G in our supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Meaney: Thank you Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well. The third quarter provided us with a great opportunity to demonstrate the significance of the measures we have taken over the last few months in response to the pandemic and set a marker for outperformance through top line resilience in our physical storage and growing data center businesses, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and by maintaining our strong cash generation track record all while continuing our investment in innovation and new product development. I would like to thank all of our Mountaineers for this remarkable performance and for their steadfast focus on safety and execution.  Despite lingering uncertainty related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen improvements, albeit gradual, in key U.S. and international markets as it relates to our service activity levels while showing continued strong performance in both our physical storage business and our global data center business. I continue to be inspired by the tireless efforts of our teams as they support and care for our customers, each other, and our communities whilst accelerating progress on our strategic priorities. From the start, we set our priorities to deal with the situation clearly and take care of the health and safety of our people and work hard to honor the commitments we have made to our customers. In April, we had up to one-third of our workforce out on furlough or other temporary leave. I’m happy to report that we have brought a significant number of these Mountaineers back to work to serve our customers and we now have over 90% of our employees working regularly. Whilst this has been a very difficult time, we have proven to be very resilient. We are financially healthy with strong and reliable cash flow driven in part by our brand and customer loyalty. This was evident in how we’ve managed the heightened uncertainty of the past eight months.  We quickly aligned on the right mix of priorities to maintain strong near term momentum whilst continuing our investments in innovation and new products as we execute our plan for long term value creation. This combined with the benefits from Project Summit has allowed us to continue to invest in transforming and modernizing our company. As demonstrated by our year-on-year constant currency year-to-date adjusted EBITDA in storage revenue growth, we can already see the evidence supporting our belief that we will emerge from this pandemic as a stronger company on all dimensions.  Clearly, there are still many uncertainties around COVID in terms of the development of the pandemic and how the governments worldwide will continue to respond with varying degrees of restrictions as infections rise. However, in the third quarter we saw signs of improvement in customer trends and as a result, the decline of our service revenue moderated.  In addition, there is clear evidence that as and when the restrictions lift, customers do come back to us with needs from both a physical and digital document storage perspective, and while some elements of our business may have changed forever, our positioning with the communities we serve remains strong. Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to adapt and transform our business model and solutions to changing customer needs due to challenges created by COVID-19. Our customers are evaluating their real estate needs, business processes, and ways to increase digitization in a remote workplace setting. We have been focused on helping them navigate these challenges and have tasked ourselves with accelerating our response to our customers’ needs. One thing is certain - the pandemic has created opportunities for us to help our customers in new and innovative ways.  The fact is we’re a different company than the one most people know. The strategic journey we have been on has driven this change, and to remind folks, our focus remains on three pillars: first, continue growing physical storage revenue through pricing as well as new volume growth achieved from records growth in emerging markets and art and consumer storage in developed markets; second, utilizing our global scale as well as 70 years of customer trust to deliver a differentiated data center offering; and third, new products and services that allow our customers to achieve reliable and secure information management in a more complex regulatory environment and one in which hybrid, physical and digital solutions are the norm. Further expanding on the product and services pillar, most know us for protecting highly regulated records, but over the years our relationships have evolved to help customers manage a broader set of assets and to help them solve a broader range of problems. As customers’ needs evolve, their expectations with us evolve. For this reason, it is important we continue to invest in creating solutions that unlock value for our customers. A great example of this is a solution we just provided for a U.S. credit union who needed a faster, more efficient method for processing their members’ mortgage loans after closing. Their old process was too manual and it could no longer support the volume of work, much less scale to meet the credit union’s 30% year-over-year growth projection, and it didn’t satisfy increased regulations the organization must now meet when selling their loans. We rebuilt the customer’s workflow to better integrate their mix of paper and digital loan materials. This included mailroom services, document scanning, and private vault with fire resistant safeguards in defensible, secure disposition. We also applied machine learning to automate how the credit union accessed data, verified its accuracy, and resolved missing or incorrect items.  With these changes, the credit union can now process post-close mortgage loans much faster, more than doubling their capacity whilst reducing their costs by 25%. This example speaks to what we see as our differentiation and why customers ultimately call us when they need help. For some time, we have talked about our opportunity to enable our customers’ digital transformation journeys. Initially, much of this work was going on behind the scenes, especially as Project Summit got underway, putting in place the systems and structures to support this transformation. The benefits of this work are now becoming more evident with notable improvements to our customer experience at a time when demand for our solution has never been greater. This materialized in the third quarter and high single growth in our digital solutions business.  If you look at our physical storage business, this remains a key foundation for Iron Mountain. Customers have long trusted us to secure their information and their assets that matter most to them. They needed us to serve as their lock, if you will. But over time whilst their needs expanded beyond security and compliance, their jobs grew more complex as they now had to store, use and extract value from growing amounts of information that was in both physical and digital form. They hybrid nature of their data was preventing them from achieving speed, compliance, efficiency, and ultimately growth.  A lock was no longer enough. They now needed a key to solve for this hybrid environment. Uniquely, Iron Mountain offers both the lock and the key that organizations need in order to realize competitive advantage from their paper and digital information.  Plenty of companies offer a secure home for valued assets; plenty offer technology services so customers can better use those assets. But this over-specialization falls short of the needs of most customers. We hear from our customers that they want partners who can help them build singular solutions capable of solving for multiple demands of speed, cost savings, revenue opportunities, and security. This is Iron Mountain’s distinctive position. We serve as the lock and the key.  Now let’s take a closer look at business trends during the third quarter. At a high level, we are pleased with the stabilization and early recovery we’re beginning to see across our service business. Service activity levels have shown a gradual improvement from the second quarter; however, similar to what we discussed last quarter, the shape of the recovery will be dependent on macro factors. The recent increases in COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world has focused states and countries to implement new restrictions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Whilst these factors will make the recovery uneven, our experienced management team is prepared to competently manage the volatility. Turning now to our physical storage business, total organic storage rental revenue growth accelerated modestly from last quarter, up 2.5%. This once again was driven by strong revenue management results as well as growth in our emerging markets and consumer. We continue to be very encouraged with the levels of organic storage revenue growth underscoring the durability of the physical storage business in supporting strong cash generation. Total global organic volume increased 2 million cubic feet sequentially. Contributing to this was a 3 million cubic foot increase in consumer and other and fine art storage, partly offset by a decrease in records management volume.  Looking more specifically at records management organic volume, this was down 1.1 million cubic feet compared to the second quarter. Whilst still in decline, this is a significant improvement from the 3.9 million cubic foot decline last quarter, again reflecting the early signs of recovery. We continue to expect the full year organic volume to be down 1% to 1.5% and up 2.5% in terms of organic revenue based on current visibility. Turning now to our global data center segment, we are very encouraged by another strong quarter of bookings. In Q3, we leased 12.3 megawatts, bringing the year-to-date total to just over 51 megawatts. The strong leasing this year, particularly among smaller deployments, has resulted in an increase in our utilization by more than seven points to nearly 92%. Given the need for additional capacity, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately 50 megawatts, consisting of both greenfield development and further build-out of existing facilities. Moreover, in excess of 50% of our development is preleased, resulting in a strong backlog. Let me now provide a brief update on Project Summit. Our transformation program is progressing well and we are on track to realize our permanent structural cost savings of $375 million per year exiting next year. As you saw in our press release this morning, we now expect to be able to generate greater adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 as we have accelerated some initiatives. Most notably, these ongoing initiatives should not only significantly reduce our cost base but also make it easier for our Mountaineers to get work done, enabling them to focus on a more customer-centric approach. Some examples include driving global standardization in IT, replacing cumbersome manual processes with reliable automation, and improving the user experience whilst reducing process cycle time. We are as excited about the systems and process improvements that are Project Summit as we are about the bottom line improvement and believe the end result will be an enhanced value proposition for our customers and communities.  As we shared with you last quarter, we are strongly committed to all of our stakeholders. We are focused on our culture, especially our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. I would also point out that we are committed at the executive level to continue on our path and accelerate improving our diversity and inclusion. In order to be a sustainable and successful company, we need to attract the best talent to drive maximum creativity through diverse and innovative thinking. I am proud to say we achieved a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2020 Corporate Equality Index. This recognition reinforces the important work we are doing and supports our goal of building and promoting an inclusive culture that encourages our employees to bring their whole authentic selves into the workplace. As we look at our business going forward, we see opportunities as well as risks, and we are making every effort to ensure we are well placed to maximize the opportunities. We are cautious about our expectation of the pace of market recovery as we progress through 2021. In our own business, as we have shared with you on previous calls, we expect the gradual recovery in our service business to continue as economic activity recovers, leading 2021 to look similar to 2020, just in reverse in terms of quarterly progression. The work we are doing and have done to address the challenges posed by COVID-19 gives us confidence that we will come out of this positioned to consistently deliver long term, sustainable growth. In summary, we are leveraging the opportunity in this rapidly changing environment to reaffirm our commitment tour strategy of growth through increased product offerings in the physical storage area as well as continued rapid growth in our data center and digitization areas. At the same time, we continue to exercise prudent cost control and drive further efficiency across the organizations through our transformation activities. We are proud of the progress we have made towards our transformative shift during this crisis. We are now even more enthusiastic about the speed of our future transformation given the lessons we have learned during the pandemic. I hope you all remain well, and with that I’ll turn the call over to Barry. 
Barry Hytinen: Thanks Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics. Revenue of $1.04 billion declined 2.4% on a reported basis year-on-year, which includes a 30 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Total organic revenue declined 3.4%. Organic service revenue declined 13.5%, reflecting the continued COVID impact on our activity levels. While the pace of recovery continues to be dependent on many factors, overall we continue to see service declines moderate, reflecting an improving trajectory since the April-May time frame. For the full quarter, service trends were generally consistent with the July levels we discussed on our last call. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.5% driven by three points of revenue management and data center growth, partially offset by a 30 basis point decline in global organic volume on a trailing 12-month basis. This is a 30 basis point improvement as compared to the second quarter on a trailing 12-month basis.  Adjusted EBITDA was $370 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points year-on-year to 35.7%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management, and favorable mix while partially offset by fixed cost deleverage on lower service revenue and higher bonus compensation accrual.  In addition, in the third quarter we incurred incremental cost to keep our team safe, for example specialized cleaning of our facilities as well as purchases of personal protective equipment. We included these expenses in our adjusted EBITDA.  Adjusted EPS was $0.31, down a penny from last year. AFFO declined 5.4% to $213 million. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the decline in AFFO was primarily driven by timing of cash taxes consistent with our outlook. Turning to segment performance and starting with the global RIM organization, in the third quarter our global RIM business experienced declines in service revenue, albeit at moderating levels compared to earlier in the year. This was partially offset by storage volume growth in our faster growing markets and revenue management, which led to a total organic revenue decline of 3.9%. That together with better than planned Project Summit benefits resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 110 basis points. In the service business, we experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 31% for new boxes inbounded and 39% for retrievals and re-files. We also continued to see a slowdown on the outgoing side as permanent withdrawals declined 28% and destructions were down 22%. In our shred business, activity declined approximately 17%.  For the third quarter, our average realized paper price was 20% higher than the prior year, which was more than offset by a decline in paper tonnage, leading to a net $3 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. As we projected on our last call, after the temporary spike in recycled paper prices in April and May, prices have taken a step down and by October, paper prices have now returned to the low levels experienced at the end of 2019. Our consumer storage business has maintained momentum and continues to be a more meaningful contributor to our overall physical storage volume growth. In the third quarter, we continued cost reduction actions, including furloughs and reduced work hours, albeit at much lower levels than earlier in the year. As service revenue expectations improve, we want to ensure we are staffed to the appropriate level so we can always support our customers. As we have discussed before, this does tend to cause incremental cost de-leverage as we bring back employees ahead of demand. We think this is the right investment to service our customers. Turning to global data center, the business delivered organic revenue growth of 12.1% driven by prior period leasing and strong service revenue growth. This was partially offset by moderate churn of 160 basis points, in line with our target of 1% to 2% per quarter. In the fourth quarter, we are expecting slightly elevated levels of churn compared to our normal target range. In the quarter, we booked a non-recurring revenue adjustment of $1.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% was consistent with our first half trend. As Bill noted, our data center team continued to deliver strong bookings momentum, signing over 12 megawatts of new and expansion leases, bringing year-to-date bookings of 51 megawatts. This commercial success resulted in us exceeding our previous full year target through the first nine months. For the full year, we expect to deliver more than 55 megawatts of new and expansion leasing, representing bookings growth of 45%. Of course, that includes the significant hyperscale lease in Frankfurt, and excluding that we would expect bookings growth of about 23%. This compares to our original guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts, or mid-teens booking growth. We believe we are growing considerably faster than the broader market. Going into next year, we feel good about the state of our pipeline both from a hyperscale perspective as well as our core retail co-location business supporting rich ecosystems across our platform. We believe we can lease in excess of 20 megawatts next year, which would result in mid-teens annual bookings growth. In October, we announced the formation of our joint venture with AGC Equity Partners, a great than €300 million partnership for our fully preleased data center in Frankfurt. This venture represents an important strategic step towards our goal of identifying alternative sources of capital to fund accelerating growth as we expect proceeds will be redeployed into higher return development opportunities. As we have previously disclosed, the venture will be reflected as an unconsolidated joint venture and therefore will not flow through to revenue and EBITDA.  Turning to Project Summit, in the third quarter we recognized $48 million of restructuring charges as well as an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $48 million. Through the first nine months, we have delivered $113 million of benefit. This is ahead of our prior expectations as we accelerated certain initiatives in 2020 with a particular focus on the highest return activities in response to COVID-19. As Bill referred to, we now expect the program to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits of $165 million in 2020, approximately $150 million more in 2021, with the full program generating $375 million exiting 2021. In terms of costs related to Project Summit, we now expect to spend closer to $200 million in 2020. We continue to expect the cost to implement the full program to be approximately $450 million. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we are operating from a position of significant balance sheet strength. In the third quarter, our team did a nice job delivering further cash cycle improvement with solid performance in both payables days and days sales outstanding. On a sequential basis, cash cycle improved by a full day as a result of continued DSO improvement. In August, the team executed another successful bond refinancing, issuing $1.1 billion to redeem our most restrictive outstanding debt and pay down a portion of the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility. The continued strong support received from the fixed income community provided us the opportunity to upsize our transaction while printing the lowest coupon for 10-year notes in the company’s history. Taken together with our bond offerings in June, we issued $3.5 billion of new debt on a leverage-neutral basis, increased our weighted average maturity by over two years to nearly eight years, while only modestly increasing our weighted average cost of debt. Additionally, these new bonds are more in line with our REIT peers as they include a fixed charge coverage ratio as opposed to a debt to EBITDA covenant. Also, I think it is worth noting that we have eliminated all of our 6.5 times leverage covenant bonds, meaning our most restrictive bond covenant is now 7 times debt to EBITDA.  At quarter end, we had $1.7 billion of liquidity. As a reminder, at the end of the second quarter, we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes from the June bond offering. We paid off the notes in early July, leaving us with a cash balance at September 30 of $152 million. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.3 times, which takes into account adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.5 times, which would represent an improvement year-on-year as we make progress towards our long term leverage range. With our strong financial position, our board of directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early January. Turning to capital expenditures, our full year expectation is now approximately $450 million, or a decrease of $75 million, reflecting development capital for our Frankfurt data center that will now be a part of our venture with AGC.  Now let me share a few thoughts as to our capital allocation strategy. First, we are committed to our dividend at this sustainable level and over time, we expect to glide into our targeted AFFO payout ratio of mid-60%. Second, we are committed to our target long term leverage range of 4.5 to 5.5 times on a net lease adjusted basis. This year, the team has made good progress toward our target.  As investors know, we have been allocating significant capital to our data center business for several years, and as our pipeline continues to build with high return investment opportunities, our strategic intent is to increase the amount of capital we dedicate to the business. With that, we have considered options to generate incremental funds for investment.  We view capital recycling as a good means to monetize certain assets, particularly industrial real estate to increasingly invest in our development pipeline. Industrial cap rate are at historically low levels, and we have the opportunity to structure long term leases on favorable terms that effectively allow us to have control of the facilities, whether we lease or own. With that, in the third quarter our team accessed the market and monetized two facilities for proceeds of approximately $110 million. This brings our year-to-date proceeds to nearly $120 million, ahead of our full year target of $100 million. With the highly favorable market backdrop together with our development pipeline, we are planning to recycle relatively more going forward, albeit what will amount to a small portion of our total industrial assets. Similarly, we view selling stabilized data center assets into a joint venture as analogous to monetizing industrial real estate assets - it represents another source of capital to redeploy into development projects. The joint venture we just announced in Frankfurt is a good example of this strategy. The JV provides us with an opportunity to boost returns on stabilized assets and provides incremental capital to allocate to projects in the development phase.  Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, while we are not issuing official guidance today, I would like to provide an update as to our expectations excluding any material and unforeseen changes With the continued impact of COVID, we are planning for the fourth quarter to be generally in line with the third quarter for revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a dollar basis, therefore for the full year 2020, this would lead to a low single digit revenue decline and flat to slightly positive adjusted EBITDA growth as compared to last year. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates approaching $60 million for revenue and $20 million for adjusted EBITDA. This outlook reflects our solid year-to-date performance, benefits from revenue management, accelerated Project Summit savings, and incorporates a cautious view for the fourth quarter. Given our favorable results, we now expect AFFO growth to be up low single digits for the full year. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our prior commentary.  When we look ahead to 2021, as you would expect, until we get COVID-19 behind us, naturally it is difficult to provide guidance, though we are committed to providing the investment community with additional commentary on our trajectory and underlying business trends, just as we’ve been doing throughout this year. While the challenges for our service business persist, we remain confident in its resiliency and the continued durability of our storage business. I am proud of how the team has responded to these challenges and the strong results we have delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that, Operator, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Today’s first question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. I just actually wanted to ask a little bit about the Frankfurt JV. Can you talk a little bit about how much do you cash in, how much debt the entity will incur? Just trying to understand how that was structured and whether that--you know, how well you did on that and is this really the kind of structure we can expect in the future for--you know, kind of build and then maybe sale with a joint venture.
Barry Hytinen: Sure, hi Shlomo. Good morning and thanks for the question. We really feel very good about the Frankfurt joint venture and what the team has done there with that fully leased up facility. We invested about $100 million at closing essentially with the deal. Over time we’ll cash out nearly all of that, in fact all of it, and nearly of all that at the close. We retained over 20% retained equity interest in the venture. We will earn fees for things like property management, development and construction, and we’ll take those proceeds and redeploy it into development pipeline, which has nice high return opportunities. So essentially, we see it as the opportunity to monetize essentially what is a stabilized asset, boost that return, and then redeploy. You asked about debt - yes, of course the entity would, as you’re expecting, have debt on it. That debt will approximate the incremental development costs, so that might be--over time that could be as much as a couple hundred million euros. We have a very attractive rate on that debt, I might add, and we feel very good about the way the development is proceeding. Bill, anything you’d like to add?
William Meaney: Yes, I think we’ve talked about it, Shlomo, a few times that we see that as a path that we would like to continue to follow. If you think about you have a fully stabilized data center asset, there is a lot of pension money or funds that manage pension money that are looking for mid-digit returns on an investment basis because it’s a fully stabilized asset with a very long contract, and we were able to find that both on the debt and the equity side, so it just makes sense to take that money and then plow it back into higher return projects.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Nate Crossett at Berenberg. Please go ahead.
Nate Crossett: Hey, good morning guys. Just following up on the JV, I was wondering if this is something that could be opened up to future projects with them, specifically what’s their appetite for further deals and why did you go with them?  My second question is on the organic storage revenue line, growth of 2.5%. How much of that growth can be attributed to data center growth, and then just on price increases, I was wondering if you’re getting any pushback from customers.
William Meaney: In terms of AGC, they do have an appetite for these things, and in fact they have a similar structure with a different customer in the United States, and we ran a process so I would expect that they would be interested in any further processes that we run down the path. I wouldn’t be surprised at all for us--to see us do other things with AGC, but it will depend on the location and the opportunity. I think in terms of your question on storage revenue growth, is that it was about 1.7% if you just look at the physical storage and took out the data center, so it goes from 2.5 to 1.7, but still strong positive growth based on some of the success that we’ve been having on the back of consumer, so really pleased both in terms of record management did better this quarter and also consumer is really starting to show that it’s starting to hit a groove. That being said, we do expect--you know, the quarters are going to kind of go backwards and forwards a little bit because consumer is a seasonal business, but we think the trajectory is moving in the right direction for both businesses.  On the pricing side, you can see actually that we are continuing to get roughly the three points of price that Barry highlighted. We don’t see any slowdown in that at all, and we have more to get in the emerging markets, which are relatively new to the game in terms of our revenue management processes, so good response from the customers. We’re still considered very much an essential business or essential service to our customers, so it’s a great position to be in.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thank you. Not to put another question on the data center, but from an accounting perspective, will you recognize that as kind of the revenue--is that below the line or will it be reflected in the revenue and EBITDA, or is that below the line based on just the equity JV?
Barry Hytinen: Good morning, this is Barry. Thanks for the question.  Yes, the JV will be an unconsolidated joint venture, and so the revenue and EBITDA will not be benefited from it, and you’d see it below the line, to your question. You will see a smaller amount for the management type fees that I mentioned that would flow through revenue and therefore EBITDA - that’s for things like property management, construction development. I think that answers your question, thanks.
Operator: The next question today comes from Sheila McGrath at Evercore. Please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath: Yes, good morning. You mentioned capital recycling as a source of capital. I was wondering if you could give us more detail - do you mean selling industrial facilities outright and relocating your boxes or are you doing sale-leaseback, and what are your capital allocation priorities for that capital besides data centers?
Barry Hytinen: Hi Sheila, this is Barry. Thanks for the question.  For the most part, you’d be thinking about sales-leasebacks in terms of what we’re talking about. The couple of opportunities we monetized in the most recent quarter were also sale-leasebacks. Frankly, we’re seeing very, very strong performance from the team as it relates to cap rates in light of where the market is - think something like sub-5, even 4. Then with relatively long term leases together with options to further renew, we have the ability to effectively control those facilities, we feel like whether we lease or own them.  We feel good about that monetization strategy, and then in terms of priorities, it really is into higher return IRR projects that are in the development pipeline. As you know, and you know the business really well, that’s focused principally on data center but not exclusively there, and so you should expect us to continue to recycle and likely step up that activity some going forward.
Sheila McGrath: Thank you.
Barry Hytinen: You’re welcome.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Michael Funk: Yes, thanks and good morning, and thank you for the questions. A couple, if I could. Going back to the digital transformation that you were talking about, working with customers there, can you help us think about comparing the revenue contribution from a customer transitioning to more of a digital solution versus a physical solution, and then where you see the growth opportunity there as well?
William Meaney: Thanks Michael. I think first of all, it’s that it’s incremental, it’s on top, so we don’t see a lot of people saying, we’re going to go digital and then stop physical. There’s a few cases of that, but usually people want to keep their physical records as well for proof, but where we see the digital transformation is really around the use. So if you think, a couple of examples--or either that, use and/or further downstream processing.  So the example I gave on the call about the mortgage processing is really about downstream processing, but we also have--and we talked about that, I think, a little bit on previous calls when we changed our service level agreements and really made a push on image on demand, we’ve seen one customer, for instance, in the U.K. that has fully embraced that, so they only take their retrievals now through image on demand. Any time they need a retrieval, we image it and we load it up onto the system, and they access it that way, which we--which for us, longer term, it’s a higher margin business for us than having vans on the road, and honestly environmentally it’s better. So really, kind of two bits. One is we’re getting into more processes, quite frankly, where we weren’t exposed before, so we’re helping them with the downstream processes, and then the other case is people are taking advantage of our image on demand, which for us is a more efficient way to get them the information back.
Operator: Thank you, and our next question today comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to dive deeper into service activity trends during and exiting the quarter. Can you provide the rate of year-over-year decline in service activity by month during 3Q and how the declines looked in October?
Barry Hytinen: Sure George - hi, this is Barry. Thanks for the question.  For the--if you recall in July, we mentioned that total service activities were down kind of mid to high 20s for the quarter. If you look at new boxes inbounded, they average about 31%. October is slightly below that level and September was, as you might expect, the best performance of the quarter in light of trajectory we’ve been mentioning, and that really is the case for all of the other service activities - they’re generally following the same trajectory.  I would say that we look at--going forward, we’d use the September-October levels as being indicative of what we’re expecting, and that’s embedded in the forward outlook that we mentioned as it relates to third quarter and fourth quarter looking sort of similar in terms of revenue and EBITDA.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Great, two questions, if I could. The first one on the data center business, wondering if you could let us know of what your leasing this quarter--the split was between more hyperscale logos versus enterprise. Typically hyperscale is lower return, so could you update us on whether your approach has changed at all, whether you’re actively looking for more hyperscale business or if that’s just more reflective of the market this year, and then what the targeted deals you’re looking at are in the data center business and how that breaks out between those two customer segments. Then Barry, just quickly on the guidance, I know you said flat revenue and EBITDA for Q4. I’m wondering if that implies--how you split that out between service and storage, should we expect service to maybe be flat to slightly down and storage up, or if there’s anything to call out in Q4. Thank you.
William Meaney: Thanks Eric for the question.  I wouldn’t say that we’re going more for hyperscale than we’ve always espoused. I think we’ve always said for large campuses, we’d expect somewhere between 40% and 60% of the campus to be hyperscale and the rest to be co-lo or retail, but this year it may be a little bit more noticeable because the gestation period in terms of that marketing takes a while. Our relationship as we went into data centers for sure was stronger on the enterprise side, setting up project cloud for large enterprise customers than it was on the hyperscale, so this year we’re actually really pleased with the progress we’ve made in terms of building our reputation and exposure with the hyperscale. If you look at year to date, we’re about 50/50, so about 50% of that 51 megawatts that we’ve signed up here to date is hyperscale, including obviously the Frankfurt site, and about 50% is retail, so we’re really happy with the mix. But for sure you’re right, is that the cash and cash returns on hyperscale deployments are lower, but they’re longer term contracts and it allows you to build out the facilities or the campuses faster, so it still is the right mix, we think in terms of maximizing returns.
Barry Hytinen: Eric, it’s Barry. Thanks for the question. As it relates to fourth quarter, I would say that we’re working with a modeling of service revenue decline being similar in nature Q3-Q4 versus prior year, and that’s what’s essentially embedded in that outlook. That should work through--you’ll be able to work through the storage number. I would note that that’s aligned with my answer to George earlier about where we see activity levels as being fairly consistent to slightly better. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, if you’d like to ask a question, please press star then one. Today’s next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. Can you just comment a little bit about the step-up in fine arts volume? It’s something that we really haven’t seen for a while, and I’m wondering what’s driving that.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks Shlomo. It’s actually in our entertainment services, and the real improvement in physical I think, beyond a sustainable basis, is on the consumer side, so that was more of a true-up in terms of some private vaults that we had with our entertainment services. If you look overall, if you think about the overall record management down about 1.1 million cubic feet, consumer was up 2.5, and then I would say it was kind of a one-off true-up of a little over half a million cubes with entertainment services.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-06 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greer Aviv: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We have provided the user-controlled slides on our Investor Relations website. We will also be providing a link to today’s webcast and earnings materials. We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, President and CEO; and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including how we are successfully navigating the COVID-19 environment, how we have continued to see durability in our core Storage business, how we have continued to see strength in our Data Center business, how we are progressing on our Transformation Program with Project Summit, and how we as an organization are reflecting and acting on the recent events, highlighting continued social injustice with regards diversity broadly and of black population specifically. After our prepared remarks, we’ll open up the lines for Q&A. Today’s earnings materials will contain forward-looking statements. We have noted the impacts of COVID-19 and our expectations of how that may impact our operations and financial performance in 2020. We have also noted our expectations for Project Summit. As you know, all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today’s earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on the Slide 2 and our annual report on Form 10-K and other periodic SEC filings for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. We have included the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg-G in our supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. Let me start by saying I hope you’re all continued to stay safe and healthy in these trying times. Before we get into a discussion of our second quarter performance, I’d like to take some time to touch on 2 topics that are top of mind for many of us in the current environment. First, the killings of George Floyd and countless others have left me and my colleagues upset, angered and heartbroken. I want to reiterate that racism, discrimination and hate have no place at Iron Mountain. Our commitment and stated as one of our core 5 values for many years, to equality, inclusivity and diversity is part of our belief that our people are our greatest assets. Given this fact, we must continually attract, listen to and develop a broad talent pool reflecting our global demographics in order to deliver to our customers and protect our future. These tragic events have sparked difficult but important self-reflection in conversations within our organization about how well we are living up to our stated value and to commit ourselves to do much better. It is up to us to work together, educate ourselves and encourage open dialogue to promote proactive measures to help eliminate incorrect biases and spread awareness, not just because it is the right thing to do, but also because we will only be successful in serving our customers if we attract and retain the best talent. Having the best talent can only happen if we are recruiting and developing people from diverse backgrounds across the broader demographics we operate in. We remain strongly committed toward taking decisive and strategic action to create a truly inclusive Iron Mountain. We’re committed to listening, learning and taking the necessary actions to support long-term positive change for the black community specifically, and people from all backgrounds in general. Whilst we cannot change the past, we have an opportunity as an organization and as individuals to positively impact the future and help fix the racial inequality prevalent in our society. Now, I’d like to update you on the impact we are seeing with respect to COVID-19. As you all know, the virus is unfortunately still spreading across the globe. My thoughts and prayers go out to all those who have been affected by the virus, including those who have fallen ill as well as their loved ones and their caregivers. As always, our top priority remains the health and safety of our Mountaineers, their families and our customers. I want to acknowledge and thank the mighty Mountaineers around the world, who despite extraordinary challenges have kept their focus on ensuring that Iron Mountain continues to move forward during these uncertain times, and doing so with a view towards safety. This is all [brought home] [ph] to me again last week, during a visit I made to Northern New Jersey, so I could thank our frontline teams personally. One of our couriers relayed how he has been serving a large metro New York health system every day through the crisis and how thankful the customer is for our continued service. This particular customer went so far to send one of their doctors to our facility to assist in the protocols and training to protect our staff. For me, this is what it means to be in a true partnership with our customers. Whilst we continue to serve many customers during this crisis, as you would expect our second quarter results were impacted by disruptions due to office closures and other restrictions put in place as a result of COVID-19. Fortunately, 100% of our records management facilities are now open and operating across the globe. However, many of our global customers continue to operate at significantly lower capacities due to existing restrictions depending on geography. As a result, global demand for many of our core service offerings declined during the quarter. Looking back, no one could have anticipated the magnitude of the impact from this pandemic on the global economy and our own business. However, our team moved quickly to assess the risks, understand the consequences, and take decisive action to ensure the safety of our employees, customers and communities. As I mentioned, these various decisions have not been made lightly. And we are aware of their consequences, especially for our Mountaineers that have been impacted by furloughs and other temporary, and in some cases, permanent actions. We told you in May that approximately a third of our global workforce has been impacted by these actions in an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity. Fortunately, we have been able to bring a number of our Mountaineers back to work. So at this time, this number has decreased to approximately 20% of our global workforce. Furthermore, the mix has shifted over the past few months, so fewer of the impacted employees are on full furlough, and a higher percentage are working reduced hours, or using vacation or sick times. At this time, we have also reopened all our corporate offices with the exception of London, which we plan to open at the beginning of September. We are practicing strict protocols around social distancing. And as such, the majority of our salaried workforce is continuing to work remotely. We should know we have been strong – we have seen strong productivity rates with working from home. That being said, given some of the increased stresses of working remotely, we continue to monitor and care for our Mountaineers’ mental health and resiliency as part of our overall focus on wellness. Turning to our financial performance, our continued navigation of this challenging and uncertain environment has delivered a second quarter performance that further demonstrates, improves the durability and resilience of our people, and ultimately, our business model. I’ll touch on a few highlights here. Q2 constant currency revenue declined $58 million or 5.6% year-over-year, driven entirely by a 21% decline in our service revenue. This was partly offset by strong storage revenue growth, which increased 3.7%. The early benefits of Project Summit are evident as we delivered constant currency adjusted EBITDA line, in line with the year-ago level despite the revenue decline, leading to a 200 basis point margin expansion. Barry will review the rest of the Q2 financials in more detail. Looking at our service business, we have seen improvements in activity levels across the various product lines since the end of April as global economies are starting to reopen and customers are increasingly utilizing our core service offerings in many geographies. However, the pace of our recovery still remains uncertain. Whilst the revenue decline wasn’t as steep as we expected when we last spoke in early May, we continue to see some risk around the second half, depending upon what happens with the progression of the virus and possible additional restrictions on a country-by-country and state-by-state basis, as they continue to fight specific localized outbreaks of the virus. Turning now to our core Storage business, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3% supported by strong revenue management contribution. Moreover, we saw cash collections improve both in absolute terms year-on-year as well as by 2 days outstanding. This level of organic revenue growth underscores the durability and essential nature of our Storage business and our ability to continue to generate substantial cash flow. Total organic volume declined 1.8 million cubic feet sequentially, contributing to this decrease was in records management volume, partly offset a 2 million cubic foot increase in consumer and others. Looking more specifically at records management organic volume, this was down 3.9 million cubic feet compared to the first quarter. This shouldn’t be surprising based on the decline of incoming boxes in April and a decline of 45% for the quarter. We have been asked by many investors as to what we see happening to physical volume post-COVID. So let me take a step back and provide some further context on organic records management volume. We estimate that the impact from COVID in Q2 was somewhere between 4 and 4.5 million cubic feet, net of a slowdown in permanent withdrawals. If we continue to normalize Q2 for similar levels of volume in Q1 combined with our expectation for a pickup in permanent withdrawals, volume would be flat to slightly up on a normalized basis. To get to a total physical volume impact, I will now be factoring consumer performance. In the second quarter, we added 2 million cubic feet, analyzing this would imply we would be net positive 8 million cubic feet or approximately 1% volume growth on a base of total physical volume of more than 720 million cubic feet. However, Q2 is a seasonally highest point for consumer business, so this would be overly optimistic to assume for a full year. When we net all this out in a post-COVID world, we would expect physical storage volume growth to be roughly a 0.5% with volume from records management flat to slightly up with a small net positive growth coming from consumer. It should be noted that this is all before the contribution from our normal price increases, which generally add approximately 2% to 3% to the volume growth, yielding approximately 3% organic storage revenue growth from the physical side of the business. However, when we will see this reversion to post-COVID normalized business environment remains uncertain, and it’s certainly not before the end – before the second half of 2021. Despite the stress constraints from dealing with COVID’s impact, we have not led up on our investments in innovation. Specifically in the quarter, we had many instances where we were able to serve our customers with a focus on delivering innovative solutions in order to help them navigate their challenges that have arisen from COVID-19. For example, regarding the commercial impact, in April, pipeline of more traditional offerings was down 40% versus the same period last year due to COVID in the resulting lower economic activity. However, we recovered one-third of this loss through new solutions we recently launched that help address our customers’ needs during this time. This is just one demonstration of the resiliency and dedication of our mountaineers as we expect many of these solutions to be additive to our top and bottom lines even after our base activities rebound. Turning now to our Global Data Center segment. This business continues to perform exceptionally well, delivering strong results in the second quarter. In June, we announced a 27-megawatt data center lease with a U.S.-based Fortune 100 customer in Frankfurt, Germany. This customer will occupy the entire Frankfurt facility which should result in stabilization significantly sooner than we originally anticipated when we purchased the land last year. In addition, we signed a 3-megawatt data center lease with a Fortune Global 200 company in Singapore, another signal of strong momentum in that market. These bigger deals have been won alongside a series of smaller but significant agreements including a number of new logos. We welcomed an online gaming platform, a state government and a global logistics supplier provided to the IMDC ecosystem in Q2. All of this is contributed to a strong performance in the first half of the year with nearly 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases signed against our initial guidance of 15 to 20 megawatts for the full year. Given this great success in the first half of the year, we now expect to be able to sign leases for a total of 45 to 50 megawatts this year or an additional 10-plus megawatts of leasing in the back half. I’d like to congratulate the entire data center team for an exceptional first half performance. Thank you. Based on the strength of our pipeline, we will continue to prioritize investment in data center growth. We are actively building our capacity across our global footprint with new development projects started in Amsterdam, Singapore and Phoenix. In early July, we completed the first phase of 4 megawatts and our new building on our Northern Virginia Campus, and customers are already deploying. As I mentioned earlier, Projects Submit is already paying dividends. No one could have predicted the depth or breadth of this pandemic when we first announced Project Summit in October 2019. Thankfully, the decisive actions we took early in the program allowed us to reconfigure our cost structure as well as realigned our organization to be more nimble and customer centric. These changes enabled us to be more responsive in delivering new solutions to our customers’ specific needs during the crisis as well as matching our costs to a changing demand environment. In addition to the cost reduction Project Summit has achieved as demonstrated by our increased margin, we’ve also made progress on the next phase and improving our customer intelligence as well as simplifying our IT systems, one such example being our master data management initiative. Through this initiative, we’re improving the platforms and processes that handle all of our data. This intelligence will allow us to better understand and serve our customers making data and asset for our business. Finally, I’m also very pleased with the initial success we have seen from the recent changes to our service delivery model. The rollout of the SLA changes or service level agreement changes we discussed last quarter had gone smoothly. We have already seen the early benefits of denser routes and less frequent pickups and deliveries. Our Image on Demand service has seen an increase in activity as more customers look for solutions, which include the use of digital solutions, as it helps them integrate more contactless process to reduce infection risk at their businesses. A recent survey indicated that more of our customers are interested in converting to digital versus physical delivery. In particular, our customers tell us they value speed of delivery, ease of use, and security as the most important considerations when evaluating the use of Image on Demand. To summarize, there is no doubt that COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to our business. However, this challenge provided confirmation that the changes we have made to our organization and the investments we have made in the recent past were the right ones. COVID-19 accelerated many workplace trends, and we have demonstrated that we can provide the necessary solutions to help our customers adapt to their new unexpected work environment. Despite the unprecedented volatility of COVID-19, we remain focused on long-term growth and doing what’s right for the health of our employees, our customers and our business. Importantly, we have also recommitted ourselves in our fight against racial injustice prevalent in our societies around the globe, and in creating an inclusive and diverse workforce. We are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet and a durable business model, which are helping us successfully navigate this challenging period, whilst providing us with the flexibility to continue investing in our long-term growth plans, which go beyond Project Summit. As Barry shared with you last quarter, we are proactively managing expenses and have additional levers to further adjust our cost structure if necessary and appropriate. In closing, whilst the hide degree of uncertainty remains as we look to the back half of the year, we are confident that the value of our offerings is more relevant to our customers today, and we will continue to provide innovative products and services that address their evolving business needs. Our confidence is further shared by our bondholders as evidenced by our $2.4 billion issuance to refinance some of our notes. Strong investor confidence and demand allowed us to upsize our transaction, as well as extend our maturity profile. On behalf of the leadership team, I wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our frontline mountaineers, who have kept our operations running seamlessly to serve our customers. Stay safe and well. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. I want to echo Bill’s comments. I hope you all continue to be safe and healthy. We are pleased with our results for the second quarter. In a challenging macro environment, our team delivered solid performance across each of our key financial metrics, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and AFFO. Before I go into the detail of the – our results, let me touch on the impact COVID-19 has had on our service trends. As we noted on our last conference call, for the second quarter, we were planning for service declines consistent with what we experienced in April. This proved to be slightly conservative. While May was consistent with April, we saw an improving trend across most of our service lines in June. To provide investors with as much visibility as possible, I want to share more information than we typically do, including the monthly progression of service activity. As compared to last year, our global service activities declined 37% in April, 38% in May, and 21% in June. This resulted in an average decline for the second quarter of 32%. While trends have naturally varied some by market, these are generally representative of what we’ve experienced around the globe. A notable call out is Latin America, where consistent with macro headlines, the business has generally lagged the recovery elsewhere. To put that in context, this region represents approximately 5% of our revenue. In North America, we saw a year-on-year decline of 36% in April, 37% in May, and 22% in June. Our core storage business, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability, has demonstrated its durability as we continue to grow organic storage rental revenue during the pandemic. As a reminder, the stability of this business is built on the fact that over 97% of our annual storage revenue is generated by boxes that entered our facilities in prior years. And now turning to enterprise results for the second quarter, revenue of $982 million decreased 7.9% on a reported basis year-on-year, reflecting service declines as well as the stronger dollar. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined 5.6%. Total organic revenue declined 7.2%. Organic service revenue declined 23.1% reflecting the COVID impact. Despite the macro headwinds, total organic storage rental revenue grew 2.3% supported by revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA declined 2.3% to $343 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, adjusted EBITDA was in line with last year, despite a $58 million revenue decline. During the second quarter, we incurred $9 million of costs as a result of COVID-19 for items such as PPE and specialized cleaning of our facilities, which have been excluded from our non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 200 basis points year-over-year to 34.9%. The improvement reflects progress on our Summit transformation, revenue management and favorable mix. Adjusted EPS was $0.22 compared to $0.23 in the second quarter of 2019. Our full year expectations for tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from our commentary last quarter. AFFO was $249 million, up 19% year-over-year. As compared to adjusted EBITDA, the increase in AFFO was primarily driven by tax refund. Turning to segment performance, starting with the global RIM organization. In the second quarter records management experienced year-on-year declines of approximately 45% for new boxes inbounded and 43% for retrievals and refiles. Permanent withdrawals declined 34% and destructions were down 1%. Data management saw less of an impact with activity down 10%. Our global digital solutions business has continued to perform well with revenue consistent year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Given the diverse mix of products and services in this business, we use revenue as the best indicator of activity. In our shred business, activity declined approximately 24%, which has also resulted in lower paper tonnage. The industry saw an increase in the price for recycled paper in April and May, which we believe was partially the result of elevated consumer purchases of paper products. For the second quarter, our average realized price was 15% higher than the prior year, which was a $2 million benefit to adjusted EBITDA. Prices continued to be volatile with sequential declines in June and July. The consumer storage business has seen an increase in demand and performed ahead of our expectations. These service activity levels contributed to a total organic revenue decline of 7.5% in the global RIM business. The decline was partially offset by storage volume growth in faster growing markets and revenue management. In the second quarter, we took aggressive actions including furloughs and reduced work hours which helped bring costs more in line with activity levels. Naturally, we also experienced a level of fixed costs deleverage. As these cost actions are temporary in nature and distinct from Project Summit, we continue to expect them to come back as revenue recovers. Our global RIM business delivered adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 240 basis points to 43.8%. This improvement was driven by Project Summit, revenue management and favorable next. Turning to Global Data Center, the business delivered organic revenue growth of 7.6% driven by strong leasing in prior periods and low churn of 80 basis points. This was partially offset by a mark-to-market decline in Phoenix resulting from an early contract renewal of a large legacy I/O customer. Global Data Center’s adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% represents an increase of 140 basis points consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion as our platform scales. As Bill noted, the data center team delivered very strong bookings in the first half of the year signing almost 39 megawatts of new and expansion leases including pre-leasing 100% of our Frankfurt facility currently under development. As we have said before, we are reviewing potential third-party capital options, particularly related to stabilized assets, and we will keep you updated in the second half. Turning to our adjacent businesses, the fine arts industry has continued to experience the impact of COVID and we have seen activity down approximately 85%. On the other hand, our entertainment services business has shown resilience as activity has remained in line with pre-COVID levels. As to Project Summit, in the second quarter we recognized $39 million of restructuring charges and an adjusted EBITDA benefit of $40 million. Through the first half, we have delivered $65 million of benefit. We continue to expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit of $150 million and restructuring charges of $240 million in 2020. This keeps us on pace to deliver $375 million of expected total program benefits exiting 2021. And turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we are confident in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the second quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement of nearly 4 days year-on-year, with benefits coming from both payables’ days and days sales outstanding. We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long term. With the COVID backdrop, I think the team’s performance, particularly on cash collections was very strong. Despite a decline in revenue, our cash collections were up year-on-year in June. I will note that given the pandemics’ impact on the macro-economy, we took a prudent view regarding receivables and increased our bad debt expense in the quarter. I’d like to briefly expand on the recent bond offering that Bill mentioned. We appreciate the investment community’s strong support which resulted in our ability to upsize the transaction in June to $2.4 billion. This leverage neutral offering increased our weighted average maturity by almost 2 years while only modestly increasing our cost of debt. In the second quarter, we recognized debt extinguishment charges of approximately $17 million related to a write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and call premiums. Due to the timing of the payoff of one of our notes, at quarter end we had elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet. We paid off that note on July 2, and as a result, we anticipate recording an additional $15 million of debt extinguishment charge in the third quarter. Pro forma for this payoff, we had $1.2 billion of liquidity, which provides us ample runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. We have been able to maintain liquidity at this level since April even while continuing to fund innovation and growth initiatives as well as supporting our sustainable dividend. We ended the quarter with net lease adjusted leverage of 5.4 times, which takes into account certain adjustments as described in our credit facility. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with leverage of approximately 5.6 times, which would represent a slight decline year-on-year as we make progress toward our long-term leverage range. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share to be paid in early October. Now, let me provide an update as to our expectations for the remainder of the year. With the impact of COVID, we are planning for reported revenue to be down less than 5% for the full year compared to 2019. This outlook includes a full year headwind from foreign exchange rates of approximately $75 million for revenue and almost $25 million for adjusted EBITDA as compared to last year. Turning to our expectations for our Storage and Service businesses, for the full year we currently expect a decline in net organic storage volume of 1% to 1.5%. We expect reported storage rental revenue in the second half to grow on year-on-year at a rate that approaches what we delivered in the second quarter. As to Service, our July activity levels were down 24% globally. We are currently planning for third-quarter activity to be consistent with what we experienced in July. This implies a service revenue decline in high-teens year-on-year in the third quarter. With an expectation for a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter, we are planning for full-year service revenue declines in the mid-teens. We are approaching adjusted EBITDA margins with a level of conservatism and plan for both the third and fourth quarters to be flat to slightly up year-on-year. This would result in us delivering full-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion slightly above 100 basis points relative as to last year, which reflects an improvement as compared to our comments on our last call. This reflects our solid first-half performance benefits from revenue management Project Summit and other cost actions, as well as a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. Turning to capital expenditures, we have increased our full-year expectation to approximately $525 million or an increase of $50 million from the midpoint of our previous outlook. You should expect this increase to be evenly split between recurring CapEx and data center growth investment, given the better-than-expected performance in the core business, as well as our growing data center pipeline. As to AFFO, the team is focused on delivering at a level approaching last year’s results, including the benefit of our second quarter tax refund. As it relates to capital recycling, our outlook has not changed. We continue to expect to generate proceeds of approximately $100 million this year. As we look at the back half, we have a strong pipeline of transactions and continue to see attractive valuations with historically low cap rates in the industrial real estate market. While second quarter was a challenging one for our Service business, we are confident in its resiliency and the continued durability of our Storage business. I am proud of how the team has responded to these challenges and the strong results they have delivered. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our third quarter earnings call. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today’s first question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Right. Thanks for taking the question. Bill, you mentioned that you had launched some new solutions for your customers in the quarter that helped recover some of your sales losses. So I’m wondering if you could maybe provide a little more color on what type solutions you’re offering and any impact you think that could have? And then, I guess, just one follow-up, on the data center build out, you have mentioned that you were looking at third-party capital options. I’m wondering if that facility is related to the Frankfurt lease or if there are potentially other assets that you could look to potentially a joint venture. Thanks.
William Meaney: Okay. I’ll let Barry answer the last one in more detail. I think the answer to – the short answer to your question is, yeah, we continue to like the idea of third-party capital for stabilized assets. But I’ll let Barry give you a full answer on that. On the first one, in terms – so, thanks for the question, Eric, on innovation and the importance of that, not just in a post-COVID world, but absolutely in the current environment. We continue to see traction on some of the things I highlighted last time in terms of what I call remote collaboration and collaborating remotely. Like I gave the example last time I think on unemployment benefits, where we’re actually facilitating folks to be able to be working away from home and both receive the application for unemployment and approve it, and then, also some of the areas around mailroom which, again, I think I highlighted last time. One area I would add in addition to that, so we continue to see more and more traction for those kinds of solutions. One area too that we’ve seen, a good uptick in the recent past is what we call our Clean Start program. And the Clean Start program is something that we launched a year ago, which is really helping people to re-imagine their needs to their office space, and get information flows to be more seamless when they’re at work, and then, also to get things off site for things that they don’t need around the office and it allows them to work in a much more flexible way. When we came into COVID that actually got – the brakes got put on that, because part of the Clean Start was, we would go into offices and do surveys and help – working with their real estate people to help them re-imagine and rebuild their work processes. And some of that, the exhaust of that process, obviously, is storage, but also some of the other services that we provide is Iron Mountain. When we got into the crisis, our real estate team product management, sales and marketing team collaborated and they created a Clean Start kit in a box, if you will. So what we’ve done is we’ve been able to put that together in a kit that allows us to deliver the same type of assessment in survey virtually without actually going into their offices. And we just recently, for instance, had a very large win with a global insurance company that was selling part of its insurance portfolio to a life insurance company, where we not only did facilitated moving sensitive records, many containing PII or Personally Identifiable Information across to that new owner of those policies and that information, but transfer a number of their employees across and at the same time help them repurpose the real estate footprint that they were left with. So it was kind of real estate optimization, helping them transfer a business to another person, transfer of people and then take a step back and say how can we actually improve the information flow in what they have left. So it just gives you another flavor of the types of things that we’re finding out there.
Barry Hytinen: And, Eric, hey, it’s Barry. Thanks for the question. Just to add a little bit on to Bill’s comments there, earlier in the year, we noted that we were going to pause our third-party capital. Look, as we were working through the pre-leasing activity, we noted that the pipeline was very attractive, specifically on Frankfurt. Obviously, the team did a phenomenal job in the quarter with that and as well as broader data center business. So we are looking at third-party capital, Frankfurt in particular. But I would never say never as it relates to other stabilized assets. We think it’s an attractive way to improve returns for the company and we see a lot of opportunity there. I would say that implied in your question was the comment around JV. We do think that that’s an attractive structure. You’ve seen that done in the industry before I know. And I think at this point, what we’ll say is we will come back to you quarter by quarter and give you an update as how we’re progressing there. Thanks for the question.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Adam Walsh: Hey, this is Adam on for Shlomo. On the Services business looks like the revenue decline wasn’t near as high as at least we were thinking. One, what percentage of the client facilities are accessible to the company’s services business? And two, how much did the paper price – increased paper price has offset the volume decline in the shredding business in the quarter?
William Meaney: Oh, okay. Hey, Adam. Thanks for the question. A couple of points there, I would say, look, our service business performed better throughout – in the quarter than we had anticipated. As you know, on the last call, we noted that we thought we’d use April as a proxy going forward for the entire second quarter. April and May, generally speaking, really across the world and across our various service activity lines were very consistent. Shred was down kind of high 20%s in April, about 30% in May. It also recovered just like directionally the rest of the business was down in the vicinity of 10% on activity basis in June and kind of stayed at that level in July. I would say that, that trajectory of improvement in June, as I noted, was really pervasive across all of our activities. As it relates to paper price, in particular, the way I would think about this, Adam, is on our last call, we were – well, in the first quarter, we had a $10 million hit to EBITDA from paper prices, as you recall. In – on our last call, we thought that we would have kind of low- to mid-single-digit dollar decline as a result of paper price for each of the next couple of quarters. We actually had a $2 million positive to EBITDA as I mentioned on the call. Now, I will say that paper prices have been very volatile and have been declining quite significantly over the last couple of months, you’ve probably seen that in the industry data, I know you follow that. And so our view for the back half is that it will be basically neutral year-on-year as it relates to EBITDA. So thanks for the question, Adam.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on what percentage of the new data center leasing is from existing Iron Mountain customers? Just more details on synergies there. And if you can comment on how the global sales relationship strategy might be going?
Barry Hytinen: Okay. Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question. So, first of all, as we look at this quarter is most of the sales were from relative – either from new logos or hyperscalers that were the first time deploying in a hyperscale way, if you know what I mean. In other words, we – most of the hyperscalers, we were serving in some aspects, but not necessarily in large hyperscale deployment. I think overall, though, if you look at our pipeline, I would say that whilst it’s right to say on – in terms of volume, that we would sell this, that one hyperscaler, you can kind of skew what that looks like is we’re still seeing a good mix. So I think last quarter, we were approaching back up to about 50% from kind of existing Iron Mountain or existing data center customers. This quarter, it was a little bit lower, especially if you use the filter I’m saying, breaking the hyperscalers into 2 buckets. But – overall, I think we still continue to see the pipeline, I think that some of the new logos that I highlighted, that we brought in this time were because of existing Iron Mountain relationships and say our data management business and the type of cross selling that you would see. But if you look at specifically this quarter, what we’re most excited about this quarter is that, we think, we’re beginning to be established in the deal flow, if you will, for hyperscale deployment. In other words, hyperscalers know that we’re out there, and we see – we’re seeing the RFIs, just like everybody else, so we’re pretty excited. So this quarter was kind of skewed, I would say to kind of newish customers. But overall, the pipeline is still kind of in that 50% level.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today’s next question comes from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please go ahead.
Nate Crossett: Hey, good morning, guys. A couple of questions. For the organic storage revenue, it was up 2.3%. Kind of wondering if you could speak to that a bit. How much of that growth is coming from data centers now? How much is coming from the rest? And have you had any pushback on pricing increases during COVID? And then on the DCs, I’m just wondering, do you worry that if you start doing JVs for the DCs that you’re going to get less credit for this growing business?
Barry Hytinen: Hey, Nate. This is Barry. Thanks for your both questions. So data center contributed 40 basis points to that number. So it really speaks to the fact that it’s a nice contributor, and we expect obviously that to ramp over time as that is, as you know, a big focus for the company. We see a long-term trajectory for continued growth there. And, as I said earlier, the team is just doing really well. And that also speaks, I think, to the fact that our records management business continues to see nice growth and revenue management really contributing very, very well. As it relates to credit, as it relates to structure, I think it’s a little premature to talk too much about what we do there. As it relates to third-party capital, we know that we’re just evaluating but as it relates to stabilized assets, we do think that where various rates are in terms of certain folks that are willing to invest in this kind of market, it makes for very enhanced returns. And we think it’s also another opportunity to help fuel incremental growth. Bill, did you have anything you want to add?
William Meaney: Yeah. The only thing, Nate, I would add on the pricing side, because I think your question, regarding your questions a little bit, in this environment, do you still – are you still seeing the same stickiness? The thing that – we knew that we were an essential business based on government authorities. As I said, even at the peak, we were 96% of our facilities were open around the globe. Now it’s 100%. But the one thing that we’ve seen is that we’ve been able to continue to get the price increases that we expected, our customers really see us as essential as well. And that was further reinforced. I think, Barry highlighted in his introductory remarks that in the month of June, not only the DSOs go down year-on-year, but the month of June with lower sales, we collected more cash than we did June last year. So in other words, people really do see that our services are essential to keep their businesses up and running. So we haven’t seen any really noise around the price increases that we were able to achieve last year in the current environment.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks for the questions, Nate.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Atkin: Thank you. I’ve got couple of questions on the data center side, if you could maybe comment on Amsterdam and then Singapore, each of which have seen some non-COVID-related pauses or freezes in terms of new permitting, and may or may not affect you equally in both markets, but just it has had some impact on your competitors. And is there kind of any sort of an update as to the lifting of these pauses in each of those metros. Thanks.
William Meaney: Thanks, Jon. It’s good to hear this morning. So I think first of all, the market extreme – both of those markets extremely well. So first on Singapore, we’re continuing to keep an eye on it, because, as you probably realize, we’re tracking on a track that we’re going to be sold out in Singapore pretty soon. So you’re right that the government has put a pause on it. We have heard the – it just so happens that our head of Asia data centers is a Singaporean based in Singapore. So he stays pretty close to the government. We are seeing that the government seems to be making noises to relax that a little bit sooner than they initially guided, say, a year ago. So we’re optimistic. And obviously we’re starting to or have been for a number of months now looking at how we could actually expand our footprint in Singapore. As I said the – we’re well on track to fill out the old Credit Suisse data center fairly soon. On Amsterdam, interesting, we have actually quite a bit of land permitted. So we’ve been less engaged with the government trying to relax that. On the other side, it’s exactly as you said is, we’ve seen even a number of people who have their own data centers in the Amsterdam market, for instance, coming in and starting to look to add capacity in our facilities, because of the permitting issue that you’ve described. And obviously, Amsterdam is a highly connected market in our facility as a high level of connectivity within it. So it’s actually playing through our strength, because we have the capacity in – but the rest of the market is constrained.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today’s next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail on Project Summit, how it’s going versus your expectations. And for the $65 million benefit realized thus far, where are those savings come from? And what are some of the sources of the future savings? And one last one for Barry. What was the tax refund related to just more detail on that?
William Meaney: Okay, Sheila. Good morning and thanks for those questions. First off, we feel great about how Summit is doing. I think, the team is very aligned and they’re very focused on delivering. I think the total company is energized by the fact that this is really an opportunity to transform the company and support our customers that much better. In terms of how it’s stacking up, the second quarter of $40 million benefit year-on-year was right in line, if not a little bit ahead of what we were expecting. So we’re at $65 million year-to-date, obviously, those are elevated levels as compared to what we were expecting earlier as we increase the benefit this year last quarter. So we’re well on track to deliver $150 million of benefit this year. My guess is that next year, we will have another $150 million to $200 million of incremental benefit. And we’ll exit next year at a run rate that has all of the benefits the entire $375 million by 2022. So a little small amount of incremental benefit there in 2022 to plan for your models in terms of where it’s coming from. It’s generally been thus far, probably in the vicinity of 70%, 75% from SG&A and the balance and cost of sales. You’ll notice you’re looking at our performance this quarter, our cost of sales, obviously, down a lot more and that reflects the fact that we made those temporary cost cuts that we talked about in the form of furloughs and et cetera. Going forward, I think, you’ll see even more of Summit coming from a more balanced approach across the income statement. As initially as Bill, as commented before, the first rounds of summit were really in the SG&A area. There will be more going forward. But I think as a relative basis, sort of last quarter, we talked some about the SLA changes, which by the way, are going very, very well. Those will continue to stack incremental benefits going forward. And some of that, obviously, will be in the cost of sales line. As it relates to the tax refund, I think that was the last question. We did have about $27 million of cash refunds in the quarter as compared to prior year. Last year, we actually paid more on a cash basis. So if you’re looking at AFFO, it’s almost a $35 million swing year-on-year. That’s one time. And we – those are for prior-year refunds that we received during the quarter. So thanks for those questions, Sheila.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Michael Funk with BoA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Michael Funk: Yeah, thank you for the question, guys. Good morning.
William Meaney: Good morning.
Michael Funk: A couple if I could, can you comment some more on the churn that you’re seeing? Any kind of update on the monthly progression for customer churn?
William Meaney: Yeah, I didn’t quite get the question, Michael. It was a customer churn on data center or customer churn in the records business?
Michael Funk: Yeah, sorry about that, on the records business, please.
William Meaney: On the records business, yeah. So, look, the customer churn is actually we think a little bit lower than normal than we would see. So that’s when I made the comment in my introductory remarks that when we kind of normalize in a post-COVID world on one side, we would expect a pause. In other words, we don’t expect the same drag on incoming volume, but on permanent withdrawals is that we saw a downtick in this quarter, because people are not in the office or making active decisions to actually withdraw. So we expected to kind of revert back to the normal levels. But if you kind of look at overall volume, I think the question behind your question is, what do we think is going to happen to volume when we get out of COVID. So on one side we would expect permanent withdrawals to go up, back to normalized levels. But on the other side is we would expect the incoming volume from our customers to come back up. And so that gives you kind of a bit of science around that if it’s helpful. Let’s first of all, kind of anchor on what we see with our customers right now in this environment in terms of activity. So last week when I was in New York, in New Jersey, and had to catch up with one evening with the President and Chief Operating Officer of a large global bank that’s based in New York. And we were comparing notes on how many people come back to the office, et cetera. And what he shared with me is that at the depth of the crisis, say, in April, they had less than 3% of their workforce coming into the office. And whether you’re standing – when I was meeting with them last week in July, they had invited 20% of the people to come back, and only 6% came back. And you’re probably seeing similar things in BAML. So then, let’s kind of say, how is that translated in the activity we see in terms of incoming boxes; when I say that, where are we going to end when we have COVID in the rearview mirror? So if we look at incoming boxes in April, so if you remember, like in their case, only 3% of their people, less than 3% of their people were coming into the office. We were down 58% in North America. If I’m just taking North America as an example as that is a proxy, we’re down 58% on incoming box volume. If we look at the quarter, as Barry mentioned, we’re down about 47% overall in North America in terms of incoming box. Now, if you looked at July, we’re down about 38%. So basically July is about a 20% improvement from what we saw on average in Q2. So if we were down, say, 4 million, 4.5 million cubic feet, due to – in Q2 from our records management business, or net, we said minus 3.8 million cubic feet, we were 4.5 million cubic feet worse than normal. But let’s say, we were down negative 3.8 million cubic feet, then we would say that based on a 20% – the 20% improvement that we’ve seen in July is worst-case scenario. You project that forward is we’re down about 3 million cubic feet a quarter, right? So that’s 12 million cubic feet on an annualized basis. Now, we don’t expect it to plateau at these levels, obviously, because we’re still only running it in financial services, less than 6% of the people that are coming to work. But with – even if we plateau at the current levels, we’re seeing is you’d be a 12 million annual drag, a negative 12 million annual drag on our records management business in terms of physical storage. And that’s before adding consumer back in. So when you net it all out is that worst case, especially with the offset that we get from consumer, is that we think that adding, our normal price of 2% to 3%, it’s manageable, where the most likely scenario is we’ll continue to see improvement, people will start – I don’t think we’re going to stay at 6% of the workforce coming to the office, it will go back up. And that’s why we said in our remarks is we expect in a post-COVID world is will be kind of flattish to slightly up in the records management business, and then consumer will drive additional growth on top of that. I don’t know if that’s helpful.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-07 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greer Aviv: Thank you, Francesca. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The user controlled slides are available on our Investor Relations website along with a link to today’s webcast and earnings materials. On today's call, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss Q1 highlights and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Barry Hytinen, our CFO will then cover financial results, our leverage and liquidity position and our expectations for the remainder of the year. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to slide 2 of the presentation. Today's earnings materials will contain forward looking statements. Most notably, the impact from COVID-19 and our expectations of how that may impact our operations and financial performance in 2020 and expectations from Project Summit. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's earnings materials, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our annual report on Form 10-K and future SEC filings for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial information, and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information. With that Bill, would you please begin?
Bill Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. First and foremost, let me start by saying, I hope you are all healthy and well and our thoughts go out to all those who have been impacted by COVID-19. I also would like to say, thank you to our employees in particular our front line mountaineers, who are on the road and in our facilities every day. As many of our services are considered essential, many of our colleagues have been ensuring our customers' needs are met as seamlessly as possible. Our mountaineers have shown selfless dedication and resilience in these challenging times. As we go through this morning's call, I will focus my remarks on a few key subjects. How we are responding and managing the business in light of COVID-19 pandemic; the new service and storage revenue opportunities we have seized, as we respond in real-time to our customers' changing needs, and the durability and strength of our core storage and data center businesses, which provide valuable recurring revenue during times such as these. First, we continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation, which as you are aware continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Our top priority is to ensure the safety and security of our people, their families and our customers. As a global business, we have been assessing the situation and implementing extensive precautionary measures since first learning about the virus in January. We have been constant. First in Asia and now globally in striving to minimize the spread of the virus and its impacts on our people, the communities we operate in and our customers. We have been serving our customers many of which are considered essential businesses in new and innovative ways as they navigate this pandemic. Now let me address the current situation, the impact on our business, and what we are doing to mitigate that impact. As an example, we are reserving storage base for critical assets and unanticipated inventory volumes, including supplies needed by health responders in food and drug retailers. We are also providing outflow storage for businesses now stockpiling inventory due to service or supply chain disruptions. In addition, we are availing our customers of our digital and AI-based services to facilitate remote working on a range of activities, including distribution of mail from corporate mailrooms to providing a digital solution allowing the processing of unemployment benefits remotely. The first quarter introduced unprecedented challenges and required us to closely examine our priorities and focus on what we could do beyond our normal course of business to remain strong, resilient and well positioned to support all of our stakeholders. Fortunately, Iron Mountain is considered an essential service in many locations and sectors where we operate. In our global records and information management business, we have been able to keep more than 96% of our facilities open at varying levels of operations all with heightened safety and cleaning procedures in place. We are seeing a need for new and more creative solutions in our digital solutions and global data center businesses. To help our customers respond to COVID-19, we are providing storage and distribution of PPE and other critical health care supplies and are offering innovative solutions around document scanning and application of artificial intelligence through our Insight platform, which can help enable our customers' home-based workforces. Whilst there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing recovery from an economic perspective, I am confident we will get through this and come out an even stronger company. We are already seeing customers seek out new services that have resulted in revenue. So whilst it's possible that customers may not use our services the same way they did historically, we are confident that we will be able to continue to generate new revenue streams. Our customer-facing teams have been closely listening to customers, engaging differently in solving problems that didn't even exist a few short months ago. We are deepening relationships with our customers and further differentiating Iron Mountain from our peers, many of which do not have our level of financial strength, breadth of digital and physical offerings and flexibility. We believe this positions Iron Mountain better for the longer term. Liquidity remains the top priority from a financial perspective, and we are operating from a strong liquidity and cash position. Barry will provide more detail on the specific actions we are taking but at a high level we are prioritizing cash generation, and we have taken action to reduce operating expenses in discretionary capital expenditures, including M&A. As of the end of the first quarter, we had more than $1.2 billion in liquidity between cash on hand and availability on our revolving credit facility. This strong balance sheet should provide us with sufficient runway to operate the business in this uncertain environment. As you would expect in a crisis such as this, our service levels have experienced significant declines in numerous geographies as many customers have instituted mandatory work from home policies or ban visits to their offices and facilities from external parties. The timing and magnitude of decline in service activity has varied by market and by product line. Whilst we are a global company with operations in over 50 markets, our exposure to countries that saw a peak in Q1, such as China, is limited, so we did not see a significant service activity decline until mid-March for the majority of our business. In our records management and secure shred businesses, which account for approximately 75% of our service revenue. Service activity has declined by 40% to 50% during the times when the respective markets have had restrictions in place as compared to the prior year. As restrictions are lifted, we expect this service activity to gradually pick back up. For instance, in our Chinese markets, we are seeing current service activity at 60% to 70% of normal levels, which has improved from only approximately 20% at the peak of the virus spread in China. While service generally contributes only about 20% of our profit, given the size of the decline as well as some of the fixed costs in the business, the impact is significant. As we have encountered this slowdown, we have made tough decisions that impact our fellow Iron Mountain colleagues. In an effort to keep our labor costs in line with levels of service activity, we have either furloughed, reduced hours or utilized other temporary reduction measures for approximately 1/3 of our global workforce. We have also managed costs by putting on hold our -- on recruiting activity in terminating most of our temporary and contract workers in our global records and information management business. Decisions that impact our employees are never taken lightly, and we have set up numerous resources to support impacted employees during this unprecedented time. This includes, but is not limited to, continue to provide benefits in sponsoring the employee portion of health care for impacted employees, helping our employees utilize their respective government programs available to those individuals unemployed or furloughed, assisting our colleagues with outplacement support and actively assisting employees through our employee funded relief fund. At the same time, our core storage business remains durable, and we continue to benefit from our deep and long-lasting customer relationships. Whilst we have seen a slowdown in the new boxes that we have been able to inbound, the majority of our storage revenue is from existing boxes that were inbounded in prior months and years, and we continue to earn revenue on that inventory. However, the impact the crisis will have on our future organic storage rental revenue growth and volume remains unknown and is dependent on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Q1, total organic storage revenue grew 3%, supported by strong benefits from revenue management. Global organic volume in Q1 was flat compared to Q4, driven primarily by growth in adjacent businesses and consumer of 8% and 5%, respectively on a sequential basis. Organic global records management volume declined approximately 600,000 cubic feet from the fourth quarter. Due to the impact of COVID 2019, we expect our volume of incoming boxes for the remaining of the year to be lower than we initially expected entering the year, but we will continue to look for ways to mitigate the slowdown. As I mentioned before, we also remain in active dialogue with our customers about leveraging existing and customized Iron Mountain solutions to help them navigate this difficult situation. I want to briefly mention a few key examples. One of our digital services that have benefited our customers during this crisis is Image on Demand. This service provides safe, contact list, digital delivery, which enhances the chain of custody security and provides a quick 24-hour turnaround online delivery. This solution enables customers to be more effective by sharing information with those who need it, whilst ensuring the information security and privacy are maintained, which is even more necessary in today's remote environment. Another example is one where we are helping one of our customers, a national health care provider, which was struggling with a surge in the need for medical supplies and supply chain challenges. This particular customer needed to distribute critical PPE to 32,000 employees at 750 sites in 36 US states and required a secure location to prep PPE kits without taking up valuable space that was being used to care for patients. In order to meet those critical needs, we provided non-records business storage and logistics support. We in-bounded in stored pallets from multiple suppliers, prepared PPE kits made up of 12 to 15 items and distributed the kits to healthcare sites. This is only one example of how we have helped many of our healthcare and medical customers during these trying times. A third relevant example is a government labor department that needed to maintain critical processes whilst enabling home-based workers to process high volumes of unemployment claim records as quickly as possible. The government agency leveraged our InSight Essentials platform, which enabled the government department to receive the scan claims via our InSight application to more than 800 unemployment examiners. We will continue to store the hard copy records for them until they need to be securely destroyed. We are currently speaking to multiple U.S. states about similar solutions to address both elevated volume and unemployment and Medicare claims during this crisis as well as the need for remote working of the teams approving the claims. As you would expect, our global data center business has also been resilient as an unprecedented number of organizations are adjusting to remote working practices, which has driven a substantial increase in traffic and the need for additional bandwidth. Moreover, the current pandemic further underscores the vital and expanding role of multi-tenant data center play in an increasingly digital economy. COVID-19 is causing companies to evaluate and accelerate their digital transformation journeys, especially as it relates to outsourcing their IT infrastructure and fortifying their remote capabilities. In fact, industry experts believe that COVID-19 is serving to fast-track trends that were already evident in the data center industry, which bodes well for this portion of our business moving forward. Looking at recent performance, our global data center business had a strong Q1 with organic revenue growth of almost 10%. We signed 6.4 megawatts of new and expansion leases and our pipeline remains robust. This leasing consisted of a 3-megawatt booking with a new logo, a leading hyperscale enterprise software provider, which also includes a contractually committed reservation for an additional 2-megawatts and our expanded campus in Phoenix. We also continued to maintain good momentum with our enterprise customers. Commercially despite an unprecedented macro backdrop, our data center team continues to receive significant engagement in RFPs for both hyperscale, corporate and government requirements. The team has quickly adjusted to the new normal of remote working and has been innovative and continue to meet our current and prospective customer needs, including hosting virtual data center tours to support demand and the increased need for capacity. We are committed to ensuring uptime and resiliency for our data center customers and we are ready with capacity and our staff to handle support, upgrades and new installations if additional bandwidth is needed whilst remote workforces are supported. One area that we continue to monitor closely is the impact on the pace of construction of our -- for our data centers currently under development. While it's not significant, we do see modest delays across many of our projects, which is also happening across the industry. Given our relatively high capacity utilization of almost 90%, should delays extend or increase in length, this could create a tight supply situation. As I said, we are keeping a close eye on this and are in regular contact with all of our vendors and construction partners. And at this moment, we do not foresee it will materially impact our anticipated bookings and delivery for this year. As we look ahead these are truly unprecedented times and the path to recovery is clouded by uncertainty and will likely be choppy. It is very difficult to predict how long this current environment will go on. And what the new normal will look like on the other side. It will undoubtedly be lasting changes to how we work and how our customers will conduct business. Given the combined effects of the pandemic and the associated financial impact on the global economy, we believe a conservative approach is warranted. As you can see from our Q1 results, Project Summit is off to a strong start. Now that our project teams are up and running, and given the speed with which we implemented Wave One, we have identified additional opportunities to accelerate strategies to streamline our business and operations. We have pulled forward a number of initiatives that were planned for waves two and three of Project Summit and expect to see those benefits materialize at a faster pace in 2020. In addition to finding new ways to work differently with our customers as we roll out Project Summit, COVID-19 has uncovered ways for us to support our customers as they adjust to remote work -- to a remote working environment. Our customers' increased need for digital delivery has allowed us to reassess our service delivery model. Our R&D and growth initiatives have well positioned us with services like Image on Demand to address customers' changing needs as they adapt to new ways of working. Leveraging these new technology capabilities, enables us to adjust our service delivery model and more efficiently utilize our fleet, labor and real estate. The most impactful changes to our service delivery model revolve around new service level agreements or SLAs. These new agreements will allow us to better align our external customer SLAs with our internal record center SLAs as well as leverage more effective use of digital delivery to serve our customers. In addition, we will also utilize third party logistics providers more extensively than we have historically for our pickups and delivery. We have proactively communicated with our customers in some of our largest markets regarding these changes and have begun implementing the SLA changes, which has resulted in some additional reduction in force across the business. This broadened scope of Project Summit should result in even higher levels of adjusted EBITDA benefit and associated charges than we initially expected. Project Summit is now expected to generate $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits exiting 2021. This represents a meaningful increase from the prior expectation of $200 million. The total program is expected to cost approximately $450 million, up from our prior expectation of $240 million. In closing, this additional benefit from Project Summit should only further propel the underlying strength of our business once we emerge from COVID -- from the COVID-19 situation. Our strong performance in Q1, together with the additional promise from an expanded Project Summit makes us confident that we will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic as an even stronger company than envisioned before. We continue to demonstrate resilience and determination and show all of our customers and communities that they can count on us in their time of need and that Iron Mountain really is iron. I want to thank all of my fellow mountaineers and their families again for their perseverance in these difficult times and I pray for their safety. I hope all of you and your loved ones are remaining safe and well. With that, I turn the call over to you Barry.
Barry Hytinen: Thanks, Bill, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. I want to echo Bill's comments. I hope you are all safe and healthy. I would like to say thank you to our Iron Mountain team. I've been truly impressed by the team's commitment, hard work and perseverance during these challenging times. As Bill noted we are confident that we will emerge from this period a stronger company driven by our durable business model and the strength of our balance sheet. I will briefly touch on our first quarter performance before discussing our approach to addressing the pandemic. In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations. And through the first nine weeks of the quarter, we were on track to exceed our targets even more substantially. Though by mid-March, our service activity began to experience declines compared to planned as more customers instituted mandatory work-from-home policies and restricted visits to their facilities. Despite this, we delivered a strong performance across our key metrics of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS, and AFFO. Revenue of $1.1 billion increased 1.4% on a reported basis and 3.2% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1% in the first quarter. This was primarily driven by organic, storage, rental revenue growth of 3%, which reflected our successful execution of revenue management. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.9% for the first quarter to $363 million despite the negative impact from lower paper prices in foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA grew almost 14%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 320 basis points year-over-year to 34%. Adjusted EPS was $0.27, up significantly from $0.17 in the first quarter 2019. AFFO grew 20% year-over-year to $231 million, driven by adjusted EBITDA growth. This represents a new quarterly high for Iron Mountain, reflecting our team's focus on driving cash generation and increasing levels of AFFO overtime. Turning to segment performance, global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 60 basis points for the quarter, reflecting volume growth in faster growing markets and revenue management, partially offset by lower year-over-year paper prices. Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 41%, represents an increase of 230 basis points driven by revenue management, benefits from Project Summit and continuous improvement initiatives. The data center business delivered organic revenue growth of 9.9%, driven by strong leasing and low churn of 50 basis points. Data centers EBITDA margin of 45.9%, represents an increase of 360 basis points consistent with our long-term goal to drive margin expansion. As a reminder as we move through the balance of the year on a reported basis, the 2019 data center results have some one-time benefits that we called out last year, which make the year-over-year comparisons less meaningful. Turning to Project Summit, as Bill mentioned, we are on track and have accelerated and expanded initiatives in certain areas in response to COVID-19. In the first quarter, we recognized $41 million of restructuring charges to implement the remainder of the first wave plus components of wave two, which contributed to the first quarter benefit of $25 million. With the increased size and scope of the program, we now expect to realize the full $375 million of benefit related to Project Summit exiting 2021 with all actions complete and the associated $450 million of charges incurred by the end of 2021. In 2020, we now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA benefits associated with Project Summit activities of $150 million compared with our prior expectation of the $80 million in restructuring charges of $240 million, up from $130 million previously. Now, I would like to provide an update on how COVID-19 is impacting our business and what actions we are taking to ensure we are well-positioned. Given the macro uncertainty, we want to be as transparent as possible to help inverters understand what we are seeing. To that end, I'm going to provide Insights that are more granular than we typically provide. But first I want to put into perspective how much of our storage revenue is generated by what is already on the shelf at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, our core storage business accounts for nearly two-thirds of our total revenue and a larger portion of our profitability. In a typical year, new volume accounts for less than 3% of our annual storage revenue. In other words, nearly all of our annual storage revenue comes from boxes that entered our facilities in prior years. As Bill mentioned, in markets where our ability to service customer facilities is limited, we have naturally seen a decline in the number of boxes that we are able to pickup. Partially as a result of this, we currently expect a net decline in cube volume in 2020, but of course that is subject to change based on the duration of the pandemic. As you would expect, the impact this has on storage revenue is much more muted than the impact it has on our service activity levels. Turning to our service business, which was about 35% of our 2019 revenue. In April, we saw activity declined approximately 40% overall, on the service business. As investors would expect, the impact has not been uniform across our service lines, so let's take a look at how this has trended across our business. I will use North America as an example, as it is both our largest market. And fairly representative of the activity levels, we have seen in other markets with similar closures and restrictions. Records management in North America, for the month of April had a 58% year-over-year reduction in new boxes in bounded and a 49% year-over-year reduction in retrievals and re-files. Data management activity in April declined less approximately 30%. A digital solution has seen a slowdown in activity compared to the first quarter, though April activity levels were flat year-over-year. In our shred business, activity declined approximately 27% in April, which has led to a corresponding decline in our paper tonnage. While we have seen an encouraging rebound in the market for paper prices recently, our average realized price in the first quarter was 44% lower than the prior year, which was a $10 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA. Consistent with the broader industry trends, we saw a sequential improvement in paper price of about 2.5% in the first quarter. And the trend has continued to improve. As investors will recall, in the past we have mentioned that a $10 per tonne change in paper price, represents an approximate $6 million EBITDA impact. Of course, this is clearly influenced by volume, so the EBITDA impact of paper price movement will change proportionately with the change in paper volume. Now, let me make a couple of comments on two of our smaller businesses. The Fine Arts industry has experienced a significant slowdown, during the pandemic. And given the nonessential nature of the business, we have temporarily closed all of our Fine Arts facilities. With a prudent view as to the intermediate term impact, we recorded $23 million non-cash impairment charge on the goodwill associated with that reporting unit. The consumer storage business through our partnership with MakeSpace, has seen an increase in demand. This led to over 5% growth in storage volume in the first quarter. And we have continued to see strong demand in April. Given the nature of the service level decline I just discussed, we have taken actions which we expect to be temporary and are in addition to the actions we had underway, with Project Summit. These actions include furloughs, reduced work hours, a pause in hiring, reductions in certain expenses like travel, and lower variable compensation. With these adjustments, we anticipate we will have removed in excess of $350 million on an annualized basis as compared to our prior plans. You will see these reductions materialize in cost of sales within our service business, as well as in our SG&A expenses. These actions are designed to help align our costs and revenues, as we navigate the uncertain environment. Therefore, we expect these costs to come back as revenue recovers. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we are confident, in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. In the first quarter, our team did a nice job driving cash cycle improvement up eight days year-on-year with benefits coming from both payables days and day's sales outstanding. I view the team's performance is particularly strong, given the COVID-19 backdrop. We continue to see the opportunity for further cash cycle improvement over the long-term. We ended the quarter with $153 million of cash and together with the availability under our revolving credit facility we had approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity. At this point in early May, our liquidity remains unchanged at that level, which we believe provides us ample runway to operate the business, in this uncertain environment. For context, this liquidity represents over three times the 2019, full year adjusted EBITDA of our service business. With our strong financial position, our Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share earlier this week to be paid in early July. As the economy recovers in 2022 and 2023 and with a sustainable dividend at this level, we would expect our payout ratio to glide toward the mid-60s to low 70s, as a percent of AFFO. As we noted in our press release, we are no longer providing guidance for 2020, in light of the unknown severity and duration of the impact of the crisis on our markets and customers. However, we don't want to help you understand how we are currently planning for the remainder of 2020. Let me start with the impact of the much stronger U.S. dollar. Based on recent FX rates, we currently expect a full year impact on our revenue of about $100 million versus last year. At the time of our last call, FX rates implied an adjusted EBITDA headwind of about $5 million. Though with a stronger dollar, current FX rates translate into a full year adjusted EBITDA headwind of $35 million versus last year. Turning to activity levels, we are expecting April to be representative of the trends we experienced for the remainder of the second quarter, which we expect to be the weakest quarter in 2020 for comparative revenue and adjusted EBITDA change. Although recent trends suggest this may prove to be conservative as more and more of our customers around the world are gradually opening back up and we are seeing other positive indicators. I will note we are maintaining flexibility to rebound quickly, if business conditions improve faster than expected. And on the other hand, if conditions worsen we have already identified additional options that can be executed quickly as needed. At this point, we anticipate delivering full year adjusted EBITDA margin flat to slightly up compared to last year, reflecting our solid first quarter performance, benefits from revenue management, Project Summit and other cost actions. This will be partially offset by our conservative posture as to service revenues and fixed cost deleverage. Given the current environment, we have also quickly taken actions to preserve capital. We reduced capital investments both for capital expenditures and M&A by a net total of $110 million relative to our original guidance for 2020. This is made up of approximately $110 million of reduced CapEx and $75 million of reduced investment in M&A and acquisitions of customer relationships. This net total also reflects an increased investment of $75 million, to support the construction of our Frankfurt data center. Additional detail can be seen in the supplemental and is highlighted on slide 14 of our presentation. We continue to expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. As we look at the market for industrial assets, we continue to see attractive valuations and our pipeline has actually increased over the last couple of months. As investors would expect, we have run multiple scenarios based on varying assumptions for revenue, margins the duration of the crisis and the speed of recovery. Included in these scenarios are some extreme stress test models, which we develop to understand the possible impact, if conditions worsened materially and persisted for an extended period of time. One of the stress test we ran was based on service activity being down about 65% year-on-year and persisting at that level through 2021. Even in that scenario, we do not foresee an issue with liquidity or leverage through 2021. I'll also note, the severity and duration of our stress tests are much more extreme than both what we have seen thus far and what current trends and macro forecasts indicate we will likely experience. Even still we would have significant cushion in terms of both liquidity and leverage. In closing, we are confident in the durability of our storage business and believe the magnitude of impact on our service business combined with the actions we have taken leave us in a strong financial position. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our second quarter earnings call. I hope everyone stays safe and healthy. And with that, operator please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Shiela McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath: Hi. Yes, good morning. That was very positive news on your guidance on the savings from Project Summit. I was just wondering, can you explain in a little bit more detail where that upside is coming from? Where you're finding those savings?
Bill Meaney: Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question. So as we got into COVID-19, as I alluded to is that our customers needed to be served a different way. And we already had a Summit teams spun up to look at our cost of sales. And what we found was, if we look specifically at SLAs for instance returning a box in 24 hours -- returning a box in 24 hours in this environment where people are working remotely wasn't going to help. So what we've done is we've actually in the major markets we've already implemented this. So this is United States, Canada, Ireland, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand. As we said, we're taking that to five business days so once a week we will pick up or deliver physical boxes. If they need something quicker then we will actually digitize it and we'll send it to them in a digital secure link through our InSight platform in Image on Demand. So we're actually giving them a better service and at the same time changing from 24 hours to five business days or once a week. You can imagine how significant that impact is on our logistics operations and allows us to really take out quite a bit of cost.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. And then also I was just wondering, if you could comment on the dividend philosophy. As your – many REITs have chosen to revisit their dividend just as a source of liquidity. And just want to understand how you're thinking about the dividend?
Bill Meaney: Well, I think we're blessed by being kind of an industry one. So we're a specialized REIT and our operations are still running strongly. We – although service has been impacted as Barry said 40% to 50% that's on 20% of our profits or 40% of our sales. So whilst it's impactful it's not a threat to our liquidity. So for our – from our standpoint, there isn't a liquidity reason that we would have to adjust our dividend. And then, as if you look at 2022, where we think we'll be looking at COVID in the back – in the rearview mirror by 2022. So we're assuming that it doesn't happen until then. Then we're actually gliding quite nicely into our original goal in our financial models as we get into the 2022 and 2023 period in terms of getting into the mid-60s to low-70s as payout as a percentage of AFFO. So we feel good about where we are. We'd rather not have COVID-19 because we would have gotten there much faster, but we feel good about the position.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Please go ahead.
Nate Crossett : Hey, good morning. Just a follow-up on Sheila's question about Summit, so how much of that $175 million benefit is coming from that SLA change, and are there any other kind of big drivers in there?
Bill Meaney: Yes. So thanks Nate for the question. So it is -- that is actually the major driver. Because if you look at our cost of service, which is a combination of labor, fleet in terms of the trucks that we put on the road and our facilities. It is -- we are one -- it is actually the largest cost as a company. And when you then say okay we're going to a five-day or once a week service cycle which allows us to marshal or consolidate volumes much more. And then for more rapid turnaround to give people digital ways of getting that back it's a major change in terms of cost of sales. We always as part of Project Summit we're going to optimize the cost of sales across those three labor trucking and facilities. But actually changing that from a 24-hour rhythm to a once a week rhythm is super impactful.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. Two questions. I didn't understand if this new rhythm for delivery to once a week from once every day was also positioned for the post-COVID environment meaning it would stay? And my second question Barry is with the stepped-up benefits from Project Summit when you reach those benefits what would be the implied EBITDA margin?
Bill Meaney: So Andrew on the first one yes this is -- and we communicated that to our customers. This is beyond COVID. And in fact, this probably is something that could have happened before, but it's easier to actually get people to change their mindset in terms of how they want to be served given the current environment. Because if you think about the 24-hour SLAs than something that was historical in the business for decades. And the way people use the information that they retrieve now is very different. And quite frankly, lots of times they'd rather have it electronically. So yes this is -- COVID was -- it allowed us to have the catalyst to have that conversation with the customers, but it's permanent going forward.
Barry Hytinen: Hi. Andrew, thanks for the question. Good morning. While we're not giving guidance for even this year's EBITDA, it's a little bit hard to get into projecting how much of that extra $175 million of benefit from Summit going forward is going to be as it relates to the numerator and denominator of EBITDA and sales. But certainly, if you thought about that $175 million incremental in sort of perpetuity and that's the way you should because it's a ongoing benefit. And put that against either our prior guidance or last year's results, for example, it is a very significant increase in the relative level of profitability and will certainly dramatically assist us in our goal of increasing margin and moving that into the very high 30s, if not potentially beyond going forward. But I think what we'll do is take it one quarter at a time this year and provide you updates as how we're doing. But I will tell you as Bill -- I'll reiterate Bill's point, we feel very good about what we've got going on with respect to Summit and the way the teams are performing. And we look forward to reporting the progress against that with you every quarter.
Andrew Steinerman: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Marlane Pereiro with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Marlane Pereiro: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one. Just to clarify, under your extreme scenarios, you anticipate not staying within both your maintenance and incurrence covenants, is that correct?
Barry Hytinen: Yes.
Marlane Pereiro: Okay. I mean, do you have -- would you be able to provide roughly an idea of how much cushion or headroom that you would have under those scenarios?
Barry Hytinen: So I mean let me frame it this way for you. As we think about leverage for this year based on the -- our current view of trends and the outline of how Bill and I spoke about it earlier, we would expect leverage to be flattish to maybe slightly up year-on-year at year-end this year. Now I will note that it is a positive development I think speaks to the team's progress and the performance we put up in the first quarter that are actually our leverage ticked down a 10th from year-end. But when we stress test the business, it probably slightly above those levels, but we feel very good about in each scenario. I don't want to give and I think you can appreciate why specific leverage points under various stress tests because there are so many models -- so many elements that go into those models. But as we said on the call, we would have sufficient cushion in both the leverage -- on all the tests that you mentioned as well as liquidity. So we feel very good about where we're positioned. And that is thanks to the incremental Summit benefits, we've pulled forward here at the incremental Summit benefits coming from the SLA changes that Bill mentioned, as well as the cost actions we took to align revenues and costs in this period here during the pandemic.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Franois – it’s from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Okay, excuse me. The next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: One more. Yes just one more question from me Andrew. Organic revenue growth in storage. Is your working assumption that it stays positive throughout the year?
Bill Meaney: Yes.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question is from Franois Mambo [ph]. The next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you. Maybe just give a little thought as to the impact on kind of both the storage and the data center business longer term given the shift in service, do you expect any impact on the storage business? And then ultimately data center as well as it relates to maybe incoming volumes things like that if you think about potential structural changes as a result of COVID-19?
Bill Meaney: On the storage side Kevin post-COVID-19 there – right now our surveys there's many customers that say that there will be no change as there – those that say that will be continuing on their current program. So no, we don't expect a major change in the trends that we're seeing on the storage. On data center, as we said is that we've seen actually continued building of our pipeline through COVID-19 and we expect that to continue to be strong on the other side. We can't tell you right now if our strong pipeline is just because of the momentum we were building into the – in the data center business as we were coming in or specific to COVID-19. But yes, there's nothing that we're hearing from customers that's saying that their demand post COVID-19 is going to be any different on the data center side than what we're seeing in terms of the positive momentum in the basis today.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-13 09:13:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Iron Mountain Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greer Aviv: Thank you, Keith. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. The user controlled slides that will be referred to in today’s prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations Web site along with a link to today’s webcast, the earnings press release, and the full supplemental financial information. On today’s call, we’ll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain’s President and CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress for our strategic plan. Barry Hytinen, our CFO, will then cover financial results and our outlook for 2020. After our prepared remarks, we’ll open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to Slide 2 of the presentation, today’s earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2020 financial and operating performance and expectations from Project Summit. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today’s press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which we expect to file later today, for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. Before we get into our discussion of the Q4 results, I want to first welcome Barry as our new CFO to the Iron Mountain family. Barry brings a successful track record of navigating transformation and effective change at various organizations. Most recently, he led efforts at HanesBrands to increase operating cash flow, reduce leverage and produce strong international growth. His insights will be very valuable as we rollout Project Summit, our transformation program to simplify our structure and create a more dynamic and agile organization. We look forward to his contributions as we enter 2020 and beyond. With that, let me start with a look back at where we have been on our journey over the past six years. Looking first at total organic revenue, in 2013 it was flat and adjusted EBITDA declined 1%. Today, we reported total organic revenue growth of approximately 1% and 2% if we hold paper prices constant. In terms of adjusted EBITDA, 2019 saw growth of 3% or nearly 5% if we apply 2019 paper prices to 2018. More broadly, progress over the past six years is visible in nearly all metrics not the least being the expansion of EBITDA margin by almost 500 basis points. This macro look back is important as it is the basis that continues to provide momentum going forward. We feel this positive momentum in sales and profitability coupled with Project Summit in a broader portfolio and service offerings to our core customers is the platform from which we expect this trend to continue. Of course, this progress just didn't happen. It is the result of the successful execution of our strategy of shifting our revenue mix to faster growing businesses, including emerging markets, data center and adjacent businesses and successfully implementing our revenue management program. We also made important progress on Project Summit, our transformation program designed to accelerate the strategy and create a more streamlined, simplified and agile organization better suited to solve our customers’ challenges. Furthermore, I am pleased to share with you that we are very much on track with our execution on Project Summit. We moved quickly with a headcount reduction we announced in order to ensure minimal disruption to the broader organization. If you recall, we announced plans to reduce the number of VP level and above positions by approximately 45%. As of the end of December, we had completed approximately 70% of the reductions. We all recognize that change is never easy. In over these last few months, our organization has shown great resilience and focus. This is a testament to our great people and the fact that a large number of mountaineers are already feeling energized by being able to more easily address and serve our customers. As it relates to the savings targets we communicated, the actions we took in the fourth quarter have resulted in $50 million of annual adjusted EBITDA benefits that will begin to flow through in Q1. We have good line of sight to the incremental 30 million of in-year benefits we expect to generate in the second half of 2020 with a number of the process and systems improvements underway. We are excited about the new ways we are embracing technology to improve the way we work so we can all show up differently and drive change. Ultimately, we expect Project Summit to expand organic revenue beyond the current growth rates, all whilst boosting adjusted EBITDA by an additional $200 million over the next two years. This is all on top of the 4% plus organic adjusted EBITDA growth we have been achieving the last few quarters. Turning to fourth quarter performance, constant currency revenue increased almost 3% over the prior year. We delivered solid adjusted EBITDA growth of 8%, adjusted EPS growth of 24% and AFFO growth of 18%, while simultaneously increasing investments to support future growth. Barry will provide more detail on the financial performance as well as our outlook for 2020. Turning to business performance, organic global records management volume remained relatively steady with a 10 basis points decline over the trailing 12-month period. To put this into perspective, globally volumes declined approximately 500,000 cubic feet on a base of nearly 700 million cubic feet driven mainly by fewer acquisitions of customer relationships. More specifically, in 2018, we acquired 3.5 million cubic feet of customer relationships which tend to be some of our highest returning investments as opposed to only 2.8 million cubic feet in 2019. We expect the impact of fewer customer acquisitions in 2019 to continue its drag on volume through the first half of 2020. However, we are confident that this is a temporary deviation and that records management volume along with incremental storage opportunities in non-box categories such as consumer and alternative storage and adjacent businesses should result in flat to positive levels of organic volume growth for the full year 2020. Now coming back to current volume trends. Apart from the dynamic I just discussed, the single biggest headwind on volume today is the rate of change of incoming boxes from our existing customers. You will recall from previous calls the average life of a box in our inventory has remained rock-steady at 15 years. Whilst the average age of a box when it is destroyed has remained steady over many years, the average age of our inventory will naturally skew during periods where the growth rate of incoming boxes is undergoing change. For example, if a vertical is experiencing a slowdown in the rate of incoming volume, then the average age of our inventory will reprise. Whilst we can’t predict when equilibrium will again be achieved, we feel in the meantime it will remain a minor impact given that our customers continue to add new boxes to storage annually, just at a lower rate than historically. To help you better understand, let’s take a look at what has become one of our slowest growing yet most stable verticals. The North American legal vertical began its digital transformation journey many years ago. This change in customer behavior is resulting in a deceleration in the rate at which existing legal customers send us new boxes every year until recently. The good news is that we have seen the growth rate stabilize to slightly positive net volume growth. We expect a similar trend across other verticals that are not as far along on their digital transformation journey. To provide further context, let’s say a legal customer stores a 100 boxes with us. 10 years ago, they would send us six new boxes a year and destroy or remove two boxes so they would be net positive four boxes or a 4% growth rate. Today, a similar customer would send us two to three new boxes and still destroy one or two boxes making them flat to net positive 1% growth rate, which is the new normal for this customer vertical remaining stable at this lower growth rate given the age profile of their inventory has stabilized. We should remind you that what I just discussed is only affecting volume from existing customers. In addition to that, we continue to focus on new customers, competitive wins, opportunities in the unvended and federal channel, and as we talked about earlier other methods of customer acquisition. We expect all these various sales channels to continue to contribute to overall organic volume growth for global RIM over time. This is what gives us confidence in the durability of the recurring revenue stream and strong cash flow generation that comes from global RIM organization, and we do not anticipate a change in the foreseeable future. As I like to say, it's the financial beast that allows us to fund growth opportunities, whilst returning cash to our shareholders. We have also made considerable progress in transforming our core RIM business to a more diversified model and are on track to achieve our targeted geographic mix, which as a reminder is 20% of revenue from faster growing markets, by the end of 2020. We ended 2019 with these markets contributing 19% to total revenue, and for comparative purposes faster growing markets represented less than 10% of revenue in 2013. Moreover, over the same period of time, we have expanded the adjusted EBITDA margin for these relatively new and faster growing markets from 20% to 30% in 2019, and we believe we can continue to expand margins as we scale our presence in these geographies and to select new markets that offer superior growth opportunities, all whilst managing our cost structure efficiently. Related, our global digital solutions business had a record year with revenue increasing 10% year-over-year. As we shared with you last quarter, our digital solutions offerings such as InSight are increasingly enabling us to approach our customers with a differentiated solution resulting in a pull through of other products and services. Just one example of this was a recent win with a large, highly regulated financial institution. This customer previously managed its physical file room storage in-house with over 600 employees across five global locations. We will assume responsibility for the management of all file storage, processing of the files and begin providing value-added services. We plan to transform the operation by consolidating locations, reorganizing workflows, adding workflow software and applying digital solutions such as RFID and artificial intelligence and machine learning through our InSight platform. When completed, this effort will not only help our customers significantly reduce costs, but it will also be the foundation for future enhanced digital products. We’re able to win the business based on our unique combination of document management and workflow expertise, combined with our digital solutions which we expect will result in close to $30 million in annual revenue for the next 10 years, making this one of the largest single deals we have signed. Turning now to our data center business. We had a good year executing 17 megawatts of new and expansion leases, including our first hyperscale deal. Whilst we are pleased with the steady commercial progress we have made leasing up our facilities ending Q4 with a stabilized utilization rate of 90%, we did see some deals in the pipeline shift from Q4 into 2020. The 17 megawatts leased in 2019 shows good progress on a base of approximately 100 megawatts at the beginning of 2019. Within our leasing for the year, we were successful in attracting over 100 new logos to our global data center platform, further diversifying our enterprise customer base and underscoring our brand strength in this dynamic industry. We continue to make good progress organically building out our global platform delivering almost 20 megawatts of capacity in key markets around the globe, including London, Amsterdam, Singapore, New Jersey, Northern Virginia and Phoenix. We are excited about our newest development in Frankfurt and currently have a strong pipeline of pre-leasing opportunities in various stages of discussion. Additionally, in Q4, we entered into an agreement for a second site in Slough which will allow us to expand our presence in the important London market by adding an incremental of 25 megawatts of capacity. Under the terms of the agreement, the landowner will build the shell after which we will finish the build out of the data center to our specifications. Our existing footprint in London, which is adjacent to this new site, is nearing stabilization and this new agreement provides capacity for larger requirements in a very desirable market with low latency network conductivity. Looking into 2020, the first half pipeline looked strong with a number of larger opportunities on the horizon. That said, these larger deals tend to be lumpy and timing is often harder to predict. Putting this all together, we would expect to be able to lease up another 15 to 20 megawatts of capacity in 2020. We feel very good about our commercial momentum and a building pipeline of demand, including hyperscale interest in a number of our markets such as Phoenix, Northern Virginia and Frankfurt. In summary, 2019 was not without its challenges in terms of consistently declining paper prices, but we ended the year in line with our expectations having a number of strong commercial wins, whilst making measurable progress on our strategic plan. We are focused on maximizing the benefits from Project Summit, not only financially but in how we operate as a team and an organization. We have a unique opportunity to translate a streamlined and more agile organization into speed to unlock further revenue opportunities through how we connect with and build additional value for our customers. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry who will walk you through Q4 performance and our outlook for 2020.
Barry Hytinen: Thank you, Bill. I am delighted to be here at such an important time in the company's evolution and I’m energized by our strategy, the engagement and strength of our team and the opportunities we have in front of us. Turning now to results. In the fourth quarter, revenue, EBITDA and AFFO were in line with our guidance ranges. We continued to expand margins as adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over last year. Additionally, AFFO increased 18% to $228 million. Revenue of $1.1 billion increased 18 million or 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter. This was driven by total organic storage rental revenue growth of 2.5% for the quarter, reflecting the volume trends Bill discussed and contributions from revenue management. Total organic service revenue declined 70 basis points in the fourth quarter year-over-year. This reflects the change in paper prices which were at record highs in the back half of 2018 but ended 2019 at record lows. Adjusting for the $13 million impact of lower paper prices, organic service revenue would have increased 2.9% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8% for the fourth quarter to $386 million, despite lower paper prices and FX headwinds with margins expanding 190 basis points year-over-year to 35.8%. For the quarter, our tax rate was in line with guidance and adjusted earnings per share was $0.31. Turning to Project Summit. As Bill mentioned, we are on track and in the fourth quarter we’ve recognized $49 million of restructuring charges to implement the first phase. For 2020, we expect to recognize approximately $130 million of additional restructuring charges, and we continue to expect Project Summit to deliver $80 million of adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 and 200 million over the next two years. We continue to expect total restructuring charges related to the program to be approximately $240 million. Now, let me take you through our fourth quarter segment performance. Global RIM delivered total organic revenue growth of 90 basis points for the quarter. Organic storage revenue increased 2.2%, reflecting volume growth in faster growing markets and revenue management. Organic service revenue declined 1%, driven by the change in paper prices. Global RIM's adjusted EBITDA margin of 42.3% represents an increase of 90 basis points driven by revenue management and continuous improvement initiatives. Turning to the data center business, we delivered strong organic revenue growth of 7.8%. We executed approximately 2 megawatts of new and expansion leasing for a total of 17 megawatts for the year. The leasing was primarily driven by enterprise and federal government customers, and churn at 1.5% remains consistent with expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 51.7%, up significantly year-on-year. Profitability was boosted by two non-recurring items. First, a $4 million contractual settlement; and second, a $2 million lease modification fee. Adjusting for those items, margin was 44.4% in the quarter, an increase of 290 basis points reflecting the increased scale and progress on integration activity. Data center development CapEx was approximately $400 million for the full year including 50 million for the Frankfurt land acquisition. In 2020, we expect development CapEx of approximately $200 million reflecting the development projects currently underway. For the full year 2019, revenue of $4.3 billion increased 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total organic revenue grew by 1.1% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.44 billion grew 2.7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.02. AFFO was $856 million and dividend per share was $2.45, representing an 82% dividend payout ratio. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Lease adjusted leverage at the end of the year was 5.7x, which was slightly down versus the third quarter. We expect leverage to remain flat to slightly down in 2020, reflecting our strong focus on profit expansion partially offset by project Summit one-time costs, lower year-over-year paper prices and foreign exchange rates. We remain committed to delevering over time, which will enable considerable strategic flexibility. As part of our ongoing capital recycling program, in the fourth quarter, we sold two portfolios which generated net proceeds of $83 million, bringing us to approximately $170 million of proceeds for the full year. We expect to generate capital recycling proceeds of approximately $100 million in 2020. As investors know, part of our strategy is to increase scale in faster growing international markets. We are pleased to report that in early January, we acquired the remaining 75% stake in OSG Records Management, the leading provider of document and data management solutions in Russia. As investors may recall, this had been a joint venture in which we previously owned 25%. We now have complete ownership of the business, which has annual revenues of more than $50 million, manages approximately 18 million cubic feet of inventory and is exhibiting strong growth. Turning to guidance, which is detailed in the supplemental for your review and highlighted on Slide 13 of our presentation. We are expecting 2020 revenue to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.52 billion to $1.57 billion, driven by organic EBITDA growth and Project Summit benefits. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.25 and AFFO to be in the range of $930 million to $960 million. This strong growth is despite continued low paper prices, additional foreign exchange headwinds and includes continued investments in digital solutions, IP infrastructure and our data center business. While we don't provide quarterly guidance, there are several items I would like to call out to consider when modeling the first quarter. First, we expect Project Summit actions taken in 2019 will be a significant addition to adjusted EBITDA throughout the year beginning in the first quarter. Naturally, we also anticipate organic EBITDA growth from our base business. I would also remind you that in the first quarter of 2019, we experienced elevated labor and other costs. Lastly, given where paper prices and the U.S. dollar are currently, we expect both will be notable headwinds in the first quarter. Our 2020 guidance implies total organic revenue is expected to be flat to up 2% as compared to prior year, including organic storage rental revenue growth of approximately 2%. Our guidance assumes paper prices and FX remain at current levels, which combined we expect to result in an adjusted EBITDA headwind of approximately $35 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Anticipated investments, which are detailed in our supplemental, will be funded by a combination of cash available from operations, capital recycling and new borrowings. We may also utilize third party capital for data center development as we have previously discussed. In closing, we expect to deliver organic growth while also realizing the benefits from Project Summit. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be commitment to our dividend, investing in growth areas through both organic investment and strategic acquisitions and reducing lease adjusted leverage over time. We look forward to sharing further progress with you on our first quarter earnings call. And with that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. Good morning. At first glance, Project Summit appears to be focused mostly on cost cuts via employee reduction. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on how any improvements in information technology might be part of the mix and any other changes or tweaks in strategy that would be focused more on revenues.
William Meaney: Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question. So let me answer the question on two levels; one, in terms of the technology aspect that you alluded to and then the other in terms of the operating rhythm in what we’re doing differently in managing and leading the company. So on the technology side is one of the biggest areas of change is going to be upgrading and applying new technology in terms of the way we track and interact with our customers. So to give you specific examples, we have four instances of sales force which is very hard to get a single view of a customer globally. The second thing is, is we have over 40 billings systems, which, again, billing is an area where we need to make sure that we’re consistently not just billing but responding to queries around billing for our customers. So that’s an area where we’re applying technology to allow our mountaineers to have better visibility of our customers, which helps them on the selling side, but also in terms of serving those customers with they have inquiries. So that’s one area in technology. The part that we’re already starting to see a big effect is in terms of how we’re leading the company. So one of the things that we talked about, but probably not as directly on the last call, is Summit isn’t just about taking cost out. It’s actually redeploying cost. So we’re actually adding cost or adding resources around people that are interacting with our customers, especially in terms of strategic account management. So to give you an example of that – and also in terms of the way we lead the company. So we now have an expanded enterprise leadership team which we met in January. And first of all, the energy in the room was noticeably different because now we have the top 40 leaders and on a regular rhythm every quarter in a room to discuss where we’re going and how to get there faster and better. But also part of that briefing was the strategic account team had the opportunity to put up a slide of one of our most mature customers that we serve globally. And the interesting thing is if you had surveyed people beforehand, they would have said that they’re customers probably 80% served if you look at a matrix of our product offering and the geography that they fit in, and they’re completely a global company virtually in every country we’re in and then some more. And the interesting thing is it was just the opposite. We’re serving about 20% to 30% of the potential of that client rather than 80%. So a combination having strategic accounts taking a global look at how we can serve that customer better, and then the energy being able to have that discussion with the top leadership of the company globally on a quarterly basis I think is going to make a real change.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, that’s helpful. And I didn’t see a sources and uses slide this quarter. I was just wondering if you could provide some insight on your outlook for sources and uses in 2020 and progress on sourcing JV capital potentially for the Frankfurt data center.
William Meaney: So, Sheila, I’ll take the JV question and then I’ll hand it over to Barry on the sources and uses. So we continue to look at entering a JV for the Frankfurt facility as we’ve spoken about in the last couple of calls. We’ve slow rolled that slightly because the pre-leasing activity on Frankfurt is very, very strong. So, obviously, we want to line that up before we finalize the negotiations. But we still expect to put Frankfurt into a joint venture. We’re quite far down the track with a couple of potential investors, so we feel good about that. But we also want to make sure that we put our best foot forward and we’re really encouraged and quite excited about the pre-releasing activity to the Frankfurt site.
Barry Hytinen: Sheila, it’s Barry and thanks for the question. It’s great to be here. I’ll just highlight a few things and I’ll note that in the slide presentation as well as the supplemental, I think you’ve got basically all of the items that you’d need. But to call out a few things, cash interest, that will naturally be below the interest expense that we guided to in light of sort of deferred financing charges and things like that go through interest. We guided to cash taxes of $70 million to $80 million. And you’ve got all of the – on Slide 13, all of the various items for recurring CapEx and non-real estate is about 150 million, and you can see the customer inducements, et cetera. We are assuming $100 million of capital recycling. You know that we did more than that in 2019. I’d call out that Summit, as we mentioned, is about $130 million of expected use in the year. And then you’ve got our data center development and base acquisitions, et cetera. So I think you’ll find that if you work through the schedule, there’s a considerable amount of cash available for discretionary and we feel good about where we are at this point.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And right now we have a question from Nate Crossett with Berenberg.
Nate Crossett: Hi. Good morning, guys. The volume decline in the quarter, I appreciate some of the color you gave, but can you give us some more detail on the declines? Like what’s the breakout of declines for North America versus international? It sounded like you said at the end of 2020, you’re expecting volumes to be flat to up. Did I hear that correctly?
William Meaney: Good morning, Nate. So, first of all, we expect volumes to be flat to up for the year, including consumer and other alternative to storage, such as art, for instance. But yes, you’ve heard that correctly. You’re right to also assume that North American is where the negative volume is. The rest of the world; Europe is basically flat, slight positive. It changes from quarter-to-quarter, but think of Europe as flat. And then other international is kind of mid-single digit positive, right, because those were the faster growing emerging markets. So just to come back to it to put it in context, first of all we’re talking about 0.5 million cubic feet of negative decline in the year, over 700 million cubic feet. And if you look at that, that’s more than explained by just the slowdown in the number of customer acquisitions that we did during '19 as compared to 2018. And at that level, that’s totally in our control. In other words, we normally do about 3 million cubic feet. We did less than that in 2019. We did more than that – a little bit more than that in 2018. And the difference between those two more than accounts for the 0.5 million cubic feet down in 2019, so just put that into context. In addition to that is we continue – we source volume in three different buckets besides volume coming in from existing accounts. We source it from customers that are completely unvended, not just the federal government but even some of our most mature – I mentioned one of our most mature customers, they, believe it or not, some places where they still do records management in-house and I actually talked about the file rooms that we’re taking over for this customer which is the largest single customer we ever signed, $30 million a year. We signed that contract because we’re actually providing them a full wraparound solution, but we’re taking over all their volume in their record rooms which historically weren’t in our facilities, right, and this is a customer that we served for many, many years. So there’s the unvended bucket. The second bucket – and those are our most highest return. The second and third buckets are either competitive takeaways or these customer acquisitions I talked about, which has historically trended around 3 million cubic feet plus or minus on a given year. Those actually have similar returns. And one case is we’re paying paramount fees and sales commissions. In the other case, we’re paying someone that wants to get out of the business or is getting out of business completely and we take over those customer contracts. So if we look at those three vectors, we continue to see that there’s a lot of growth. The last thing I would say just to emphasize is that I talked about the legal vertical. The thing that’s driving the negative trend is not that all of a sudden people aren’t sending us anything. Virtually every customer is continuing to send us new boxes every year. The thing that is driving the slight drag on volume is a secondary effect of slowing down rates as they go through this transformation. So, the legal vertical I gave you for a number of years when it was going through that deceleration was in negative net volume territory because each year the rate of incoming boxes was changing, so the average age of their inventory was ticking up, and so you were getting more boxes destroyed during that period of time. As it’s now stabilized at the new normal at this lower rate, it’s actually stabilized the slightly net positive cube. So we see the similar trend happening with some of the other verticals that may be a little bit further behind the legal vertical on digital transformation. But it is important to note that the legal vertical, which is virtually almost our slowest growing vertical in North America, is actually slightly net positive in terms of cube growth.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.
Eric Luebchow: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Curious, Bill, on kind of your international footprint. I think you’re earlier in the revenue management initiatives in those international markets. So I’m curious what type of impact you’ve seen as you’ve rolled that out and if there’s been any impact on customer retention or volume growth as you rolled that out more broadly across your portfolio?
William Meaney: It’s a good question, Eric, and you’re right. We are in the earlier innings on those markets and those are the faster growing markets. So the growth that we’re getting from other international when you see storage revenue growth is mainly from volume growth and only a little bit of revenue management. So far we don’t see any difference in trends in those markets than we did, say, in Western Europe when we rolled out or North America before that in terms of elasticity. But it does take longer for that effect to show up just because some of those contracts are on three years, some of them even on five-year contracts. Of course, some are annual. So what we find is we’re I guess 18 to 25 months into the rolling revenue management out globally and you’ll see that just like it did in Western Europe, it will take I would say another year, year and a half before you start seeing the full effects of that.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Michael Cho: Hi. Good morning. This is Michael Cho on for Andrew. I just had – my first question is a follow-up on Project Summit. I realize there’s always a number of moving pieces and, Bill, I think you gave an example of up selling [indiscernible]. But if we think about the impact from Project Summit, what’s the EBITDA margin goal for having that as a result of the Project Summit?
William Meaney: Mike, I’ll let Barry talk about it. We have talked about it as you said briefly on the last call, but Barry can give you some more color on that.
Barry Hytinen: Okay. Hi, Michael. Thank you for the question. If you look at where we are from an adjusted EBITDA margin today and what’s embedded in the guidance and then if you play that out over the next couple of years, as you know, Project Summit is going to generate 200 million or more of EBITDA benefit and you work through both improvements in our base EBITDA as well as Summit, together with a little bit of revenue growth, I think you’d find that over the course of the project as we’re exiting it, probably going to find the EBITDA margin into the high-30s and we feel very good about where we are trending. I’d say Summit is well underway. The fourth quarter actions were taken and completed very successfully. And we have very good line of sight on the in-year benefits here this year. Thank you for the question.
William Meaney: Operator, can we go to the next question please?
Operator: Yes. [Operator Instructions]. And the next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I’d like to delve a little bit deeper into your physical storage volume trends. Your global volumes grew 90 bps year-over-year in 4Q, but this did decelerate from nearly 2% growth in early 2019. This is rather a large move for a relatively stable business and you talked about legal and the declining rate of change with new boxes. Can you maybe elaborate on what’s causing the increase in the second derivative of change and perhaps what needs to happen for volume growth to stabilize or improve, which is what you’re assuming for 2020?
William Meaney: Hi, George. So let me first start with your observation on Q1. So the reason why I also said that we expect the trend that we saw in Q4 to continue in the first half of 2020 is the Q1 was also a high quarter where we actually did customer acquisitions. So the trends that you’re kind of calling out is virtually 100% covered by the change in customer acquisitions, not even the second derivative. Now in terms of the overall change in terms of volumes in North America that we see, as I said, is that when legal was going through its downward march in growth rate as they were transforming or adding more digital processes to their workflows is we did see similar trends that we’ll see, for instance, in financial services today. Financial services is still one of our higher growing or incoming boxes for financial services, but it’s just at a lower rate than we did previously. So first of all, because we’re talking about the thing that’s impacting our net volume for some of these verticals is rates have changed just by its very kind of mathematical nature. These are muted effects, so they’re secondary effects. And the thing I can’t predict – the thing I would predict is I think we’re going to be in this territory, but if you think about it over a year kind of 7 million to 8 million negative cube growth just on pure RIM and mainly focused in North America until we get through this transformation. And as I said, when we look at legal, we’ve gotten through that and legal is actually slightly positive in terms of net cube growth whilst it goes through it. But the thing that’s hard to predict is how fast people digitally transform and what growth rate they stabilize to.
Operator: We do have a question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Adam Parrington: Hi. This is Adam on for Shlomo. Could you talk a little bit more about what’s weighing on the organic revenue growth guidance for 2020? Just the 0% to 2% organic, just talk about it a little bit more?
William Meaney: Yes. Thanks, Adam. It’s linked to the other question, which was how is the revenue management rolling out into emerging markets? So it is a broader range – and I understand where you’re coming out with the question – is that right now we’re still seeing most of the growth internationally, which is becoming a bigger percentage of the whole of the company, is coming from volume rather than pricing. So we want to get more visibility in terms of how quickly some of the pricing changes we’re making in international before we could guide higher.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Sheila McGrath with Evercore.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. Bill, historically you’ve mentioned that you’ve had some wins with the U.S. government with that specialized account focus group. But you’ve also mentioned it takes a while to get the inventory from them. Just wondering if you’ve seen any progress in terms of them implementing the awards to Iron Mountain?
William Meaney: Yes, it’s a great question, Sheila. So I would answer it in two different ways. I think the contract you talk about, we had a very large blanket contract with one of the large departments and it’s still exactly – we still have the frustration that you’re alluding to. Actually we’ve had more wins on the service side, because it has been easier for them to give us business on the service side than it is on the storage, and that’s partly because of the relationships with National Archives. So one thing that we do know both from the National Archives and government leaders is that we do expect over time for that to start coming free, because National Archives has publicly announced that there is only a window, it’s over the next few months or years, where they’re going to continue to accept volume from government agency. So eventually that will come loose, but that one has been slower. On the other side, we had a win I think it was about a year and a half ago where we – I think it will be two years this summer. We had one win with a large government agency where they were exiting their own warehouse and we moved that. I think we won in the summer and we had it all – we had 400,000 cubic feet roughly moved by November into our facility near Joint Base Andrews. So when they decide to move, we can onboard it quite quickly. But the contract that you’re talking about, that large government contract, we find that we’re getting more success on the services, the digital services side right now than the storage, because of the stickiness with their relationship with NARA.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Nate Crossett with Berenberg.
Nate Crossett: There has certainly been a lot of chatter in the DC space in terms of M&A. We’ve heard that some of the smaller private players are having a harder time of late. And I’m just wondering if that could maybe create some opportunities for you to acquire, what’s your current appetite for kind of accelerating the DC build out?
William Meaney: Good question, Nate. I think you asked it last time as well. So I guess I should expect it. But our stance is still the same is that we feel really good about the acquisitions that we did, if you think about the IO that was really building the platform and Credit Suisse have allowed us to start building out our international management team as well as the EvoSwitch in Europe. I think where we stand right now is that we like development – development still has the highest returns. Now that being said, we do when we go into a market, for instance, I think I may have used – referenced this before. We looked at Frankfurt, we looked at either doing an acquisition or buying land. In this case, we bought a piece of land that was already permitted. And for us the better opportunity was buying the piece of land and building it out. But we do look, when we go into these markets, what I would call brownfield where we – there may be a small player in that market that we want to be in, but it has significant amount of expansion capacity on their land or within their shell. So we do continue and that was what drove us to the EvoSwitch. Amsterdam was another market where we looked at, buy a brownfield opportunity for a greenfield, and in that case it was better to do a brownfield. So we’ll continue to look at it that way, but we don’t feel like we need to go out and buy something to bulk up for the sake of bulking up. We feel we’ve grown a lot and we’re in a pretty good position in terms of being recognized. And I would say that we see most things that are up for grabs in the markets that we’re present in.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Just a follow-up question on volume trends that you’re seeing. You called out legal and financial services as being in transition. Can you discuss how volume trends may be evolving in some of your other larger verticals?
William Meaney: Well, I think legal has kind of – George, has kind of gone through the transition. That’s why it’s now gone back to kind of net positive, flat to net positive. We don’t give it to you vertical by vertical, but I’ll just give you a kind of a flavor. Health sciences is actually one that we’re still seeing significant increase in growth. But most of our verticals are going through different degrees and this is mainly North America, a little bit in Western Europe are going through. We see digital transformation taking hold. So they’re further behind on legal, but they are getting impacted right now. But if you wrap it all up together, George, it’s still – as I say, it’s the second derivative – sorry to be a little bit mathematical, it’s the second derivative effect. That’s why we think it’s very much bounded in this kind of 7 million to 8 million negative cubic feet on a 700 million cubic foot base. And I’d say right now, it's really focused mostly in North America and Western Europe is kind of flat, moves up and down a little bit.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question also is a follow-up from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Michael Cho: [Technical Difficulty] but in the 2020 organic revenue guidance, what’s the data center revenue growth and the margins that are implied in the 2020 guide?
Barry Hytinen: Data center continues to contribute nicely for organic growth, and obviously that can vary some depending upon the level of hyperscale deals that we execute and commence in the year. But you’d be thinking something in the, call it, 10% kind of range on a constant basis.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-31 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Iron Mountain Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv. Please go ahead.
Greer Aviv: Thank you, Chuck. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The user controlled slides that will be referred today, in today’s prepared remarks, are available on our Investor Relations website along with a link to today’s webcast, the earnings press release, and the full supplemental financial information. On today’s call, we’ll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain’s President and CEO, who will discuss third quarter performance and Project Summit, the transformation program announced this morning. Stuart Brown, our CFO, will then cover additional financial results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared remarks, we’ll open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to Slide 2 of the presentation, today’s earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2019 financial and operating performance and expectations from Project Summit. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today’s press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. On today’s call, I would like to cover two main topics. First, we delivered another solid quarter showing adjusted EBITDA growth of 5% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter on a constant currency basis, further demonstrating the strong and consistent organic growth we are building in the businesses as well as continued progression in the year. Second, we announced Project Summit, which is a transformation program we are commencing in November that will leave us with a simpler and more dynamic management structure, better supporting our future. Before we get into our discussion of the Q3 results, I will first address Project Summit. At a high level, this transformation program focuses on three key areas. First, we will simplify our global structure by combining our core Records and Information Management or RIM operations under one global leader, whilst also eliminating unnecessary work in rebalancing resources. Second, by simplifying our global organization, we will streamline our support structure, whereby we will condense the number of layers and reporting levels from our current average of 6 levels, down to 4 levels. This will create a more dynamic agile organization. And third, we will more efficiently leverage our global and regional customer-facing resources across RIM product lines, creating better alignment between new digital solutions in our core business, resulting in an enhanced customer experience. All in all, Project Summit is expected to deliver $200 million in annual run rate adjusted EBITDA benefits with all actions expected to be complete by the end of 2021. We expect to incur total restructuring cost to achieve these benefits of $240 million. Of the total benefit, $50 million will be implemented during the course of November and December, with a restructuring cost of approximately $60 million being recognized in the fourth quarter. Whilst there will be little to no benefit from this first phase of Summit in our 2019 results, benefits are expected to start flowing through in the first quarter of 2020 on top of our normal growth. Before diving into more detail on Summit, let me provide some context. Over the course of Iron Mountain’s nearly 7 decade history, we have developed unmatched trust and scale. We have built the global player in the Records and Information Management business today, storing nearly 700 million cubic feet of records with extremely deep customer relationships, including 95% of the Fortune 1000. This global growth, which has in large part been executed through acquisitions, has resulted in certain complexities in areas such as business processes, IT systems, lines of accountability, decision making and other redundancies across our organization. To be able to compete most effectively in any industry today, you must be flexible, have efficient lines of communication and be able to react quickly to evolving customer needs. We have heard from our customers that we need to be more integrated in our approach to solving their problems. This means, tearing down our internal silos, equipping our teams with the necessary tools to better meet customer needs across our business offering, and continue to standardize, streamline and simplify our systems and processes. But in order to take fully – and to fully take advantage of this significant opportunity, we also need to better align our resources and capabilities, so we have a more simplified and efficient operating model. Whilst the underlying health of the business is solid as demonstrated by the 3% organic storage revenue growth year-on-year, we believe Summit will allow us to continue that momentum, so we can capitalize on future opportunities faster and more efficiently. We expect Summit to enable us to better execute on our strategy, so we can continue to grow both in revenue and profit, whilst also generating more free cash flow. This improvement in financial results will come from furthering our position as the global leader in the Records and Information Management industry, as well as continued investment to build further scale in data centers and create digital solutions for our customers whilst reducing leverage. Moreover, through Summit, we are simplifying our global structure with a view to provide an environment where people can work in a dynamic workplace, all whilst identifying and vigorously pursuing the highest potential opportunities to serve our customers. In doing so, we will undertake steps to improve the efficiency of our operations and increase the pace at which we are able to affect change. And our operations and cost structure will be better positioned allowing us to sharpen our focus on higher growth areas that can provide solid returns to our investors and enable us to enhance the strong customer relationships we already have across the enterprise. As I mentioned earlier, key catalyst for this change, both from a customer service viewpoint as well as an operating efficiency standpoint is to place all of RIM under a single global leader. To this end, we are proud to announce that Ernie Cloutier, our International EVP and General Manager, will now lead global RIM operations in our new structure. As we mentioned in this morning’s announcement, Patrick Keddy will be retiring as EVP and General Manager of North America and Western Europe. Patrick is a seasoned executive who had led developed markets for several years and he will take on a consultative role, assisting Ernie, during the transition into his new role and provide support to Iron Mountain through the beginning of 2021. We are extremely grateful to both Patrick and Ernie for their leadership and efforts to position the RIM business for sustained success under a united structure. In addition to Ernie taking on this expanded role, he will be supported by Greg McIntosh, who is now charged with establishing and leading our commercial operations along with Strategic Accounts. Strategic Accounts is a relatively new area for Iron Mountain as we upgrade our ability to grow and service some of our highest potential customers. In addition to Greg, Ernie will be supported by Deirdre Evens, who leads the North American RIM business. Additionally, Deirdre will report to me, leading the continued development of consumer storage, which includes our partnership with MakeSpace. In terms of transforming the company to be more agile and dynamic to the benefit of our employees and customers, we will condense the number of layers and reporting levels which is expected to reduce the number of VP level and above positions by approximately 45%, including the impact of these reductions, approximately 75% of which will be actioned during the next two months. The program is expected to reduce our total managerial and administrative workforce by 700 positions over the next two years. It should be noted that Summit is causing us to say goodbye to many friends and colleagues. We are now in a situation that we need far fewer senior leaders if we are to serve our customers in a more responsive way. We are committed to providing the right support to these employees that it negatively impacted including appropriate severance and outplacement support. Iron Mountain is a close-knit community. So it is never easy to part ways with team members, but the needs of our business continue to evolve and this realignment will prove to be value-enhancing for our organization, our team, our customers and shareholders over the long term. Turning now to Q3 performance, we delivered constant currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.7% and 5% year-over-year respectively. This has resulted in a 120 basis points expansion of our adjusted EBITDA margin to 35.4%, reflecting the benefits of revenue management and lower overhead costs, as well as the positive impact from the efficiency initiatives we began work on earlier this year, offsetting lower recycled paper prices. Turning to business performance, Global Records Management volume trends continue to be positive with net organic volume increasing by more than 3 million cubic feet or 40 basis points over the last 12 months. This was driven by modest improvement in new sales, whilst destructions were in line with Q2 levels. In developed markets, volume declined organically by about 3.5 million cubic feet or 70 basis points. More specifically, declines in North America RIM volume are in line with prior quarter, down 1.2%, while Western Europe grew organic volume by 1.5%. Other International net organic volume increased by 6.6 million cubic feet or 3.6%, a modest acceleration from previous quarters as new sales growth was strong and destructions moderated. We remain encouraged by the resilience and durability of our core records management business, and believe unifying the RIM organization under 1 global structure will result in unlocking incremental opportunity in the core business and beyond. We will better align resources across the RIM organization to both to bolster our customer experience, globalized processes and extend our reach beyond our core records management offering. For example, the North American RIM team has been successful and leveraging our assets to grow non-core storage opportunities in the area such as consumer, library services and other channel relationships contributing more than 3 million cubic feet year-to-date to our storage portfolio. We continue to make good progress in penetrating some of the historically unvended segments of the North American markets including the federal government. Our federal team had its best quarter yet in Q3 with revenue growing double-digits year-over-year with solid wins across multiple product lines, including core storage, shred, IGDS or Information Governance and Digital Solutions and data center. This is a great example of the sell all culture we are driving toward. Our IGDS business is showing strong year-over-year growth with a focus on increasing the contribution from recurring revenues, we have seen good success with our digital solutions increasingly enabling the pull-through of other revenue opportunities across multiple product lines allowing us to engage with customers on a different level, when addressing a more comprehensive solution that meets their evolving business needs. Just 1 example of this was a recent $4 million win, including scanning some 250,000 cubic feet of documents, where we combined our insight platform with our digitization capabilities. It was this unique offering, which compelled this engineering customer to choose us. Finally, we continue to be very optimistic about our growth trajectory across our Global Data Center platform. Q3 was a busy quarter with new turnkey data center capacity brought online in key markets around the world, including Phoenix, London, Amsterdam and Singapore. In addition to the hyperscale lease we signed in the critical Northern Virginia market in early Q3, we are encouraged by the retail-focused enterprise demand we see as evidenced by a growing pipeline. Looking at data center leasing activity in Q3 more specifically, we signed 8 megawatts of new and expansion leases, primarily driven by the lease in Northern Virginia. Excluding that we signed 2 megawatts driven entirely by enterprise demand with nearly 75% of the kilowatts attributable to new logos to the Iron Mountain data center platform. Through the end of the third quarter, we have leased a total of 15.2 megawatts and continue to expect to achieve the high-end of our 2019 target of 15 to 20 megawatts. As we have shared with you on previous quarters, a clear differentiator for Iron Mountain in the data center space is our strong brand recognition and the power of our ability to leverage customer relationships of our traditional sales force. In summary, Q3 was a solid quarter, which highlights the continued durability and stability of the core Records and Information Management business whilst demonstrating the growth opportunities available to us in faster growing markets and businesses. Once implemented, Project Summit will simplify our day-to-day operations and enable us to move faster and ease our ability to capture growth opportunities and execute on our stated strategic priorities through building a stronger, more nimble organization that enhances our service to customers and generate solid returns for all stakeholders. I should add also today, we announced a 1.2% increase in our dividend to $2.47 per share on an annual basis. We are continuing to grow our dividend albeit at a more modest space given the solid pipeline of data center investment opportunities we see ahead in 2020. Durable provide more financial details for Q3 as well as the impact of Project Summit, both near and longer term. Stuart?
Stuart Brown: Thank you, Bill. We have a lot to cover today, so let me jump in. Before reviewing business performance and outlook, I want to give you some perspective on Project Summit in the impact on our longer-term financial framework, a framework showing our plan to generate more cash flow to fund our growth investments and an increasing dividend over the long term. The benefits of the structural transformation we announced this morning are expected to expand over the next several years, helping to fund significant opportunities to create value by investing in both our physical storage and data center businesses. Looking out, we expect our storage business to continue to exhibit as consistent and durable characteristics, and see strong demand for data center capacity resulting in low-single-digit annual organic storage rental revenue growth. Service revenue, while more lumpy in nature, should remain flattish as declining core services are offset by new customer solutions. The revenue growth and ongoing continues improvement initiatives should grow adjusted EBITDA organically and consistently around 4% or approximately $60 million per year. Project Summit will continue to help drive higher AFFO, generating increasingly more cash flow. As Bill noted, with Project Summit we intend to invest in higher growth opportunities including data center development and continued scaling of our international operations, while simplifying how we operate. Our strategic priorities and capital allocation plans remain unchanged, as we continue to leverage our global leadership and records management and information governance as well as our enterprise relationships. We will continue to be very disciplined in our capital allocation decisions, balancing investments that create value for shareholders, while providing more solutions for our 225,000 customers. The framework demonstrates our commitment to fund the majority of our growth to robust free cash flow, and in turn, reduced leverage. As we grow AFFO, we plan to operate with lease adjusted leverage in the range of 4.5 to 5 times [EBITDAR] [ph], depending upon where we are in the cycle and with our dividend payout ratio more in line with data center and other faster growing REITs. Now turning to quarterly results, we generated revenues of nearly $1.1 billion in Q3. Total reported revenue grew 10 basis points or 1.7% excluding the impact of the stronger dollar. As you can see on Slide 8, our total storage rental revenue increased 4% on a constant currency basis in Q3 driven by organic storage rental revenue growth of 3%, reflecting results from revenue management and global volume growth. More specifically, developed markets organic storage revenue was 2.3% for the quarter, reflecting continuing contributions from revenue management and volumes trends that were largely consistent with Q2. In the Other International segment, we continue to achieve healthy organic storage revenue growth of 4.5%. In data center, organic storage revenue growth was 4.1% in Q3, a little lower than previous quarters with churn of 2.4% matching the expectations we had messaged last quarter. Our Adjacent Businesses were also performing well, growing organic storage revenue by 5.2% in the quarter. Total service revenue declined 2.1% in constant currencies with organic service revenue down 3% in the quarter compared to growth of 7.1% a year ago. This change mainly reflects the swing in paper prices, which were at record highs in the back half of last year and are currently less than half of those levels. If we exclude the $13.8 million impact of lower year-over-year paper prices, organic service revenue would have increased 20 basis points in Q3, which is below recent trends due mainly to lower project revenue in our international markets. We now expect annual organic service revenue to decline approximately 1.5%, while annual storage organic growth is expected to generate – to increase about 2.5% resulting in total organic revenue growth around 1%. Remember that generating gross margins of 74%, storage remains the key driver of our profitability. As you can also see on Slide 8, third quarter SG&A declined about $16 million from a year ago, reflecting cost management actions as well as lower variable compensation compared to a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA increased $13 million year-over-year or 3.7% to $376 million, despite the lower paper prices. Excluding the impact of currency changes, adjusted EBITDA increased $18 million or 5%. AFFO in the third quarter was $225 million compared to $227 million a year ago. This decrease is primarily attributable to $9 million of higher maintenance in non-real estate growth investments, including the completion of the number of recent shredding plant upgrades to reduce transportation costs to improve capacity. Slide 10 details adjusted EBITDA margin performance by business segment. In total, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 120 basis points year-over-year to 35.4%. Turning to Slide 11, you can see that our lease adjusted leverage ratio of 5.8 times remains in line with other REITs and was flat to Q2. We expect leverage to remain flattish through the end of the year held back by lower paper prices and exchange rates as well as the cost of implementing Project Summit ahead of our benefits flowing next year. Importantly, we opened the crossover debt market in early September, raising $1 billion of 10-year bonds at 4.875%, an offering that was 3 times oversubscribed. We use the proceeds to pay down borrowers under our credit facility, which in turn extend our average maturity to 6 years. Further, we have good line of sight to exceeding $100 million in net capital recycling proceeds from the sale of real estate this year after having closed on 2 purchase options in Northern California and selling a portfolio of Midwest properties in Q3. Turning to 2019 guidance on Slide 12, while our core storage and records management business has been strong, this year has had some headwinds that we are not fully anticipated when we laid out the guidance. This includes, of course, paper prices which will impact adjusted EBITDA by almost $30 million for the full year. To a lesser degree, we experienced lower growth in project revenue – project service revenue than we’d expected. But we have successfully implemented a number of cost savings initiatives. They’ve only partially offset these challenges. We expect Q4 EBITDA to be up slightly from our performance in Q3 with little to no benefit from Project Summit in the quarter. This is below previous growth expectations due partly to lower service results in developed markets. As a result, we now expect fully year adjusted EBITDA to be near the low-end of our previous guidance or a range between $1.43 billion to $1.45 billion, with this change flowing through to AFFO and adjusted EPS. This implies year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of constant currencies of 2% to 3%. While we will provide formal 2020 guidance in February with our Q4 earnings call, given the size and impact of Project Summit, we want to provide some important components to help in modeling. At a high-level, we expect organic adjusted EBITDA growth to continue to be about 4% year-over-year or approximately $60 million. Incremental to our normal organic adjusted EBITDA growth, we should see $50 million of benefit from Project Summit actions taken in 2019 and $30 million of in-year benefit from Summit actions taken in 2020, which will be second half weighted. In addition, current paper prices and exchange rates indicate $25 million to $30 million of headwinds, relative to results anticipated for full year 2019. Putting this altogether, we would expect to see a year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million. Also, we plan to treat the cost to implement Project Summit as restructuring, which will be excluded from our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. To conclude, the transformation program that we announced today is expected to yield significant benefits as we simplify how we do business, bringing value to shareholders and to our customers. Implementing this program provides a clear path to delivery of our strategic priorities, including generating cash flow to fund our growth, while helping ensure that Iron Mountain’s position as the trusted guardian of its customers’ most precious assets is protected for years to come. We look forward to sharing our progress with you on our fourth quarter earnings call early next year. With that, Chuck, I’ll turn it back over to you to open up the line for Q&A. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Nate Crossett of Berenberg. Please go ahead.
Nate Crossett: Hi, good morning. I’m curious to get your sense of how the $200 million in annual cost saves will be allocated, I guess, just in terms of how you’re viewing growth projects like data centers versus, say, deleveraging, what’s the kind of breakout of uses?
William Meaney: So first of all, the Project Summit is totally driven in terms of reorganizing the company, so that we’re simpler to work with from the customer standpoint and it allows our mountaineers to work more efficiently and quicker with less obstacles internally. So it’s really about reorganizing the way we do things rather than businesses that we’re conducting. So they’re quite separate in that sense. So if you think about overall in terms of the project is as we said that $50 million will be actioned over the next 2 months. And that’s – the big change in the feeling of the company will be in terms of the way when we change kind of the leadership hierarchy of the company. So that first $50 million, 40 – is about really getting us 75% of the way in terms of getting what I would call the top of the house structured in a way that’s going to make us more efficient to both interact with our customers as well as to action things internally on their behalf, because that’s really looking at 45% of the changes or 45% reduction in our VPs and above. So that’s really the first $50 million of change. And then what we talked about was the $30 million of in-year benefit on top of that $50 million for the 2020 guidance. That equates to about $70 million worth of action of the $200 million program. So by the end of 2020 will be up to around $120 million of cost improvement of a $200 million program. So that’s how the things sequence. But they’re very separate from our investment data center. Data center, we continue to see strong growth as both Stuart and I highlighted. If you think about it this year is we’re up about 10% since the beginning of the year in terms of leased capacity. And if you normalize for the churn that we talked about on the last quarter call, which was known when we bought IO; then we’re up about – we’re up in mid-teens in terms of year-on-year growth in terms of leases that we’ve actioned and brought into online. And then if you look going forward in 2020 is we gave guidance that would be 15 to 20 megawatts that we would book this year. And at the end of the third quarter we’re up a little over 15 megawatts. So again, quite – yeah, consistent with our guidance that we continue to expect to be able to grow data center between 15% and 20% a year. So – but it’s very separate from Project Summit. Project Summit is really about reorganizing it, so we can be more effective.
Nate Crossett: Okay, that’s helpful. And then, just maybe on the DCs since you talked about it a lot. There is obviously been a lot of chatter in this space in terms of M&A. Just curious to get your thoughts on whether you guys continue to look at opportunities from time to time and what your appetite is to maybe accelerate that DC build-out as a percent of the overall EBITDA of the company, because it is a higher growth area.
William Meaney: I agree with you, Nate. But also a lot of these acquisitions are pretty pricy. And fundamentally, when we’re looking at capital allocation, it can’t be just about bulking up. It needs to be a good allocation of capital and it needs to be accretive on both earnings or an EPS as well as an AFFO per share basis. So we’re pretty disciplined on looking at that. We feel really good about the acquisitions we done today. Obviously, the IO being the larger of the ones, which was about – it’s much about building a platform. But I think now we really have been able to build up the platform and attract the talent that we need to lead that. So I don’t anticipate us doing any major acquisitions. I mean, there are what I would call smaller acquisitions like what we did with EvoSwitch in Amsterdam, which is close to – those types of acquisitions, when you pencil them out, are close to or near the same cost as it would be cost to build, right? So if there is an acquisition where we think the economics would give us similar cost as a cost of building it, allow us to action quicker into the market, we will do that. But I don’t see us doing any major acquisitions just to bulk up.
Nate Crossett: Okay. And then, maybe just one last quick one, organic storage growth 3%, looks like that’s the highest it’s been since 1Q 2018. Just wanted to get your sense of how sustainable that 3% market is going forward. How far along are you in that revenue management initiative you put in place and how much runway do you have on that piece of it going forward?
William Meaney: Yeah, we feel – it’s a great question. We feel really good about it. And exactly, really the two drivers, one is the revenue management now is rolled out globally. So we see that there is still more runway in terms of continuing to get more out of revenue management across all the business lines. And I would say it’s rolled out globally for RIM. But we’re also expanding it to some of our other business lines in terms of the non-RIM. But – and some of those are storage and some of those aren’t. I think the other aspect in terms of volume, we’re continuing to encourage in terms of the growth that we see in the international markets, and even in North American market, where we see slightly negative headwinds in terms of volume what I would call in the traditional records management business. I think I highlighted in my remarks that year to date, Deirdre and her team have actually brought in about $3 million of non-traditional storage, which has similar returns as our box business. So we see also some of the new areas of storage. So net-net, you put it altogether, is we feel really comfortable to be kind of maintaining in this kind of zip-code for our organic storage revenue growth.
Nate Crossett: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question will come from Sheila McGrath of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath: Yes, good morning. Bill, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more description on Project Summit. After the Recall acquisition, you did have significant cost savings initiative. How does this project compare to that? And did you engage outside consultants for the analysis?
William Meaney: Okay. It’s a great question. So the – so let me kind of – let me back up in terms of – I think your question, the other question is the catalyst for this. Is that the – first of all, when we looked at – at some point, we knew that we wanted to bring our records management under a single business unit globally. And I think the timing first of all is right for that. So that was the primary catalyst. And you say, well, why is the timing right to bring records management together into a single business unit now? For those of you who’ve been following this story for a while, six or seven years ago, when we started on this journey, is emerging markets were only 10% of our sales as a company and it’s now approaching 20%. We originally set our goal to get that to be 15%. Now, it’s approaching 20%. And it was important to have a separate, a near separate leadership if we wanted to be able to make sure that we are allocating capital in a thoughtful way in getting the returns we needed as we built out that footprint. And both is through one-off acquisitions as well as the Recall acquisition. We feel really good. First of all, we doubled the size of our footprint effectively in those markets. So we feel really good in terms of what Marc Duale and now Ernie and his team has been able to do. That’s point one. So now we actually do have the scale internationally, so having the, what I would call, separate and siloed focus to execute that, is for sure what’s necessary. On top of that is we talked about earlier this year and we talked again today, we have been hearing more and more from our customers, both internal and external. We have – our employees are telling us how difficult it is to get things done internally sometimes on behalf of a customer. But also, customers are looking for us to show up with integrated solutions seamlessly across the geographies they operate in. And we started setting up a strategic accounts organization under Greg McIntosh earlier this year. We put those two together. We knew that we had to simplify, first of all, the organization by bringing Ernie’s organization together with Patrick’s onto a single leadership. The timing being quite good, because Patrick’s intention to retire in early 2021. We thought now was the time to bring those 2 organizations together. When we brought those 2 organizations together, there is a bunch of costs that just naturally flows out, because you don’t have 2 support functions, supporting 2 different business units. You now have 1 support function serving a single business unit. And we wanted to make sure we took that opportunity to look through the organization completely, especially service part of the organization on how we could actually operate the business differently. So starting in January, if we are taking out 45% of the vice presidents and above as a result of this amalgamation and change, which was the catalyst to relook at the organization. This gave us an opportunity and we think, in terms, of the people who can be around the executive leadership team now. It will be a bigger and more inclusive group, but it will be smaller than the numbers we have before. So our ability to actually communicate strategic intent into action request on customers will be much faster, because we can get more – we can get the right people around a single table to execute. So that’s really the thing that’s behind it. And then, the good news from a shareholder standpoint, when you do that kind of organizational efficiency, there’s a lot of benefits that flow through. The last thing, I’ll talk about Summit, and I’ll come to your question about advisers is the backend of the project of Summit is – the front end is really actioning, so by the end of this year, 75% of that reduction of the management cadre will basically be in place. As we go through the program over the next 2 years, is that we will start building new systems capabilities that allow to support that organization, which a lot of it is IT-led. Last thing to your question on advisers. Actually, this is something that we’ve been working on for a number of months, but when we got closer to the execution phase, we did bring advisers in the middle of August to make sure that we were actually executing in a way that was consistent and with speed. So we did bring in advisers and towards the tail end of the project.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. Great. A couple of quick follow-ups. You mentioned this was customer driven, do you have to make any meaningful changes to your sales approach? And maybe for Stuart, where will we see these cost savings? Is it more in corporate G&A? Or will it be in segment margins?
William Meaney: Okay. Sheila, I’ll take the sales, and then, Stuart can follow on your follow-on question. On the sales, you’re absolutely, right. I mean, one of the things that we hear from the customer. Our customers and this is probably consisting a lot of industry, our customers are asking much more for solution oriented approach to them rather than selling them a product and a product might be digitization, a product might be box storage. And I highlighted the case where we won a project with an engineering company in Europe, where they had 250,000 cubic feet. It started out that they just wanted us to remove the 250,000 cubic feet and may be digitize some of them. And it turned out to be a project, where we really understood what they wanted. We realize the combination of the insight platform to create – to automate the creation of more metadata as we actually digitize their boxes. And then they said, well actually we want everything digitized and the boxes will be destroyed. So it’s an unvended opportunity. These boxes were stored in their facility. But by actually having a different sales team that’s actually engaging them with a broad set of solutions, we were able to actually do more for our customers. And as a result, win a bigger and better project from an Iron Mountain standpoint. So you’re absolutely right, is that this allows us to actually collapse a lot of sales enablement – well, sales operations, sales enablement, strategic accounts and marketing will all be under Greg McIntosh, who actually is in Ernie’s organization, so that we’re delivering that our RIM customers. So there is a big part about it, in terms, of changing the way we go to market.
Stuart Brown: And Sheila, in terms of how the benefits will flow through, the actions that we are taking here in the fourth quarter, we talked about mostly people action so that will flow mostly through the SG&A line is where you’ll see that. And then the actions we’ve talked about that we’re taking in 2020 are more around cost of sales are continued to be some SG&A improvement as well. And so you’ll see that flow through more in the back half of 2020. And then when you think about sort of the flow through from there, right, in terms of the impact on our customers, as we rollout things like mobile customer tools, so we get fewer touch points between our customers ordering boxes or services or shredding or things like that, we’re going to enable more mobile tools for our customers that have been asking for. And actually simplify some of our billing as well that through the number of M&A acquisitions and things like that that we’ve done. We’ve got a number of manual processes around billings, which frustrates internally creates a lot of inefficiencies as well for our customers, it’s not always easy for them. So those will flow through in various lines and that will continue to flow through within the later years.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Curious, Stuart, you mentioned that your net lease adjusted leverage were kind of remain flat throughout the year, but ultimately you wanted to get down to 4.5, 5 times range. So maybe you could kind of help us give a bridge for how you will get there and kind of the mix of EBITDA growth and/or capital recycling and data center development CapEx? And how long you think it will kind of take to hit that target?
Stuart Brown: Yeah. Thanks, Eric. I think, if you look at what we talked about in our opening remarks, really, our aim is to grow our free cash flow to cover the majority investments, which were obviously, generating good returns on acquisitions and data center. And so our capital – deployment capital allocation strategy in terms of where we’re putting capital to work and the amounts are not really changing, there’s no change in strategy there. From a leverage standpoint, our leverage is in line with other REITs today. And actually from a rating agency standpoint, the credit markets already treat as if we’re rated higher than we are. You can see that in the results from the bond offering. And so to get to 4.5 to 5 times, is really about optimizing our flexibility over time. So if you look at sort of where the deleveraging should come from, right, with organic EBITDA growth of around 4% and the Project Summit benefits, it will grow to $200 million, those in of themselves will reduce our leverage, right, that will allow us to reduce our leverage. We continue to see this strong demand in data center and other projects, and look at even what our pipeline is today, we’ve actually taken our data center capital for the fourth quarter up a little bit to get some projects started, particularly in Amsterdam and Virginia, where we see strong demand. And so we expect that our leverage will be flat to slightly down in 2020 as the benefits from Project Summit start to flow through from there. And so going back to sort of longer term financial framework at 4.5 to 5.5, obviously, optimizing between 4.5 and 5.
Eric Luebchow: Great. And then, just a follow-up on the data center, if you look at your pipeline, how should we think about the mix of kind of the more hyperscale business, which I know has slightly thinner returns and your kind of traditional retail enterprise business. And maybe – if you could maybe provide an update on the kind of Frankfurt JV process and how you’re thinking about that?
William Meaney: Okay. It’s a good question, Eric. I think that the – if you look at this quarter, for instance, where it’s obviously biased towards the hyperscale win that we had in July. I think that kind of smooths out over time. I think that I would say that we anticipate, we look at size that lend themselves to hyperscale like Northern Virginia, I think, when it’s fully built out, it would be around 50-50 or even 60-40 hyperscale just in terms of a large facility like that, which will still give us blended cash-on-cash returns of the 11% to 12%. So for us, it’s all about speed of fill in terms of the mix between hyperscale and what we call, normal enterprise. The one thing I would add though is the other aspect about hyperscale, which is not lost on us, is we do have some hyperscale customers that have similar returns as enterprise, when they actually deploy an edge-type deployment, so smaller deployment. So when you say hyperscale is a customer for us, but there’s even segment within a hyperscale, they have some requirements that look more like enterprise, when they call edge, and then they have other ones, which are pure large deployment. So – but we still net-net we think about half of our business will be hyperscale, and we’ll end up with the kind of 11%, 12% cash-on-cash returns. In terms of Frankfurt is we continue to have positive discussions about putting that into a joint venture. It’s not absolutely critical that we do that, but we would like to do that, because it just allows us to stretch our balance sheet or expand faster into other areas. And as you can with the pipeline of 15 megawatts already sold or booked year-to-date, we’re doing – we’re pretty pleased with that, and we don’t want to slow that down.
Eric Luebchow: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead.
Andrew Wittmann: Hi, great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, the dividend increase here wasn’t the 4% you guys talked about kind of mentioned that you’re going to use these proceeds that you’d otherwise putting the dividend towards deploying into the data centers. Is this the right way to think about the long-term growth rate of the dividend, considering that you’re probably going to continue to have data center investments?
William Meaney: Yeah. It’s a great question, Andy. I think that – and you’re right to kind of cite, because if you think about what we’ve – it’s about 3 or 4 megawatts that to be by growing the dividend at this rate, allows us – the exchange is about 3 or 4 megawatts. And given the pipeline we have right now is we think, it definitely gives our shareholders better return, if we’re actually taking that cash and given the 11% to 12% cash-on-cash returns and buying 3 or 4 – building out 3 or 4 megawatts based on the demand pipeline you can see that we’re – our occupancy is pretty tight on the data center side. So then if you say on a go-forward basis, we’ll continue to make those kind of trade-offs, it’s probably not lost on anyone, as most of our data center peers are – have a payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO kind of in the mid-60s to low-70s. So my guess is that’s probably where we’re going to settle out just given the demand that we see on data center.
Andrew Wittmann: Got it. That’s helpful. I also wanted to ask about the margins in your core North American RIM business. They were noted as down year-over-year, I think, the revenue management techniques were pretty clearly a benefit to the quarter. I was just wondering, how you can reconcile good revenue management likely in North America with the margin performance. What are the things happened there, Stuart, in the quarter that fed into that?
Stuart Brown: No. The main reason is obviously the paper price, right. So if you adjust for paper price margins are actually up year-over-year for the quarter. So that’s really the main driver.
Andrew Wittmann: Okay. And then could you just – because there’s always a lot of moving pieces in your numbers, Stuart, could you just help us understand the change in the midpoint of the guidance, what were the key factors there? I mean, you kind of listed some of them paper, obviously, was one of them as well, but if there’s some other things. Just maybe here, can you just help bridge the new guide to the old guide?
Stuart Brown: Yeah. I mean, the old guide, the midpoint of [$1,460 million] [ph]. We now lowered that to the midpoint of [$1,440 million] [ph], which is actually the lower end of our previous range. The key drivers are, again, even just since the last earnings call, paper prices are down, so down about $15 per ton. So that in and of itself is about $4 million or $5 million of lower paper price, actually the stronger dollar has also impacted us, so that’s right, given where the dollar is right now, again, that can vary a little bit. That’s about $5 million. The other piece of it is the North America records management. The core services are down, part of it is due to actually lower destructions, which is good for volume. But that’s obviously a headwind or negative for the revenue that comes from the destructions. But we also have lower service gross profit in the UK and France, and a little bit of higher bad debt. Those things have been partly offset with the lower global SG&A due to the cost actions that we’ve taken and lower incentive comps, not where we wanted to be, but I think sort of clear path to where we are in this range.
Andrew Wittmann: Okay. So just on that the – Slide 13 kind of calls out paper separately. So your guidance is actually a little bit lower than the nominal number you just gave there. The biggest chunk that you just reconciled there was paper price for, I think, you said $15 million or so. So all those other factors, how does that go in?
Stuart Brown: Yeah. There are different periods is what you’ve got, right. So one of them is, I’m reconciling guidance in 2019 versus what’s changed from 3 months ago. On Slide 13, if you look at where spot paper price is today compared to the average of 2019 is down about $35 per ton. And then we talked about on the last call that every $10 change in price per ton is about $6 million that get you into the low $20 million impact. Paper prices stayed where they are today compared to the average paper price that we’ve recognized in 2019.
Andrew Wittmann: Okay. Cool. Yeah, that period is the key thing on the year-over-year guide, that’s the difference here. Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I’d like to dive a little bit deeper into the pricing and volume growth trends you’re seeing in the storage business. Once you strip up the benefits of your very strong data center growth from storage performance. Can you discuss broadly any changes that you may be seeing with pricing and volume growth?
William Meaney: Yeah. Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. Actually, if you strip out data center, we said it was 3% growth total, including data centers, it’s like 2.8%, 2.9%. So the data center is a bigger impact on EBITDA growth, and it does on the revenue growth. As we’ve said before, it’s about 7% of our sales as a company, it does contribute about 1/3, close to – coming up to 30%, 35% of our consolidated EBITDA growth, but on the sales side it’s actually fairly minimal.
George Tong: Got it. That’s helpful. I’d like to go back to your strategy around managing a financial leverage, I know, Project Summit is definitely going to help with leverage. But then structurally longer term, what are your strategies around changing or improving the translation of growth CapEx into generating EBITDA, such that your EBITDA growth accelerates and can support increases in gross leverage over time.
Stuart Brown: Yeah. And then – I appreciate you asking that question, because you get sort of a little bit of multiplying effect, right. You’ll get increasing EBITDA from the results of Project Summit on top of the normal organic EBITDA growth. And so if you look today from a capital allocation standpoint, we’re generating plus or minus $100 million of cash flow after dividend to fund growth, well, that will grow over time, right. So free cash flow after Summit will end, we talked about $200 million or so of EBITDA take a little bit of tax of that. So our free cash flow available for growth investment themselves will allow us to borrow less. So you get higher EBITDA, you won’t – we won’t be borrowing as much to fund growth. And then you get the benefit of the growth itself. So as we’re putting capital to work, the EBITDA that comes off of the acquisitions as well as comes off the data center growth will then accelerate the deleveraging. So while, you won’t see as much deleveraging in 2020, because of the cost of Summit, as the flywheel starts going, you’ll continue to see leverage come down. And again, long term, our – we’ll live within a range of 4.5% to 5.5% – 4.5 to 5 times [EBITDAR] [ph] depending upon where we are in the cycle. 4.5 to 5 times, it’s really optimally where we want to be will provide the most flexibility over time.
George Tong: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Adam Parrington: Hi, this is Adam on for Shlomo. Could you talk more about the trends in record management volumes this quarter, particularly in the developed markets with volumes declining again sequentially?
William Meaney: Yeah. Actually – thanks for the question. I think, actually we were pretty pleased, actually moderated the decline in North America. And you have to remember, this is on a very large base. But if you see this quarter, it’s actually an improvement over the most recent trend. Partly it’s driven by what Stuart said, on the other side it’s a drag on service revenue, because we’ve seen less destructions. So we’re not picking up the revenue there. And then – so it is slightly negative as you pointed out. And where we’re picking up some volume is on the new storage areas which we picked up about 3 million cubic feet. But overall, actually the trend is that, it’s moderating. We don’t see a major difference. The thing that’s driving the trends in North America, you could look at North America which is slightly negative and you can look at – in Western Europe, actually which is slightly positive in terms of volume trends, very similar economic statuses, both very mature markets. But I think it really comes down to the rate of change of incoming volume and whether or not boxes are aging out or the average age of our inventory is increasing. So we continue to see a fairly steady trend, but not much of an improvement, not much of a degradation and this quarter is actually a slight improvement.
Adam Parrington: Got it, okay. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from Andrew Steinerman of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Cho: Hi, good morning. This is Michael Cho for Andrew. Just a couple of quick ones on the data center segment, just given the healthy activity, really healthy leasing activity, maybe can you just remind us what the revenue growth goals of the data segment are? And the second part of that is, maybe you could provide some pricing commentary as well in terms of the environment you’re seeing? Thanks.
William Meaney: Okay. Well, so first of all, we maintain consistency. If you look at it right now, as I said, going back to this year, we’re up about 10% since the beginning of the year in terms of leased up activity. And if you correct for the churn, the customer churn that we called out at the last quarter, which we knew when we bought IO, we’re actually up mid-teens year-to-date if you correct for that. I think that if you look at our bookings this year of 15 out of 20 megawatts target, and so – I think we’re on track to hit the upper-end of that original range. That again is going to put us in kind of the mid-teens to 20%, so like 15% to 20%, set us up for 15% to 20% growth next year. So we continue to see the growth of our data center business to be mid-teens. In terms of pricing, I would say that the pricing is fairly consistent. In other words that if we’re looking at enterprise, we’re still getting the cash on cash returns anywhere from 12% to 15% depending on the size of the deployment for an enterprise customer. And on the hyperscale deployments, we’re continuing to get 8% to 9% cash-on-cash returns, blended 11% to 12% over an entire site or campus. So the pricing is staying pretty stable from what we see and we’re very pleased with those kinds of returns.
Michael Cho: Thanks. And then if I can just squeeze one more on the dividend. I know you – Bill, you mentioned the dividend comment along with AFFO. So I just want to make sure I got it right. So are you saying that the dividend growth will moderate towards the range of AFFO that you mentioned and you can track AFFO from there?
William Meaney: Yeah, I think most likely. I think the thing that drives it obviously is capital allocation, right? So we do want to continue to grow our dividend at what we think is a reasonable rate to get back to our shareholders. But then, if you kind of look at – if you look at this year, as I say, the difference between what – we’re growing the dividend this year versus last year, equates to being able to build out another 3 or 4 megawatts for our data center as an example. So if you think – if you’re trying to think of a proxy on that, if you look at data center peers, they are all kind of in the mid-60s to low 70s as a payout as a percentage of AFFO. And my guess is we’re in kind of the high 70s right now. So my guess is we’ll probably settle out somewhere in that range with our data center peers, given the pipeline of opportunities we see.
Michael Cho: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Marlane Pereiro of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Marlane Pereiro: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one, can you discuss MakeSpace in terms of how much accounted for growth in consumer and other cubic feet in storage volumes this year?
William Meaney: Yeah, all right. Thanks. It’s a couple of million. I called out we had about 3 million of what I would call other or of new kind of storage. And it’s about 2.5 million. We expect the full year to be about 2.5 million to 3 million cubic feet coming from MakeSpace. So a small but growing and we’re really pleased with the partnership we have with MakeSpace.
Marlane Pereiro: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thanks. Hey, you folks are pretty clear. But I wonder – pretty sizeable restructuring, when did you kind of make the decision that it’s kind of had to happen? And then, the design aspect of it, how long did it take to kind of, number one, determine you’re going to do it and then put the structure in place to announce it?
William Meaney: Well, that making the decision to do it was literally this week to how should it be, because you don’t do these things lightly. We want to make sure we had full discussions with our Board before we tackle them. But obviously, we’ve been looking at this for months. So, I mean, that you can imagine that we’ve been looking at this for pretty much the – since the winter time.
Kevin McVeigh: And then, I guess, from a cost perspective, is it primarily on the storage side, where it’s going to sit or the service? And then, ultimately, is there any way to think about – the 2020 framework on the EBITDA was helpful – does it assume there is no revenue slippage or any thoughts on what the cash flow impact, like if you were to think about free cash flow in 2020, Stuart, is there a way to maybe just help us frame that? I know it’s not formal guidance, but it seems like the EBITDA is pretty – there is a range there. But just any thoughts on what that cash flow would like, and again, is there any kind of revenue impact from these actions or is it kind of revenue continues on trend?
William Meaney: Kevin, just to be clear on this is what we’re doing – this is probably atypical that what you hear in a lot of restructure. This is not about the coalface or the people who are actually delivering and picking things up with our customers every day nor about the people at the frontline for the most part. This is really about changing the way we manage and lead the company from the top. That’s why if you – coming back to it is 45% of people from Vice President and above are impacted, which is difficult for all of us. But the main benefit of this, so coming to your revenue question, is a year from now – it’s painful going through these kinds of realignments and organizational change, so you can imagine that people are feeling that, because it’s a close knit company. But a year from now, we’re going to have a much nimbler and agile leadership structure, which allows us to action quicker on behalf of our customers in giving them integrated solutions, which quite frankly none of our competitors in specific business lines can do, because most of our competitors are either doing storage or scanning. None of them are doing storage, scanning, artificial intelligence have the data center and have a relationship with them that’s – with the customers that are global. So this is really about speed. So what we see, we haven’t built any of that into our guidance, but we’re doing this, because we expect to have a positive impact on the revenue side. But we haven’t built that in, because we’re much more saying, we’ll tell you when we see it, we don’t promise something that we don’t see. So, right now, what we laid out with the program by actually changing the way we lead and operate the company, we’ve outlined the cost impact that naturally flows from them. But this is all about speed and ease, both for our internal mountaineers, make their job easier, as well as our customers to interact with us.
Kevin McVeigh: Understood.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greer Aviv: Thank you, Kate. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The user controlled slides that we will be referring to in today’s prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations website along with a link to today’s webcast, the earnings press release, and the full supplemental financial information. On today’s call, we’ll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain’s President and CEO, who will discuss second quarter performance and progress towards our strategic plans; followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover additional financial results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared remarks, we’ll open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to Slide 2 of the presentation, today’s earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2019 financial and operating performance.  All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today’s press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements.  In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and a reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
Bill Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking time to join us. We’re very pleased with the continued durable revenue growth across our businesses and the improved operational execution in line with our previous outlook. Some of the highlights of the quarter included total organic storage revenue growth of 2.4% and total storage growth of 4.6%. We continue to make good progress in identifying new storage opportunity whilst organic volume increased 40 basis points in our global records management business.  Good momentum driving improved operational efficiencies across the organization and data centers delivering strong organic growth. We have leased 7 megawatts through the second quarter in line with our full year expectation of 15 megawatts to 20 megawatts. Moreover, Q3 is getting off to a strong start with a 6-megawatt lease signed in Northern Virginia.  Starting with a review of our financial and operating performance in the quarter, total revenue increased 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $1.1 billion. This growth was driven an almost 5% increase in storage revenue, partly offset by lower service revenue growth reflecting lower recycled paper pricing, which I will touch on in a few minutes.  The cost issues we experienced in Q1 were fully corrected during the quarter, which is evident in the sequential adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 210 basis points above the high end of the 150 basis points to 200 basis point margin expansion we guided to in our last call despite some onetime cost. As you saw from our press release this morning, we have tightened our guidance range is given we are halfway through the year and there has been less variability in FX rates than we expected when we provided our initial guidance.  We now expect revenue to increase between 2% and 4% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA to increase between 2% and 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis remaining within our initial guidance ranges. We remain focused on successfully executing in the second half despite some external headwinds with a strong finish to the year anticipated setting us up to enter 2020 in a good position.  Turning back to Q2 performance, we also continued to see good organic growth with the organic storage revenue growth up 2.4% for the second quarter and 2.2% year-to-date, reflecting continued strong growth from data center, the other international segment, adjacent businesses in stable performance in Western Europe and North America. Revenue management particularly in North America is trending ahead of our expectations. Total organic service revenue growth was negative 2% for the quarter and roughly flat year-to-date due to lower recycled paper prices. We expect this to remain a headwind for our service business for the remainder of 2019 as we cycle over record pricing a year ago. It should be noted, however, the headwinds from paper price on a year-over-year basis amount to $20 million to $30 million on what was last year $115 million of revenue from the sale of paper. The actions we have taken are more than enough for us to manage this headwind and maintain our profit goals, given it is less than 1% of the revenue in the overall business, albeit a little less than 2% of the profit. Turning to business performance, we continued to see good growth in the alternative storage categories including adjacent businesses, consumer and other. Volume and consumer and other grew more than 760,000 cubic feet sequentially or 31% in part reflecting strong demand for high touch consumer storage during the peak season. And our records management business, we organically added roughly 3 million cubic feet of net record storage volume worldwide over the past 12 months representing 40 basis points of growth and increasing trend driven by both new sales and lower destruction.  More specifically, Developed Markets organic volume declined by about 60 basis points. A slight improvement from Q1 organic volume growth in the other international segments continues to grow at a faster clip, increasing 3.4% driven by an increase in new sales of 9.7% and modestly lower destructions. We encouraged by the consistent performance of our global records management business and continued to see a solid commercial pipeline. Shifting to our Digital Solutions business, we continue to support our customer’s evolving needs by providing a number of Digital Solutions. To this point, our Information Governance and Digital Solution team or IGDS at a very good Q2 with a number of wins in a healthy pipeline that is expected to deliver strong double-digit revenue growth this year. In conjunction with our Federal team, IGDS was awarded a nearly $13 million contract from General Dynamics Information Technology under a sub agreement Iron Mountain will perform work is part of a digital transformation initiative for a government agency. As it relates to our Iron Mountain insight platform and partnership with Google, we continue to see good momentum for this innovative solution, which is powered by existing Iron Mountain products and services adding even more value to our portfolio of Digital Solutions. In Q2, we signed a deal with a large financial services customer for a comprehensive solution to manage the document workflow process of auto loans. In addition to providing this customer with scanning and secure storage of loan documents, insight extracts and validates the data, verifies the signatures and certifies authenticity of the loans and associated collateral. We decided this quarter to evaluate alternatives with regards to the infrastructure supporting select offerings within our Iron Cloud portfolio.  We generally approach our Digital Solutions based on a hybrid model in terms of what we developed internally and who we can partner with for best-in-class technology solutions for the right cost. This evaluation has led us to a shift in partnership approach for some of our Iron Cloud solution such as object store and resulting in a onetime drag on our reported results this quarter, which Stuart will discuss in a moment. Finally, as mentioned earlier, our data center business continues to build leasing momentum in conjunction with the build out of our platform. As mentioned earlier in early July, we signed a 6-megawatt deployment in Northern Virginia, which is expected to commence later this year. I want to congratulate the data center team for the successful execution of this deal. It’s a great accomplishment and should add significant value to our campus ecosystem.  Looking at data center leasing activity in Q2, we signed 3 megawatts of new and expansion leases, primarily driven by enterprise demand. Year-to-date, including the new lease in Northern Virginia just mentioned, we have leased 13 megawatts with clear line of sight to achieving the high end of our annual target of 15 megawatts to 20 megawatts.  Furthermore, we continue to demonstrate the strengths of our customer relationships when winning retail sales focused on large enterprises building private cloud infrastructure. Consistent with the first quarter activity approximately 40% of our leasing pipeline, we’ve generated by our non-data center sales team. Cross selling opportunities like this will continue to help us realize synergies as the data center business growth. As it relates to development activity, we are on track to deliver the first phase of new capacity at our Phoenix campus expansion with the grand opening scheduled for August 15, and an additional 5 megawatts of capacity scheduled to be delivered across the three international markets in Q3. In summary, Q2 was a strong quarter that demonstrates the durability of Iron Mountain with continued improvement in global storage organic revenue and volume growth, enabling us to continue to invest in new growth areas to support our long-term business model. We are encouraged by the momentum we see in our data center business and we’ll continue to expand that platform and drive further synergies across the business. Whilst our digital services and solutions are helping our customers solve new business challenges.  With that, I will turn the call over to Stuart.
Stuart Brown: Thank you, Bill. Thank you all for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2019 results. As Bill mentioned, we are pleased with our second quarter performance with revenue of nearly $1.1 billion. Total revenues increased 0.6% or 3.1% excluding the impact of the stronger dollar. Our storage rental revenue increased 4.6% on a constant currency basis, driven in part by growth in our data center, emerging markets and adjacent businesses. Total service revenue increased 0.7% in constant currencies.  As you can see on Slide 6, total organic storage rental revenue growth accelerated to 2.4% in Q2, reflecting results from revenue management and global volume growth. More specifically, Developed Markets organic storage revenue growth came in at 1.3% for the quarter, reflecting continuing contributions from revenue management and volume trends. In the other international segment, we achieved continued healthy organic storage revenue growth of 3.7%. Year-to-date, organic storage revenue growth was 2.2% and with the strong commercial pipeline and a modest decrease in records destructions, we now expect full year organic storage revenue growth of 2.2% to 2.8%. This underscores the consistency and durability of our high margin storage business and strength of our commercial teams. Organic service revenue, however, declined 2% in the second quarter as we cycle over growth of 7.6% a year ago. This mainly reflects swing in paper prices, which were record highs last year and currently about 20% below the five-year average, driven in parts by two large paper mills in North America that were offline in Q2 and lower pulp prices leading to an oversupply of paper for recycling. Assuming prices stay at these low levels, the year-over-year impact to revenue and adjusted EBITDA is about $25 million and assumed in our current outlook. Given this and lower destruction service revenue, we now expect service organic revenue growth to be flat to down 50 basis points for the full year and therefore total organic revenue growth to be in a range of 1.3% to 2% in 2019. While reported service revenue was lower than we anticipated, remember that many of our services provide important support to our core storage business, promote deeper customer relationships and are increasingly designed to solve our customer’s problems, managing and analyzing both physical and digital assets. Our digital services are growing nicely and we continue to evaluate test and grow them to enhance our business and grow new lines of revenue over time. Lastly, as it relates to organic revenue growth, we generate some of our best returns on capital from acquisitions of customer relationships, which are not dissimilar from paying commissions to our sales teams, as we pay a local competitor for their customer contracts and integrate with our existing business. We include the revenue as well as the investment is part of our organic growth, given their similarity to competitive takeaways, but the timing can be a bit lumpy. To give perspective, over the past three years, annual investments have range from $30 million to $70 million. These low risk, high returns sales enabled acquisitions are part of our core growth strategy, particularly in developed markets. Year-to-date, they have contributed about 60 basis points of the 2.2% total storage organic growth. Now turning to our data center business, we are very pleased with the leasing progress momentum. The data center business delivered organic revenue growth around 6% in Q2 and signed 3.2 megawatts of new and expansion leases. Churn during the quarter was a more normal 1%, but this will vary over time given the size of our data center portfolio and we’ll tick up again in Q3. Additionally, we agreed with one of our customers to shorten leases in two of our markets in exchange for higher rental income during the remainder of their modified term. While this will generate elevated turn in the first quarter of 2020, this was a strong positive for our data center business has a freed up capacity in Northern Virginia, enabling us to win the 6 megawatt deployment that Bill mentioned. As you can see on Slide 7, SG&A excluding significant acquisition costs grew about $8 million from a year ago. This was primarily caused by higher compensation expense related in part to the consolidation of acquisitions and our investment in a global operations support team, as well as by increased technology expense. Our adjusted EBITDA declined $17 million year-over-year or 5% to $351 million. Excluding the impact of currency changes, adjusted EBITDA declined $9 million or 2.6%. As Bill mentioned, there were some – there were several one-time items that impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $10 million in the quarter. These included a $4 million charge related to our Iron Cloud infrastructure and the remainder for charges related to building damage that occurred during the quarter. AFFO in the second quarter was $210 million compared to $228 million a year ago. This decreased reflects a stronger dollar and other changes impacting adjusted EBITDA, as well as somewhat higher interest expense in quarterly cash taxes, partly offset by lower non-real estate investments. Slide 8 details the adjusted EBITDA margin performance by business segment. The North America RIM margin resumed year-over-year expansion in the quarter, as we addressed the cost issues experienced in Q1. Excluding the change in lease accounting, which reduced margins in the segment by about 20 basis points compared to a year ago, EBITDA margin in this segment expanded 30 basis points. The North America data management margin declines continued to be driven by lower volumes as well as product mix. Revenue management is helping to offset some of the declines that support healthy margins. In Western Europe, Q2 margins contracted 20 basis points, reflecting higher temporary facility costs and professional fees for process improvements. Some of our recent acquisitions of customer relationships in the region are operating at lower margins until we can fully synergize. Other international margins were up 30 basis points in the quarter, despite the 75 basis points impact from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, reflecting the increased scale of geographies and continuous improvement initiatives. In the global data center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins were 44.4% in the second quarter, partly reflecting the acquisition of EvoSwitch and the Netherlands last May, which operates at lower average margins and the impact in churn that occurred in Phoenix in Q1. As you have seen in our release, we have had an immaterial restatement of our prior period results. During the quarter, we received a notification of assessment from tax and custom authorities in the Netherlands related to value-added taxes on specific business to business customs activity performed by our Bonded business, which we acquired in 2017 and as part of entertainment services. As a result, we have made an immaterial restatement of our prior period financial statements, which can be seen in our 10-Q to be filed later today. Turning to Slide 9, you can see that our lease adjusted leverage ratio remains in line with other REITs and was flat with Q1. We are on track with our plans to generate $100 million plus of capital recycling proceeds this year from the sale of real estate and we continued to explore options for a JV investment partner for our Frankfurt data center development. And therefore, we expect our leverage ratio decline in the second half of the year. Also, we’re encouraged by the recent momentum we have seen by the REIT coverage teams at the rating agencies. As we mentioned in Q1, S&P revised our outlook from stable to negative. Similarly, Moody’s revised our outlook to stable in June based on the strength and diversification of our business model with strong cash flows from our core storage business. Our balance sheet remains solid and we continue to invest and grow the business at very attractive returns with low risk. Turning to outlook, you can find the details and underlying assumptions in the appendix or in our Q2 supplemental. Given these – given the investments we’ve made to improve efficiencies coupled with the operational improvements implemented in Q2 and additional initiatives underway, adjusted EBITDA should continue to ramp through the back half of the year. AFFO and adjusted EPS guidance ranges have been adjusted to reflect the revised EBITDA guidance and for earnings per share also for higher depreciation. We’ve also updated our expectations around capital allocation. Given the increase in leasing activity, we now expect data center investments to be about $50 million higher this year, but have reduced our outlook for business acquisitions due to the expected timing of closings of deals in the pipeline. As a result, we are reducing our expectation for M&A capital to $100 million from $150 million previously. In summary, Q2 reflects healthy and consistent revenue performance from our storage business. While the paper price environment is a headwind, we’ve been taking steps to mitigate its impact on profitability. Our actions to improve margin performance from Q1 levels are evidenced in our results and we are confident in further improvement in the back half. We are excited about the leasing activity and pipeline in our data center business and remain pleased with solid and sustainable revenue growth our teams are delivering. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Bill for some additional comments before opening up the line for Q&A.
Bill Meaney: Thanks, Stuart. Before we open up the call to your questions, I wanted to take a step back from the quarterly detail and remind you of our long-term business model, which is supported by the durability in the records management business. As an organization, one of the biggest assets we have is extremely deep and long lasting customer relationships, which provide us access to 950 of the Fortune 1000. These relationships are built on decades of trust and delivering best in class storage and value-added services. Having earned the reputation of trusted guardian of our customers assets allows us to leverage these relationships to identify cross-selling opportunities in drive significant synergies across our growing data center platform, particularly amongst enterprise customers, establishing a private cloud infrastructure and looking for a secure and reliable IT environment. A second key asset that Iron Mountain possesses is our durable developed markets record management business, which is allowed and will continue to allow us to consistently deliver strong organic cash flow, enabling us to fund future data center growth, scale our emerging markets footprint and invest in innovative solutions to meet our customer’s needs. These two significant assets underpin our overall financial strategy and continued to support and grow our very strong customer relationships. The resulting sustainability of the core business and growth in the data center business will support our target of achieving consistent 5% plus organic adjusted EBITDA growth flowing through to AFFO growth and generate returns above our cost of capital. We will remain very disciplined in our capital allocation decisions, balancing investments that will create value for shareholders, whilst providing more solutions to our customers. With that operator, please open up the call to Q&A.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead. 
Sheila McGrath: Yes, good morning. Bill, at first quarter, you did have some impact from excess labor that impacted margins. It looks like you righted the ship better than your guidance in second quarter. I was just wondering if you could update us on cost optimization initiatives, how they’re progressing and if you have any change in how you expect the margin improvements to play out for the second half of the year.
Bill Meaney: Thanks, Sheila. So yes, we were pleased as you noted that we were above our guidance in terms of sequential EBITDA margin improvement. We’ve updated the guidance by actually tightening the range and what we do, we will see is continuing stepped up of the margin over the course of the year. In other words, there will be a ramp in the second half of the year, but we feel really good about the line of sight that we have to be able to finish up the year in strong shape.  So the improvements that we made in Q2 more than offset the – change things structurally that more than offset that missed on the labor in the first quarter. So we feel really good in terms of the setup for the second half, but there will be a ramp.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, great. And I just wanted your view on the markets not giving you credit clearly right now for the premium dividend yields given where shares are, just your like bigger picture thoughts on either bringing in the capital partner on some of the data centers, so to create liquidity to buy back shares at these levels.
Bill Meaney: Well, I think we’re – I think you probably appreciate, we’re not going to talk about the buy back on the call. But from a capital allocation standpoint is a board. We look at everything about in terms of where we invest money and how we deploy that and that includes everything from how we give money back to the shareholders whether that’s through a dividend or share buyback.  So everything is always on the table when we look at it. But I think dividend yields, at some point that your shares become pretty good value. But we’re not – we looked at the full range of options right now. We really like the capital allocation decisions we have in terms of growing the data center business and also building out our business – our traditional business in emerging markets in some of our new digital solutions and we’re seeing the growth. And I’m always the optimist. I feel that at some point our dividend yield reflects probably a lack of appreciation for what we’re doing as a company and eventually gravity does reinsert itself in that, that itself correcting if the share price goes up.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: The next question is from Nate Crossett of Berenberg. Please go ahead. 
Nate Crossett: Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on that margin improvement question. I think on the last call, you kind of got into 600 basis points ramp by the year end. So I know you said that it’s going to ramp through year end, but is that 600 give or take still in place.
Stuart Brown: Hey Nate, this is Stuart. Yes, if you look at the ramp in the margin that’s implied, I think that the way to look at it, right, if you think about sort of Q2 normalized EBITDA adjusting for the $10 million that we talked about Q2 normalized EBITDA was that $361 million. So guidance of the $1,440 or $1,480 by just backing into what the second half EBITDA growth is and plus in EBITDA growth of 7.65% to 8.05%, but on that range. So that’s a ramp in Q2 normalize about $20 million to $40 million per quarter.  And you think about even just the first quarter, we improve $35 million from the first quarter. So the ramp and EBITDA margins, you should continue to see and the benefits that we get as we move through the year, we talked about in the last quarter call, right. We’ve got revenue management and most of our pricing takes place in Q2 actually more of it takes place in Q3. So you get the benefit as we move through the year of pricing. And then the continuous improvement initiatives that Bill touched on led by the global operations support team, which really continues to focus on improve labor productivity, particularly in things like Latin America service margin focused on fleet utilization and number of other areas. We’ve got initiatives underway to meet the guidance.
Nate Crossett: Okay, thanks. And then on just the organic growth number, I appreciate your comments on how much customer acquisitions effects that number. And so I just want to be clear that if you take the 2.2% and you subtract 60 basis points, is that 1.6% a true same-store metric by real estate standards or…
Stuart Brown: I don’t think you can compare it to real estate standards, because real estate – the REIT industry does NOI on a building by building basis, you’ve got to remember the nature of our business is that we store our customers, records and information. They don’t care which building it is. So it’s not a building by building basis, I think about for an office building or a warehouse. So that’s why its organic growth and not sort of the same-store growth. 
Nate Crossett: Okay. And then just one last question on the NoVa lease. I’d be curious to get a little more color on how you won that deal, because some of the other guys have been saying that Northern Virginia is very competitive and there’s pricing pressures. And so I’d just be curious on how you won that. 
Bill Meaney: Yes. I think look, we continued to see our down select ahead of where we have capacity deployed. And I think it’s partly because of the brand, I’d mentioned the cross selling, in fact that we – the last two quarters been consistent about getting 40% of our lead generation from the other side of the traditional side of the business. And our focus on those customers that are heavily regulated have very high requirements, which is mainly financial services, government and healthcare.  I mean, not that all our customers are in those categories, but that’s kind of our focus. So we continue, we look at Northern Virginia, I totally take your point. There’s a lot of capacity in Northern Virginia. It is the largest data center market globally. So there’s also a lot of absorption. But that focus I think it’s a lot of to build a pretty good pipeline. We feel really good about the pipeline we have for the Northern Virginia right now. 
Nate Crossett: Okay. Thanks, guys. 
Operator: The next question is from Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Eric Luebchow: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on the Northern Virginia lease. I know we’ve heard from some of your competitors that pricing and returns have been kind of compressed there. So I’m just curious for some of these larger scale leases, if you’re underwriting kind of a lower return, but longer contract duration or how you kind of look at that balance particularly as you sign these larger scale leases and data centers? 
Bill Meaney: It’s a good question, Eric. So let me ask the question two different ways. So we actually had quite a bit of leasing activity in Northern Virginia in Q2 and we see those at kind of normal rates when I’m talking about the retail sector or retail contracts or leases. On the specific 6 megawatts that is a hyperscale lease. So we’re seeing kind of the 8% to 9% cash on cash returns, which is where we built our business model. So that will, when you start seeing that come through, you’ll see that at a lower rate, but it’s in – but we think it’s very consistent, not just with Northern Virginia, globally, we expect those kinds of cash on cash returns when we sign up a hyperscale customer.  You’re obviously getting bigger deployments. So the – when you actually look at the overall returns – in the returns on the campus, as we said, I think previously on calls as we think that they maximize or optimize returns on a campus the size of Northern Virginia. We expect to have somewhere between 40% and 50% of the leases in those kind of 8% to 9% cash on cash returns when the site is fully built out and it’s consistent with that. But I would say the pricing on that 6 megawatts is less to do with Northern Virginia to do with the returns that are in the market for those types of customers.
Eric Luebchow: Okay, thanks. That’s helpful. And then just one more for me, given that you took data center development CapEx up $50 million, curious how that impacts your leverage outlook for this year and into next year versus previously. And then could you talk about potentially your ability to recycle more of your industrial real estate portfolio above the $100 million that – $100 million plus you have in your guidance? 
Stuart Brown: Yes. Thanks, Eric. As we’ve said over the last couple of quarters, we see ourselves landing lease adjusted leverage of around 5.5 times at the end of the year. If you look at sort of how it’s goings to come down from where it was at the end of Q2, right. We’ve benefited really from three things. First of all, the increasing EBITDA year-over-year, right. The leverage is calculated on trailing 12-month basis. Second, the capital recycling underway. We’ve got a sale leaseback portfolio in the market now of industrial properties and a second property, we’re about to start marketing.  So feel very confident in the $100 million plus that was just built into our guidance currently. We could do more there is a lot of demand out there for industrial real estate. We’re trying to be prudent and sort of prudent the portfolio the right way. The third thing to call out is the data center leasing. Because the way our covenants work in our credit facility as we get credit, because it’s a trailing 12-month basis, on development properties, we get credit for leases that have been signed. So because you’ve put the capital out to develop it upfront, so you get all 12 months of EBITDA credit related to those leases, so that also helps get to the around 5.5 times. 
Eric Luebchow: Okay, great. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Blake Johnson: Good morning. This is Blake on for George. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like organic volume growth in other international was supported by growth in new sales in the quarter. Can you discuss specific storage volume trends that impacted new sales and other international? Are you seeing increasing demand in emerging markets or anything else that would be great?
Bill Meaney: Good morning, Blake. Thanks for that. Yes, I think we – I think overall, not just I would say in emerging markets, but if we look at our commercial pipeline in our records management business globally is – it’s still – it’s very healthy, because obviously that’s what we look for to give with our confidence going forward into the further quarters.  So just generally, I would say across the globe, we have a pretty good commercial pipeline over the next 12 months to 18 months. Specifically on emerging markets, if we continue to see that, it’s usually in markets like India for instance, where there’s still a very large, what I call on unvended opportunity. I think I might have mentioned previously, there’s a specific customer in India that we just want a part of their business. Historically, it was all in house, there was over 20 million cubic feet. This is a single customer in India.  So if you think about North America, which is 500 million cubic feet in total, there’s a single customer in India that has over 20 million cubic feet in house. So that just gives you the scale of the type of pipeline at we’re building our line of sight to future demand that we have in some of these markets. So we continue to be quite encouraged by what we’re building.
Blake Johnson: Great. Thank you for that. Also previously you had discussed specific initiatives of the global operations team including transportation cost deficiencies. Can you discuss progress on these initiatives and what your expectations are for the remainder of the year?
Stuart Brown: Yes, Blake, again, it’s built into our guidance. I want to talk about specific results of the initiatives. But yes, we’ve got a number of initiatives going on both to improve efficiency in North America transportation. When we look at our data management business and fleet in the records management business efficiencies on the labor side, particularly focused in Latin America where labor productivity, we think we’ve got some improvements there as we take some of the labor standards that we’ve employed here in North America.  Some of the efficiencies where just to give you a specific example, in Latin America, we traditionally staffed each project team separately, we’re in North America, we sort of cross train people better and we can use them across projects. We’re putting that same initiative in place in Latin America, which will help Latin America service margins as well.  So there are a number of things going on. I think we’ve got – if we total up each initiative from the global operations support team, I mean there’s well worth – well north of 50 different things that they’re working on to keep taking cost as part of our continuous improvement initiative. I think having a global knowledge is really cross breed ideas of faster and implement them faster across the organization.
Blake Johnson: Great, very helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: The next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
Andrew Steinerman : Good morning. Looking at Slide 14, bullet one, you raised your organic revenue growth storage range from a quarter ago, it was 1.75% to 2.5% and now it’s 2.2% to 2.8%. What factors give you confidence to take up the range? Maybe what are the most important facts to take up the range? Is it lower destruction, higher revenue management, higher backlog? Just give us a relative sense of what are the most important factors that improved over the last quarter.
Bill Meaney: Andrew, good morning. You almost answered the question for me. It’s pretty much three of your four. So if you think about it, first of all, we’re looking at the commercial pipeline, when we move these ranges. So really liked in terms of the pipeline that the – and we look at what stage they are in the pipeline in terms of how long we can speak to the customer. So that’s one aspect.  Destructions are ticked down slightly. So last year I think they were up, destructions were up. So if you look at this year as they trending back to what I would call more normal levels. I wouldn’t say they’re down unusually, but they’ve come down from last year. So that’s the second aspect. And the other thing is, we’re getting, especially in North America, we’re getting more joy from our pricing initiatives that we’ve actually rolled out pricing initiatives to customers where we were a little bit [indiscernible] those seems to be sticking pretty well. So it’s a combination of revenue management, especially – specifically in North America. And then looking at destruction levels going back to kind of where I will call more norms and then looking ahead at the commercial pipeline.
Andrew Steinerman : Right. And could you just give a reason why you feel like distractions are normalizing now and what gives us confidence that, that’s going to stick?
Bill Meaney: Well, first of all, these are relatively small movements, but they have sizable impact, right. Because you’re talking about small movements, if you just on a business of 700 million cubic feet. So a little bit of change and that can make big differences. The – I think last year, we all have our own hypothesis. We speak to customers all the time, but many times of our customers are crisp in their response. But I think last year probably, it was a combination of some of the GDPR cleanup, people were going into bring themselves into compliance and destroying a lot of their documentation rather than trying to bring it into compliance. And then the other aspect is we did get some legal holes that got released in the financial service industry. So I think those two things alone, probably attracted a bit of it. It’s the best feedback we’re getting from our customers at this point. So our expectations that will kind of trend at the more, what I would call usual levels pre-last year, and you can see that kind of bleeding through this year.
Andrew Steinerman : Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. Can you delve a little bit more into the pricing in North America, you said, I think you described it, Bill, as getting more joy over there. What exactly is it – are there charges there in put through straight off contracts? Is it something that you feel is, as a sustainable thing that you could do on a regular basis? If you could just give us just a little sense of that.
Bill Meaney: Okay. Good morning, Shlomo. So I think the kind of two aspects, I mean, one is watching the story is about two-thirds of our pricing actions come in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So we have that normal uptick. But specifically and what’s different this year than last year. It is that – quite frankly, if we started rolling out revenue management, the ones you’re always shy of is your largest customers, right, because there is any elasticity. Obviously, you feel it in volume in larger dimensions. I think the last couple of years have given us confidence as a team and specifically more North America, that we’re able to rollout the same kind of revenue management or pricing discipline to our larger customers as we were to come by midsize customers. And that was built on a confidence with mid-size customers and as we’ve gone into this year, in the first half of the year, we’ve seen that we have been able to actually achieve that. So lot of this, I think I’ve mentioned before on pricing, a lot of it is change management internally. In other words, giving our folks the confidence that they can charge the right price for the service that we’re delivering.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And then if you could just an – in the supplemental Slide 9, the records management in Developed Markets. So there’s a trend that tend to be going on from like 4Q, where the volumes were declining sequentially. You bucked the trend in 1Q, ticked up and then its down again in 2Q. Why is that trending down even if destruction seem to be moderating. I’m just trying to get a handle as is the trend continuing downwards. Or are we stabilizing? Just trying to get a sense of what’s going on there?
Bill Meaney: Yes, I think it’s more of a stabilized trend. I mean, if you look at the, specifically, on the developed markets, the chart that you’re referring to, is if you’re going to go down into the detail, I’d say, a moderation in terms of new sales in Q2, but if you kind of look at over 12 month basis, that goes up and down. So when we look at that and we look at giving our projections going forward, if we look at the commercial pipeline. So I think it is – developed markets will be – as we said, it will be more on the negative side of neutral, so I think, it will be a slight downward tick more than offset by revenue management. So we built that into our projections and at the end of the day, what we’re delivering is total organic revenue sales, our organic storage sales. We feel really comfortable with that. But in terms of looking at the volume that your question that you’re asking is, we then look forward at the commercial pipeline. We think it’s going to be kind of in that range, it kind of up and down.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. If I could just sneak in last one, that 20 million cubic feet customer in India, when – is that already rolling in now? What – when is that supposed to roll in? That sounds like an actually a pretty big deal, for which kind of business.
Bill Meaney: I wish it was the whole 20 million. They’re not outsourcing everything that they have. And they actually split it between two of us. Actually, we got more than half. So we got the bulk of it. So they didn’t outsource the whole 20 million. I think over time they will and that’s already starting to flow into our Indian operation.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Andy Wittmann: Okay, thanks for taking my question guys. Stuart, I appreciated your comments on the acquisition of customer relationships, otherwise known in the industry as the pickup and move business. I guess, as I look at this, I want to understand it a little bit more. I guess, last year you guys spent about $60 million, this year you’re on track for about $90 million for these types of customer relationship acquisitions. You mentioned that, you pay a sales commission anyway, and so there’s costs either way. What is the delta in cost, if you look out on a per box basis or some normalized basis between the two as you compare them. I mean, $90 million this year, I mean, it’s clearly driving growth. You said 60 basis points of volume. But how does that compare? It seems like, it’s more expensive than a sales commission, but why don’t you help us understand that a little bit more?
Stuart Brown: Yes. I think it’s actually not very complicated, right? So on average, we’ve spend, I think probably at $60 million a year and this year, I would expect this to be sort of around that as well. And that includes, mostly boxes, mostly in the developed business and the developed markets. Some of it’s little bit of it in the shred business as well. So it gets sort of spread between the two. And as we said before, typically, we will bring in 3 million to 4 million cubic feet a year in tuck-in. When you’re comparing the cost between, bring it in through a salesperson or you typically get a number of different costs, because when you bring it to salesperson, depending upon if it’s at the customers today or in the competitors, you get some different costs. So you’ve got the sales commissioning you have to pay, but you’re right is a portion of it. If it’s at a competitor, you’re often reimbursing the customer for their permanent withdrawal fees that they’ve got to pay for the competitor, right, which can be pretty substantial. And so you compare that to a [indiscernible] we are typically paying around three times revenue. You actually don’t get that much of a difference, but you get the volume benefit and efficiency benefits of doing it and moving it one time efficiently. And once you’re fully integrated and synergized, you’re at about a 90% margin, so the flow through that’s really good. So you’ve got a payback of less than four years with integration costs. Which is giving you a cash on cash return of 25%. So our goal is to be transparent about it. We view it as organic and because it is like a sales or some other competitive takeaway. We provide the information to investors, but it is part of our organic growth and we think about it that way as part of our organic capital spend as well.
Andy Wittmann: Okay. That’s super helpful. So in there, I heard that you’re expecting actually $60 million for customer relationships. So I’m sorry if I misquote you in my question there, where I said its 90. So that implies not the difference between the $90 million, that’s in your $515 million and the $60 million, you mentioned there is the customer inducements, which are basically – those come out from withdrawal fees. Is that the right way to think about it?
Stuart Brown: Yes, that’s correct.
Andy Wittmann: Okay, cool. That’s what I wanted to understand. Thank you for your help.
Operator: The next question comes from Marlane Pereiro from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Marlane Pereiro: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just had a quick question regarding, can you talk about funding the $395 million of incremental capital for investments and getting leverage to around 5.5 times by year end?
Stuart Brown: Yes, I think I touched on this. There’s couple of different ways to look at it. I mean, I’ve touched on the leverage change from year to year end, both from the capital recycling and the thing to remember, Marlene, is that as EBITDA growth, right. That allows you to borrow against that and still reduce leverage. So if our EBITDA growth $100 million organically per year, you can see a radically at five times borrow $500 million and still reduce leverage from where we are at the mid five levels. So you can do both at the same time and fund those capital needs.
Marlane Pereiro: Great. So just to be clear, you do expect as communicated last quarter that you expect leverage to kind of to get down to roughly that 5.5 area.
Stuart Brown: Yes, which is – I repeated that in my opening remarks as well.
Marlane Pereiro: Yes. Great, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Hello?
Bill Meaney: Yes.
Kevin McVeigh: Can you hear me? Hey, Bill or Stuart. Nice job on the margin sequentials, the paper headwinds weren’t as much as what we had modeled. Can you help us understand what you use and for the spot price kind of where that came in the quarter. And then how we should think about that over the balance of the year?
Stuart Brown: Yes. Kevin. I appreciate the question, because there’s been a number of questions about it. Let me start off with, our initial guidance already assumed that paper prices would be declining. So our initial guidance, we assume that paper prices would decline about $10 per ton from 2018 and on a price per ton basis, $10 per ton equates to about $6 million of EBITDA. So if you so to say, okay, what’s now inherited our current assumptions and Bill touched on his remarks, I did as well. If paper prices stay at current levels and that’s down about $40 per ton from a year ago, right. That $40 per ton is about $25 million, impact year-over-year, right. And so if you think about it versus guidance, that’s about $20 million headwind relative to our guidance. Other things just for people to remember as well, we have really high quality sorted office papers, when we go into market to sell. We do sell it at a higher price and what people maybe saying in the index.
Kevin McVeigh: That’s helpful. And then just Stuart, what was it that kind of helped the margin recovery? I mean, I know in the first quarter, it was kind of there were some unexpected cost around labor, things like that. What were you able to put in place that kind of help boost the sequential and then the improvement that we’ll see over the balance of the year?
Stuart Brown: Remember, that despite the $10 million of headwinds that we booked as well. And again, we came out of – we talked about in the first quarter call, we came out with a lot of confidence in terms of our ability to recover, the fact was that the labor issue that we had in first quarter was late in the quarter, we could have recovered in the quarter. And again, I think from an execution, from our operations teams out there around the world, now the ones who really get the credit, both Bill touched on the revenue management of programs we’ve got in place, cost takeout, there’s a lot of work we have to do, right. There’s a lot of opportunities for us in terms of levers in the company to move margins and to get more efficient and we work on delivering those every day.
Kevin McVeigh: Got it. But was that maybe, I guess, can you give us some examples was it like maybe lower bonuses to drivers or was it just any thoughts on kind of…
Stuart Brown: Absolutely not. We’re not taking this out of the backs of our – of the mountain here is out there who are serving our customers every day. If you look, you can see labor efficiencies, our labor actually year-over-year as a percentage of revenue is down. There is some price flow through, again most of them come through in the back half of the year. And then efficiencies and just other costs of sales as well around transportation in some of the other areas.
Kevin McVeigh: Got to, okay. Thank you.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-25 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greer Aviv, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Greer Aviv: Thank you, Kate. Hello, and welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The user controlled slides that we will refer to in today's prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations site along with a link to today's webcast. You can find the presentation, earnings press release and the full supplemental financial information at ironmountain.com under about us/investors/events and presentations. On today's call, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss first quarter performance and progress towards our strategic plans; followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover additional financial information and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call to Q&A. Referring now to the Page 2 of the presentation. Today's earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2019 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and a reconciliations to these measures as required by Reggie are included in the supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin.
William Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. The first quarter of 2019 was marked by continued progress against our strategic plan. Some of the highlights included: revenue growth ahead of our expectations, solid global volume performance from our traditional records business, progress and increasing our exposure to new storage areas, in part highlighted by the recently announced MakeSpace JV in the consumer storage area and continued build out of our data center business. Tempering this progress was the underperformance of adjusted EBITDA against our expectations for the quarter of - by approximately $10 million. We should emphasize, however, we remain confident in achieving our budget expectations in line with the full year guidance targets we issued in February. Continuing from this summary in a little bit more detail, as you saw in our earnings materials, revenue growth in record storage volumes continued to be very durable with total revenues increasing 4.5% on a constant currency basis, whilst our organic storage revenue grew 2% consistent with the 1.9% organic storage growth recorded in Q4. Our revenue performance was slightly ahead of our expectations due to strong volume and revenue management and despite softer service revenue, we expect total revenue to remain on track with our outlook for the year. Separately, we experienced higher-than-anticipated labor cost, which are temporary in our secured destruction or shred business. This was the single biggest contributor to our adjusted EBITDA underperforming our expectations by $10 million or 3% for the quarter. Let me give you a bit more color what led to the earnings results this quarter. Our performance remains on track with our expectations in the first 2 months of the year with our underperformance occurring primarily in our shred business during the month of March. Shred increased head count in an overall attempt to reduce overtime that we did not achieve the reduction necessary to deliver the targeted level, which resulted in unanticipated higher labor costs. Our confidence in delivering full year guidance is in part driven from the investment we made at the beginning of the year in our global operations support team. This team is tasked with driving improvement in both operating in overhead cost globally. As a number of these improvements continue in their implementation, we expect it will ultimately lead to more of a marked improvement and performance in the second half of the year. Moreover, we believe a number of these initiatives will result in a stronger exit rate than we initially planned. From a strategic standpoint, this implies we expect to exit 2019 with an organic adjusted EBITDA growth rate of approximately 4.5% and on track towards our target of 5% for the end of 2020. Stuart will provide more detail around our expectation for the rest of the year including other items impacting comparability. After adjusting out the $10 million of the unfavorable cost performance, you'll see that the first quarter corporate overhead cost increases year-over-year as we continue to invest in operational improvement as well as continued investment in innovation and new product development. These investments are in some areas already leading to both the identification of areas for improved cost performance and revenue opportunities, which should continue to both drive future growth in earnings and fund our growth in dividends to investors. Our recent example of the - one recent example this could be seen in our continued progress with our insight platform and partnership with Google. 3 weeks ago, at Google Next, Google awarded Iron Mountain its artificial intelligence and machine learning partner of the year. We are proud of receiving this award in an area so important in the realm of information management. Let me now turn to volume performance in the quarter as well as changes to our volume reporting, which can be seen in our quarterly earnings supplement. As Stuart mentioned last quarter, we took a fresh look at our disclosures to streamline where possible as well has insured we are providing our shareholders and analysts value-added information to properly evaluate our businesses and related performance. We revised our volume recording to better reflect how we manage the business and provide visibility into our comprehensive portfolio of physical storage solutions above and beyond records including Tape, Valet Consumer Storage and our Adjacent Businesses of fine arts storage and entertainment services. Whilst the non-box storage currently only represents approximately 1% of our storage volume, we believe these areas have the opportunity to represent a significant amount of growth going forward. Turning to our actual volume results for Q1. By all measures, it was a solid quarter for volume growth. First, let me focus on organic volume growth from our traditional records management business. In the first quarter globally, our cubic feet of record storage increased from 686 million cubic feet a year ago to 696 million cubic feet with $2.4 million of the $10 million cubic organic, delivering 30 basis points of the year-over-year growth. Moreover, during the first quarter, we delivered growth of 3 million cubic feet organically or increase of 40 basis points. Breaking the worldwide volume down further, we continued to see a consistent trend in North America with a decline of 130 basis points year-over-year. This is a slight improvement from recent quarters due to lower destructions and flat Q4 to Q1 organically. Western Europe and other international continue to deliver consistent levels of organic volume growth, 2% and 3%, respectively year-over-year. Turning to our new reporting of storage volume achieved form Adjacent Businesses, primarily fine arts and entertainment services and consumer, we have routinely included these businesses when reporting or revenue per square foot and occupancy, but not in our volume reporting. Starting this year, we will also provide a breakdown of the volume stored in these businesses. You can see in our reporting that these businesses while small have delivered approximately 5 million cubic feet of net growth over the last 2 years, representing 20% of the overall volume growth for the company. Moreover, we see the volume contribution of these businesses accelerating as we continue to build further scale in these relatively new storage areas for Iron Mountain. A good example of this growth potential is illustrated by our recent expansion in the consumer through the partnership with MakeSpace. We're excited about the opportunity to serve as a logistics and storage arm in the valet consumer space. This venture combines the strongest capabilities from both of our organizations that leverage is MakeSpace a strong brand and front end customer acquisition technology platform with our world-class operational scales and logistics expertise. Iron Mountain has the opportunity to accelerate growth in the consumer market the MakeSpace's strong market position and ambition to expand into new markets. Finally, we continue to make steady progress in our data center business. You will see in this quarter, we signed a new or expanded leases for almost 4 megawatts versus the 3.3 megawatts in Q4 on a total build out capacity of a little over 100 megawatts. Whilst today, data center is about 6% of total revenue, it is already contributing more than a third of our annual EBITDA growth. Before handing the call over to Stuart, I wish to reiterate that we remain confident in the health of the underlying business characterized by the growth in revenue from our records and information management business as well as the increased momentum of our growth portfolio including Emerging Markets and data center. While we're disappointed by the cost impact this quarter, we continue to see the full year in line with our guidance and with an expected slightly improved exit rate going into 2020. With that, I will turn the call over to Stuart.
Stuart Brown: Thank you, Bill, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2019 results. I'll start off the details around Q1 performance, with additional information around the cost control issues and overall results, including the initiatives you're taking to expand margins and deliver on your expectations for the remainder of the year. Slide 7 of the presentation summarizes our quarter's financial results. As Bill mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter revenue, which approach $1.1 billion, reflecting growth of 4.5% on a constant currency basis. Storage rental revenue increased 5.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in our data center, emerging markets and fine arts businesses and better organic volume performance. Service revenue increased 3.5% excluding currency changes. Total organic revenue grew by 1.9% in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Organic storage revenue grew 2% for the quarter or about $13 million, supported by good results by an revenue management and from organic records management volume growth, which increased 30 basis points in the quarter and acceleration for prior quarters. Organic service revenue grew by 1.8% in the first quarter, a bit less than we anticipated to the lower box destructions in North America, lower project revenue globally and lower prices for recycled paper. The gross profit margin declined 70 basis point from last year to 56.3%, due in part to the operational issues Bill discussed as well as a 20 basis points impact in the change in lease accounting. I'll have more on the cost actions we're undertaking in a moment. Our adjusted EBITDA declined $18.5 million or 5.4% to $325 million, with the margins contracting 210 basis points year-over-year to 30.8%. Excluding the impact of currency changes, adjusted EBITDA declined $8.7 million or 2.6%. In addition to the cost of sales already discussed, the margin contraction reflects SG&A excluding significant acquisition costs, growing 140 basis points as a percentage of revenue or almost $18 million from the year-ago. The increase in SG&A reflects higher IT-related costs, including information security and investments in our digital offerings like the Iron Mountain insight platform and partnership with Google. We also invested in a new global operational support group and added G&A with last year's data center acquisitions. Most of this increase in SG&A was anticipated and reflects strategic initiatives and reflect the future. Turning to other metrics, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.17 per share, down from $0.24 per share a year ago. AFFO in the quarter was $193 million, down approximately $28 million from the prior year, reflecting the adjusted EBITDA decline, increased interest expense and slightly higher cash taxes compared to a year ago. Looking at organic revenue growth on Slide 8. You can see developed markets organic storage, rental revenue came in at 1.1% for the quarter, slightly better than Q4 2018, reflecting contribution from revenue management and improved volume performance. Organic service revenue in developed markets increased 1.8% for the quarter, a moderation from the levels seen in 2018, due mainly to lower destruction service revenues, paper prices which have moderated from recent highs and one fewer working day in the quarter. In other international, we saw continued healthy organic storage revenue growth of 4.6% for the quarter and 3.3% growth in organic volume. Organic service revenue declined 0.6% in this segment, due mainly to a slowdown in project revenue. In the supplemental, you can see the data center business delivered organic revenue growth of around 3% for the quarter. Adjusted for the churn in Phoenix, we called out that last quarter, the underlying organic revenue growth was about 9% similar to levels seen in Q4. Churn in the quarter was about 1.4%, when normalized with a phoenix moveouts, which were anticipated when we acquired IO last year. As Bill mentioned, we're trending well towards our target of leasing 15 to 20 megawatts for the year. Aggregated data center leasing in the quarter and the related rate per kilowatt included 1.6 megawatts of powered shell in New Jersey, space which was vacant when we acquired IO. Our Adjacent Businesses also performed well, with revenue growing 10% on an organic basis in the quarter. With the international scale, we have now built, we continue to see very healthy demand from galleries museums and studios. Slide 9 details the adjusted EBITDA margin performance our business segments. On a year-over-year basis, total margins were impacted by the increase in SG&A. The North America RIM margin declined by about 40 basis points largely because of our shredding business, as previously discussed, while the changes in lease accounting impact margin and a segment about 20 basis points this quarter. North America data management margin declined continues to be driven by lower volumes and investments we're making a new products and services, including Iron Mountain. Revenue management is helping to offset some of the declines support healthy margins, which remain above 50%. In Western Europe, first quarter margins contracted 230 basis points, reflecting higher temporary facilities cost and consulting cost for process improvements in France. Other international margins were up 10 basis points in the quarter, despite a 70 basis point impact from the adoption of new lease accounting standards. In the Global Data Center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins were 42.3% in the first quarter, reflecting the acquisition of EvoSwitch in the Netherlands last May, which operates at lower average margins and the impact of the Phoenix churn, which as mentioned, was anticipated. Turning to Slide 10. You can see that our lease adjusted leverage ratio at Q1 was 5.8x, modestly higher than the year-end primarily due to the softer adjusted EBITDA performance. We expect levers to decline in the back half of the year, the capital recycling proceeds and expectations for increase adjusted EBITDA and to end the year around 5.5x as we guided to last quarter. We're on track with our capital recycling program and subsequent to the end of the first quarter, close to a number of real estate sales, generating net proceeds of over $40 million as we consolidate into our new U.K. records facility. We've spent more than $15 million of additional risk that capital for the remainder of the year and are evaluating third-party capital via joint venture to fund the Frankfurt data center development. Before discussing outlook, I want to take a moment to outline the plan to improve margins this year and set us up for success in 2020 and beyond. First, we've been in place over 2 dozen operating initiatives. Without going into details on all of the initiatives, 1 example is improving transportation costs both routing and fleet utilization. This was result in higher-than-previously-anticipated expense in Q2, there's one time in nature but should reduce fate and transportation cost in the back of the year and continuing to 2020. Other steps being taken include further labor initiatives and vendor consolidation to reduce supply costs. Second, as previously discussed, we created a global operations support team at the end of last year to identify areas of improvement, focused and additional your labor, transportation cost in revenue management. This includes expanding the use of productivity management tools, with engineered labor standards to improve service margins globally as well as the centralization and standardization of transportation training. The first half of 2019 includes cost to establish the team and some third-party professional fees, and we expect to see the benefits in our results beginning in the second half of the year and into 2020. Turning to guidance. We're reaffirming the range that we provided in your Q4 call in February and remain confident that we can achieve despite the first quarter performance expected residual effect on the second quarter and headwinds from declining recycled paper prices. The operating lower end of our guidance remains a little wider due to uncertainty with regard to exchange rates. We continue to expect a total organic revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 2.5% in 2019, including organic storage revenue growth of 1.75% to 2.5%. We continue to expect service organic revenue growth in the low single digits, though the second quarter will be flattish as we are cycling against tire destruction service revenue in much higher paper prices. While we not generally provide quarterly guidance, given the cost issues experienced towards the end of the first quarter, we wanted to provide some further color on our expectations for the rest of the year. We expect some of the higher labor costs to secure destruction will continue into the second quarter until our actions, which are already underway, again improving cost of sales. We also expect some onetime cost associated with the operational improvement initiatives, I described earlier. However, SG&A cost should decline sequentially and as a result, we expect the adjusted EBITDA margins in the second quarter to increase 150 to 200 basis points from the first quarter. Margins should then improve 200 to 300 basis points per quarter through the second half of 2019 as cost improvements initiatives flow through. As Bill noted, we remain committed to the full-year guidance to provide on our last earnings call. In summary, Q1 performance reflects a strong underlying health and shows the contribution from revenue management and improved volume trends. We continue to see good results from the efforts to extend in the high-growth markets in our data center platform in Adjacent Businesses are shelling encouraging progress as the gain greater scale. We're confident that the actions we're implementing to improve margins allow us to achieve our long-term targets. Then, operator, we'll move to the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Sheila McGrath of Evercore.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. Just on adjusted SG&A as a percent of revenue for the quarter, it was, as you acknowledge, elevated at 25.5%. I'm just wondering how much is attributable to labor? Or what are other drivers of that increase?
William Meaney: No. I mean the majority of increase is - you get a few things going on. First of all, the increase year-over-year from a dollar basis, we've - with Acquisition of EvoSwitch and then IO late in January last year, you're getting some increase in overall, overhead cost because of that. And then you're also getting increase in operations team, which we operate in cost of that team as well as some consulting cost. And those are the 2 biggest drivers. And so when you think about the global operations team as we stood that out, you've got cost in the first quarter and continued in the first half of the year and those will switch into benefits as they more than pay for themselves in the second half of the year. And as we sort of think about it as we said these things up, right? We're taking cost earlier this year as we're really trying to get them to pay for themselves within the year. We are going to go ahead and just sort of given the operational issues accelerates some things that we would have spread up later in the year and put those forward into Q2.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. Great. And then just following up on the MakeSpace acquisition. I just wonder how you view that business setting in it at Iron Mountain? How are you integrating it? Will that business we with Iron Mountain trucks? And how the margin compare to traditional's - your traditional storage business?
William Meaney: No, it's a good question, Sheila. So first of all, we're a significant by minority shareholders at JV. So it set up as a JV rather than integrating MakeSpace. So for us, the perfect relationship. So besides being a large minority shareholder in the company, we're also the exclusive provider of the back and services. In the back and services means that our trucks and drivers picking up the material or delivering the material in our facilities soaring. So we're the exclusive service provider to that joint venture, which effectively gets us in the consumer space with a B2B relationships. So we're still a business-to-business with MakeSpace, and we get the benefit of their understanding of the consumer space. And they've proven themselves, not only to have a very effective brand and marketing approach, but very efficient acquisition cost of customers. So we're pretty excited about the relationship. From their spit standpoint, is that we bring the logistics and handling expertise that quite frankly both them and other consumer self-storage companies have struggled with and this particular area. So we're able to leverage what really as our core strength. And also use our real estate footprint. So they're pretty excited because we're able to help them expand much quicker across the United States because we're already in the United States. So we think it's actually very synergistic relationship that we've been able to carve out with them.
Sheila McGrath: So the venture will store the - in your facilities?
William Meaney: Yes, exactly. Exactly.
Operator: The next question is from Nate Crossett of Berenberg.
Nathan Crossett: I saw on the presentation that you're seeking JV partners for the Frankfurt DC project. So I was wondering if you could maybe provide some color on what that might look like? And maybe the types of providers you are looking to maybe partner with? And then just a follow on to that, just curious to hear your overall comments on the European data center market as we're heading that demand is pretty strong, especially in the flap areas?
William Meaney: So Nathan, select me start with the last question and then Stuart was talking about how we think about joint ventures generally and specifically why we called it up that we're considering up for Frankfort. So you're right. I mean we remain bullish on the European data center markets. So we're really pleased in terms we've been able to establish a strong footprint, both in London in the floor space with the acquisition and out with the EvoSwitch in Amsterdam. So we're really happy with that. And now with the land in Frankfurt. So as you know, Franklin, London, Amsterdam and Paris are considered top markets in Europe and the growth there continues to see - we see robust growth across both the wholesale market as well as the retail market. So we're - so far we're really pleased in terms of what's happening here. But I think they probably came into their own a little bit behind where the U.S. outsourcing. But they're definitely picking up pace at a really good rate.
Stuart Brown: Yes, on the Frankfurt joint venture that we're evaluating, yes, it's lots of capital out there looking to be put to work in the data center business and the type of structure would be looking at would be something fairly typical for other REIT. Why Frankfurt? Is really because if you look at some of the development we've got in the other markets in Amsterdam and Arizona, there's frankly, would be probably too many conflicts with our existing. So Frankfurt is easy to carve out into its own joint venture, wouldn't be any conflicts with the existing Iron Mountain properties. And we're in the early phases of that. And we will evaluate demands are. So we're looking for long-term partner who can invest with us in Frankfurt and then we wanted to consider other markets outside of that will be open to that as well.
Nathan Crossett: Okay. That's helpful. And is there any preference is there any public or private. There the public eye on the best of potential JV? Or can you give any...
William Meaney: It's most likely a long-term pension-type money that's looking for these type of investments, it could be some of these are going to be in this for long time as we build it out.
Nathan Crossett: Okay. That's helpful. And then just another question on Google partnership. kind of how should we think about that in terms of bottom line numbers? And I know it's very early days, but do you expect us to want to kind of having a meaningful impact on AFFO or any color would be helpful on that.
William Meaney: We'll give you more guidance as we get into for sure in for our 2020. This year, what we've - our expectations and your expectation should be that any revenue will we get will be a watch with the cost standing this out. I think I might've mentioned in the last call is that we've done over a dozen proof of concepts across the range of industries, and we're really excited about the results that we're getting from that. So what we see this as a natural add-on to our digital standing business. So globally, we do about $200 million worth of just, what I would call, digital scanning or taking physical documents and turning it into digital formats. And that grows at high single, low double-digit organic growth. We see this as opportunity to actually accelerate that growth because people are looking to get more benefit when they actually digitize historically physical documents. So it's early days, but we really think the way we think about this is accelerating that high single-digit, low double-digit growth that we have in our digitalization business as we're - and this is the tool give more encourage them to do that.
Operator: The next question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Looking at your developed markets appears new sales pig down from 1.6% last quarter to 1.5% this quarter and New volume from existing customers also take down from 3.8% to 3.7% while discretion picked up from 4.6% to 4.9%. Can you talk about where or when you might expect from of these trends to stabilize? And what initiatives you have to potentially drive an inflection?
William Meaney: Yes, I think, George, what I would say is and it depends on which - whether you're looking quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year and if you're looking at just North America or North America and Europe. So some of the movements that you're highlighting vice important our whatever call within the range of what we expect. So we don't see any major change obviously, the result that we're reporting this quarter are better than they were reporting in the last 2 quarters. But we don't see it as a major change. So if you kind of look at overall actually, we said that destructions would be at 4.5% to 5% range. And actually in total is - yes, I'm looking at total volume now is we're at 4.5%. Any given market can kind of trench those movements. So I think you're kind of picking it at a specific market. You see overall actually destructions have gone down this quarter. If you look at the total business. But we still think whilst this nice to see 4.5% versus 5%, we still think, we're operating within that range. So I think we should see it's not going to be any big inflection point either up or down in the business. I think this is pretty much steady as she goes and where we will see it change is as we continue to make Emerging Markets a bigger part of the mix then of course globally, that will have an improvement. So the thing if you think, what do we really see has the being that will make a long-term impact? It is now that you've started to reporting the volumes of these other areas that we've been including, if you will, on our occupancy that we've never shown you how much volume it actually drives. So if you look at specifically the non-records business over the last two years, over the last two years on a non-records business so that would be the art entertainment services and now consumer. Well, in consumer we've been doing on her own for a number of years now or a number of quarters. As you'll see that those then amongst themselves generated about 5 million cubic - increased cubic over the last two years, which is about 20% of the growth of cubic feet that we've seen as a company. So small in terms of, if you look at how much it is in terms of total, but in terms of the growth, if you're looking for inflection points, those are the things that you will see changing over time. But overall, in terms of the record business, you could see it as steady as you go with a little bit of improvement consolidated has emerging markets continues to become a bigger part of the mix.
George Tong: Very helpful. Your most recent 2020 targets include revenue of $4.6 billion to $4.75 billion and EBIT target to $1.86 billion to $1.76 billion. And Jude discuss the progress in reaching those targets? And where you see EBITDA margins heading, especially given the margins are relatively FX neutral?
Stuart Brown: George, you're talking about sort of as we're sort of looking start off margin progression for the year where we expect margins to go. If you look at - for the - through first quarter, we talked about we had some unusual expenses, right? And so the guidance comments that I gave implies about 650 basis point margin improvement in Q1 to Q4, right? So I'll give you a pretty good exit rate from '19. And then if you think about in dollar terms, right? We're a little over $1 billion quarter of revenue. So that implies EBITDA dollars going up from Q1 to Q4 about $70 million. And if you think about one of the big buckets that drive that, but you normally get both revenue management as well as cost improvement initiatives as we move for the year. That will continue to be with the biggest buckets for that. You've always get the correct affections that they're taking to talk about year in this call. You will get lower SG&A as we talked about and you get the benefit from the global team which really switches before from cost of benefits from Q1 to Q4. And that's around procurements service labor and some of the other areas. So that will benefit both North America as well as the international businesses. So I think the sets us up pretty well going into 2020 for the [indiscernible] we've provided longer term.
Operator: The next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: It's Andrew. The organic revenue growth was 1.9% in the first quarter and the guide for the year is still 2.0% to 2.5%. What gives management confidence that some acceleration into organic revenue growth as I imagine moves through the year?
Stuart Brown: Andrew, this is Stuart. I mean if you - the storage is obviously from a gross profit and cash flow is the biggest driver and that's right on track. As you talk about the service revenue in Q1 and Q2, the growth will be a little bit slower than we had in the year-ago, particularly in Q2 actually going foreshadow that as recycled paper prices come down. But some of the other service areas in terms of project revenue pipeline including some of the information governance and some of the other areas will drive the service growth in the second half. So we remain quite confident in the service - implied service growth and what that means for the total.
William Meaney: And if you think about it, Andrew, is that we actually have built our confidence. Our confidence is even stronger about revenue than it was a month or 3 months ago just because we were quarter into the year. And we can see the pipeline going forward, so we feel pretty good about where we are in the revenue front.
Operator: The next question is from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird.
Andrew Wittmann: Stuart, I was just wondering the dollar strengthens here a little bit since you guys last reported, how does that fact factors into your guidance?
Stuart Brown: Yes, I mean it's our guidance range and when built them this year, we sort of changed our process on that a little bit, so we have wider EBITDA guidance this year than we used - sort of had historically over the past few years. It basically goes ahead in our dollar guidance before our guidance was around through constant currency. So I think if you look at the EBITDA impact in the first quarter of currency was actually the broad EBITDA year-over-year down a bit $10 million, that was built into our guidance. And I think where FX is today, you basically right towards the middle of guidance and the upper and lower end of the range taking into account any potential movement.
Andrew Wittmann: So last quarter, you guys talked about for the year I think you saw it was going to be a $20 million to $25 million EBITDA headwind on the [indiscernible] line, so you think it's $15 million-or-so - $10 million or $15 million for the balance of the year. Is that another way of saying the same thing?
Stuart Brown: Yes, that's about right.
Andrew Wittmann: Okay. Just on - just noticed on your kind of on your CAD schedule that there's an incremental $50 million that but I think was called out here from Frankfort and then that was offset by $50 million of capital recycling. Just given that, I wanted to get some sense of confidence around have those assets that you're going to be recycling that identified on the market whether that still kind of in the brick to figure out how that's going to translate?
William Meaney: Yes. We've got a package of that $25 million of real estate in North America, I would call it, sort of more secondary markets, Midwest markets in the market right now and seem good demands on that. And so we've got additional package up and ready to go have the first one goes. So then the bigger question around that will be recycling more real estate as the question around doesn't make sense for us to investment partnership for the Frankfurt line of purchase. Now leasing gone into some questions around time and with that. But we feel there's a lot of demand out there for JV with us, just going to make the terms make sense.
Andrew Wittmann: So is it fair to assume that $50 million number that you have in there is - that's if you were to do by all by yourself now without a partner. So that could actually not be $50 million, if you found somebody?
William Meaney: Yes, correct, correct. If we found somebody, we [indiscernible] land in it and can get capital back from that partner right away.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Funk of Bank of America.
Michael Funk: I have two quick ones, if you wouldn't mind. So looking at Slide 17 and you showed the $380 million of incremental capital needed for discretionary investments beyond the capital recycling and the JV than other sources of capital. I'd love to get your commentary on how you are thinking about maybe your comfort level with where your leverage is right now? And then you haven't issued equity in a year and half, so I want your commentary about potentially accessing the equity capital markets? I think it was last around 37 so not too far from what your equity is now. And then second question, I think last quarter you talked about revenue manager program, may be being less of a headwind in the second half - sorry, tailwind in the second half of 2019. If I'm correct about that, may be just comment on how that factors into your margin progression commentary?
William Meaney: Okay. So let me - I'll start with the revenue management and also just give you a snapshot in terms of how we think about debt overall. And then Stuart will talk a little bit more about what he's seeing in the debt markets and how well we're able to access those. So on the revenue management side, actually it's a little bit back to front from what you intimated is. Generally, in the first quarter, we see around 15% of the revenue management benefit come through in the first quarter, just the way the pricing reviews are done in the contract renewals are done with customers as we go built through the year and then it builds towards the end of the year. So well more than half comes in the last half of the year and Q2 is somewhere between Q1 and the second half of the year, if you will. So the first quarter is only about around 15% of the benefit from pricing. And we see that. This year we expect to do a little bit better than we did last year and pricing because we're starting to get some reasonable progress in the international markets, which only start coming online last year. So we feel good about fear we are with that given the first quarter performance in revenue management. Overall, just to give you a snapshot on the debt and then Stuart can give you a little bit more specifics around the access to the debt markets right now. Is generally we're not uncomfortable in terms of where we stayed with the debt we know very price. So we actually price usually at the upper end of investment grade, buys were not an investment grade data sure. So we feel relatively good about that. If you look at us our leverage relative to say that to reap peers, we're again pretty much spot on to where those folks are. And I think we have a slide, Slide 10 kind of demonstrates that in the debt. So the issue for us and the reason why we say we want to continue to de-lever over time is our covenants are roughly 6.5, and we would like 1.5 to 2 turns over time daylight between wherever our covenants are and where our leverage states. Just to give more dry powder for opportunistic events that may present themselves. So we don't feel like we are in a rush to deliver because the only thing we will deliver is to create more opportunistically. So you wouldn't do anything just to de-lever for that. And we - and given the cash generation of our business is, we feel really comfortable that we continue to grow the dividend and de-lever over time. Now in terms of equity issuance, is we look at like any investors, we look at the NAV of the company. And we say, does it make sense to actually issue equity or not? And we have an opinion right now that this is not the best time to be doing that given your share price is sitting. So we kind of look at in terms of what's the best investment. And then we also look at the best way to find that. And right now, when you look at equity you have to look at the NAV of your company, but before I headed over to Stuart is it is fair to say that we're in the data center business that we - data center is capital-intensive and growing and building data centers takes a lot of capital and hence the reason why we're looking at a partnership at Frankford. That being said, don't forget the thing that separates us from some of our data center peers is, we have an almost as north of $1.4 billion EBITDA business. And most of that generated in the mature markets in our core business, which generates a lot of cash. So what we like to say is that we have a very large strong payee bank alongside a $100 million-plus EBITDA business growing very quickly of data centers. So we actually have a natural in-house funding source that not only fuels the growth of the dividend, not only can deleverage slowly over time, not doing massive delivery, but also is a thing that allows us to do this year we guided about $250 million that we're putting into our data center business. So obviously, if we will try to put $250 million and we were $100 million EBITDA business, that would be a strain. But we're fortunate that we have another relationships that comes with that $1.5 billion EBITDA, but we - it is most of that in mature areas that we're able to harvest a fair amount of cash. But I mean, Stuart, you may want to talk about specifically the data - or the debt markets?
Stuart Brown: Yes. Let me go overall just to be - just quickly. As from an debt investor stand point, we get so much credit for the durable cash flow that comes out of the business. So as Bill mentioned, it's right, we price that close to investment grade, even though the rating agency have historically not treatise the same way. We talked about in the last earnings call. We'll actually deliver over time as EBITDA growth, right? Because if you look at for the investments are that need and incremental capital. It is around building out the data center platform. So we've had a great platform, but as we've done the acquisitions, it didn't have a lot of capacity to least out. So we have to build out and developed. So that's really what's driving the $250 million of the capital needs. And investors understand, I think the rating agency understand that as well. So quite confident as it grows and leases up, the value of the data center platform will only continue to increase. One other thing I'll add to Bill, is that when we're looking at, hey, what's the way to source that? We look at debt. We have an ATM in place again today, if you look at where the ATM is and you look at where the cap rates are an industry really states. We've chosen right now to recycle capital and some of the industry real estate some of the higher invested and if you look at our credit, people who want to do sale lease back transactions love our credit and the rates that you will see on these are really good. So we are going there.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Stuart, can you just walk me through again the labor cost in the U.S. You hired additional people in order to not have over time with the existing ones, but the timing didn't work out right. Can you just walk me through that exactly on the ground how that it works?
Stuart Brown: No, I'll give you a little bit more detail here than we normally would. With all great intentions, right would chew seen in the liver markets of North America is more demand, particularly around warehouse workers and drivers. And we took some steps last year wage rates. And with the raise in the wage rates, we were - we had a lot of overtime. So we'll take these rates up that will get offset by lower time and which is sort of a natural thing to assume. When you hire people you also have period of trainings, so your productivity is going to suffer for a little while as you're stacking up. I think what happened is we weren't managing that change very well and actually overstaffed because good news is attrition been done were able to retain people, but we did manage the productivity after the training period. And therefore, ends up with too much overtime. The month of January is a strong month for sort of - for the bin tips, it's really around sort of drivers people in the field. And so the issue really manifest itself in March when those productivity improvements, that should have been there, didn't show up. So overall, when you look overall in Iron Mountain, our labor rate as a percentage of revenue actually declined. It didn't decline as much as we expected to, and this was sort of a major cause of the issue of the shortfall in trade. Paper prices were actually down on the shred business were down a little bit below we expected it to be as well. You get paper prices in the quarter really move down and March was little bit lower. So that was a piece of the overall shred business but majority was sort of labor productivity. The good news is that the course correction as pretty quickly.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And then this is completely different though it than Western Europe? Or using the same kind of labor issues over there as margin was down as well over there with 230 basis points?
William Meaney: Yes, it's similar - the different issue the labor there was impacted greatly we had some good project revenue in Q1. Do you have a good pipeline and the project revenue in Q1 was down and we did manage some of contingent labor as well we should have on the server-side around projects. We lost some productivity and that as well. Again, correctable add regrettable as well, but you were taking actions on it.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. That's good color. And then is there a way - first of all, I mean there's discussion on paper prices and EBITDA and it does seem to catch investors by surprise. Can you just give us the number or in terms of percentage of EBITDA that paper is? Or what it is this quarter versus last quarter a year ago quarter? So that we could kind of gauge and not be surprised by stuff like that?
William Meaney: Yes, I think the paper prices are volatile. If you take a step back in the overall shred business, revenue was around $440 million, 4450 million a year. And about a third of that revenue comes from the sale of paper for recycling. And so that what's give you a majority of that close through. It doesn't flow through at 100%, but it flows through at probably 90% in the EBITDA. So that sort of where you get the volatility. If you take those numbers the paper prices can be really worried to last year. Again, it peaked in the second quarter last year. So Q1 we are actually stable Q1 was actually a tailwind for us this year. You too will be a headwind for us. So that gives you an idea what the magnitude of the scope of the businesses.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. That' sounds good. And if I could just sneak in one more. Just - and the acquisitions of customer relationship, is there a way for us to triangulate is to how much volume you contribute through those, like $33 million or $34 million this quarter? How much volume does that add to your organic volume when you make those? Is there like a per million dollars we add x amount of volume? Or how can we think about them more broadly?
Stuart Brown: In that number also includes things like service acquisitions, which could be in shred or other businesses. If you look at sort of historically and how we sort of look the normal pace of the businesses we typically pick up on an annualized basis about 3 million to 4 million cubic week per year through customer acquisitions, through acquisitions and customer contracts. And we've always included that organically because really the alternative is to go out and pay commissions to somebody else, which really, if it wasn't the commission lines, it sort of wouldn't be a question about it. We're not buying assets, we're not buying businesses. It's really acquiring customer contacts. And so that is sort of the other side of the coin.
Operator: The next question is from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities.
Karin Ford: I wanted to go back to expense topic again. It sounds like the March cost in the shred and the SG&A line, but you also saw a large increase in storage operating expenses, I think was up 7% year-over-year including a 24% increase in labor there as well. Are you seeing course pressures across the entire business or was there anything one-time in that in that line?
Stuart Brown: No, the other piece of the story sides have the change in the lease accounting year-over-year. So that impact to that as well. Nothing to call out. There's no sort of global labor pressures that we sort of see standing out that we expect.
William Meaney: Yes, no, if you kind of take, Karin, one more piece of color on that. If you take the two piece so we talked about $10 million that was unexpecting, these thing happens from time to time in the business. $10 million on a $1.5 billion or approaching $1.5 billion EBITDA business, this is not these things generally we catch them early in the quarter, we can manage them and these things happen from time to time. This one was just then you start getting into March, there's not a lot of time to recover. So that kind of one thing. The other product in terms of the increased SG&A, as Stuart said before, was actually planned is. Because if you want to get continuous improvement to pay for itself in year, we have to execute in the first quarter. So when the ramp up programs like this you generally see a frontload of the cost in Q1 into a certain degree of Q2. So that benefits. Now the good result is that we set this group up. And because they've actually week in our expectation when the set them up okay, let's go even harder going into Q2 on some of the programs that they keyed up in Q1, which means that at the end, you're not able to make the $10 million, which is as you say, is not the hardest thing and given the size of the business in 9 months to run. But it means stronger EBITDA margin exit rate when we go into 2020.
Stuart Brown: Okay. One of the things I forgot to mention on the other storage as well, you do have the impact year-over-year on the EvoSwitch acquisition, which has got from a higher facilities cost, obviously, and sort of the core part of the business as a percentage of revenue. So that is one of the drivers just the gross margin storage.
Karin Ford: Got it. That actually your answers segues into my next question, which - it just seems like kind of a quick turnaround on the expense side, given the complexity of the initiatives you laid out. What gives you confidence that you can achieve a 650 basis points margin swing, basically in three quarters?
William Meaney: It's actually not that - while I appreciate - I'm going to tell my board you have a very complex job I make sure I use that. Right now, it's not a complex as you see. The thing that is - first of all, the labor issue in shred, it is - it takes management. But the bottom line is if you are replacing over time with full time you have to manage the overtime people don't know where it's really been over time we didn't do that properly. There was a learning lesson for us because we don't do that that often. We actually run our place pretty efficiently, but many times overhead - overtime so edifies that we have to do this large hiring and then manage that out. So that we're able to reverse that very, very quickly. So now that we've been able to identify and put people on it. I think in terms of the SG&A, first of all, and that area is, as Stuart said, we actually brought consultants in to help build out the upstream, the global upstream and into initiate a number of those projects. So those are - that was planned cost to come in and come out. So that's actually already done and pretty straightforward. And then, the other area and some of the areas in terms of the get to what our global ops team have identified in Q1 and start initiating some of it was just global best practices on transportation. So we actually in any given day around the world the good thing about having transportation being a heavily demanded area is we have open racks or open positions in our pretty much globally and our transportation. And we're able to manage that cost out pretty quickly by just not feeling or canceling some of those openings as we bring productivity into our fleet. So that's one area. And the other area, which I don't think we did mention in our remarks, a big chunk of our improvement issue believe it or not coming is from procurement. We've done a pretty good job in speeding agility a few years ago and procurement. That was primarily focused in North America. And now we've actually given, with JB coming in as the Chief Operating Officer, we've expanded his - including procurement, and procurement now's a global exercise. So fairly straight, we're still, I would say, at the low hanging fruit stage. I'm sure it will get complex. I'll make sure I'll tell my Board that in the years to come. But right now, it's fairly straightforward.
Karin Ford: Great. And I'll just finish up with data center question. Can you give us an estimate of what you think the mark-to-market is going to on the 68% data center rent you have expiring over the next three years?
William Meaney: I think, overall, again, we - from a GAAP standpoint, right, we adjusted through the acquisition on IO and EvoSwitch, basically two market on GAAP basis. And we did both of those acquisitions, we found them pretty close to the markets. So we don't expect a big mark-to-market on the turnover.
Stuart Brown: Yes, I think the good about, Karin, is we're relatively new in the data center space. So it was a lot of - I think the question behind your question, there was a lot of price compression I think over the last 3 or 4 years. Our contract is still relatively new other than the mark-to-market during the acquisition. And when we look at our exposure in the hyperscale is still relatively small. We think that's an important segment and we continue to grow and look for ways to expand in that business. But our models are based where the prices have adjusted to now rather than us trying to hang on to business that was priced at higher historical pressures. We think pressing now it's pretty much leveling out to where the clearing price is based on the expected returns that underlie our sales should expect.
Operator: The next question is from Kevin McVeigh from Crédit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh: Billing or Stuart, is there anything in terms of revenue? I mean the organic growth came in at 1.9%. I think if you have it right, it's the easiest comp of the year and then the comps come and get more difficult. Is there anything that kind of comes in and helps that grow over factor. How should we think about that over the balance of 2019?
Stuart Brown: Kevin, this is Stuart. From a growth perspective year-over-year, I mean you get a little bit of lumpiness. But again, on the 700 million cubic week of volume, right, that we're storing for the customers that think paying every month. On the margin in the numbers you talked about on seasonal stand point of view are really small. So as I think Bill mentioned little bit better than we expected, both from destruction as well as in new sales from existing - new customers. And we've got to feel good about the problem that we have for the year. And so we're pretty much right along with her outlook.
Kevin McVeigh: Got it. And to your point to kind of have a wider range given the FX. At this point do you plan on become - would you think you're coming with the lower end of the range or the higher rent based on where we are in quarter into it?
Stuart Brown: I think the Rangers upper hand or both FX dependent, and I'll leave it at that.

In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in this supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Leo Meaney: Thank you, Greer, and thank you all for taking the time to join us. We’re pleased to be here this morning to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2018 performance. 2018 marked a year of continued strong growth for Iron Mountain highlighted by global storage organic revenue growth, significant growth in our data center business and further scale in our emerging markets. Turning to slide 3 of our financial results presentation, full year increased 10% which was in line with our expectations, driven in part by the contribution from recent data center acquisitions and strong growth and services. Notably total organic revenue growth was 3.6% for the full year, a strong acceleration from the 2.3% we reported in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was also in line with expectations growing 14% year-over-year and resulting in a 120 basis point improvement in our margin. Lastly, we generated 16% growth in AFFO at the high end of our expectations, whilst continuing to reinvest in the growth of our business and supporting our commitment to our dividend. The strong AFFO performance compares to an increase in our fully diluted shares outstanding of 7.4% and resulted in a 160 basis points reduction of our payout ratio to 78%. As it relates to our fourth quarter performance, we achieved constant currency revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% and 12% respectively, whilst our margin expanded a 100 basis points year-over-year. I’ll provide more detail around volume trends in a few minutes. When on a global organic basis Records Management volume was flat in 2018. Importantly, 2018 was a year of continued evolution for Iron Mountain. We made significant progress in increasing our mix to high growth businesses, completing more than $1.7 billion in targeted acquisitions. This evolution is highlighted by the ongoing expansion of our global data center footprint with the acquisitions of IO, the Credit Suisse Data Centers and EvoSwitch. We continue to also expand in faster growing emerging markets with acquisitions that increase scale and reach in key markets including South Korea, China and the Philippines. We continue to build from our strong capabilities and core competencies developed over many decades of managing our customers’ valuable physical and information assets to extend our storage capabilities beyond Records Management and Data Management to a more comprehensive portfolio of physical storage solutions. Today, we store many of our customers’ valuable assets in addition to information assets, which leverages our know how and utilizes our existing storage facilities and logistics expertise whilst maximizing our revenue in NOI per square foot. To this point, we made targeted acquisitions to further a number of our faster growing businesses, such as market leading Fine Arts and entertainment services capabilities and valley consumer storage. All of this enables us to help customers manage the storage of valuable assets beyond the more than 690 million cubic feet of records in digital information we store in our Records and Information Management or RIM business area. Turning to our business performance, Organic Records Management global volume was flat, a modest improvement from Q3 as new volume increased 10 basis points sequentially. More specifically in North America new volumes from existing customers and new sales together increased almost 40 basis points sequentially whilst destructions ticked up 10 basis points. In a few moments I’ll highlight some of the recent wins in North America Records and Information Management that have helped to support this performance. Volume in the emerging markets continues to grow at a faster clip increasing 7% for 2018 though we saw a modest tick down in new sales compared to Q3. Our investments are focused on increasing the scale of our businesses in these geographies and growing market share as evidenced by the recent acquisitions I highlighted earlier. Organic storage revenue growth increased 1.9% and 2.4% year-over-year in Q4 and 2018 respectively, as revenue management continues to contribute positively to growth. Destructions remain at elevated levels though we saw a moderation in recent trends. Organic service revenue growth was strong in 2018, growing at 5.4% driven in part by continued strength in Secure Shred as well as momentum in digital projects from our Information Governance and Digital Solutions business or IGDS. Overall, we had a successful Q4 with a number of strong new business wins across the North America RIM. Turning to slide 4, an example of one such win was a 5-year agreement with CitiMortgage, which was looking to outsource their non core business function within their mortgage workflows. Once successfully implemented, we expect to gain 550,000 cubic feet of records plus more than 820,000 files. Additionally, a new customer signed in Q4 was the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. The Hoover Institution has begun a major renovation of their facilities at Stanford, which will directly impact their archival collections located in three historic buildings. Most of their collections are moving off-site during the renovation some indefinitely and Iron Mountain was selected to relocate 64,000 cubic feet of material from Stanford University to a customized Iron Mountain facility. Specialized relocation processes designed by our team along with the Hoover archivists and preservationists will be utilized during the move. The collections will be maintained and circulated from our private climate controlled vault modified specifically for this project. This is a great example of our teams working to implement solutions to meet our customer specific needs. Turning to our federal business, we’ve made significant inroads and further penetrating this historically un-vended channel. Across our entire federal business revenue grew 14% year-over-year in 2018 led by strength in data center and Records Management. To this point, a U.S. government regulatory agency expanded with a new data center deployment in Northern Virginia adding to their existing deployment in New Jersey. On the Records Management side of the federal business we had net cube growth of 4% during 2018 and continued to see good momentum. We’re encouraged by the progress made in Q4 in North America and accelerating volume from existing customers and driving new business to Iron Mountain. Another area of solid progress in 2018 was the momentum of our IGDS business as customers increasingly live in a hybrid world of both physical and digital storage. We recently signed a contract with a large retailer to enhance our value adding services. We’re beginning a digital solution involving more than 75 million images of employee files, which are currently housed on premise at each individual store as part of an HR file conversion project. Digitizing HR documents and centralizing into a single repository helps achieve greater efficiency, reduce risk and improve compliance with a variety of federal and state requirements. We’re currently in discussions with this customer to assist them in extracting even greater value from their HR information through the use of our InSight platform and its machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. These are great examples of how we’re solving problems of our customers and adding value in the areas of digital transformation and compliance. We had an extremely active pipeline of opportunities for our IGDS business as we ended 2018, nearly 50% increase over the prior year. Importantly we’re seeing these opportunities increasingly translate into income as revenue is doubled over the past two years. Regarding our data center business on slide 5, you can see Q4 in 2018 performance was strong with full year revenue of nearly $230 million and adjusted EBITDA of a $100 million. We continue to see solid leasing momentum as we closed out Q4 achieving our targeted 10 megawatts of new and expansion leasing for the year consisting of 261 leases signed with strength in the financial services, professional services and federal vertical. Of those new and expansion leases 34% were new logos to our data center platform of which 43% had a pre-existing customer relationship with Iron Mountain reinforcing the strength of the Iron Mountain brand and its extension to our data center business. To that point, we signed a new cloud base provider of medical information in Northern Virginia as this customer was very sensitive to proximity to its own local IT team. Additionally, this customer also has a longstanding relationship with our Data Management team, so our core competencies and compliance and security resonated well with their data center needs. Another great example of a new customer is Wasabi Technologies, a hot cloud storage company, which deployed in Northern Virginia. Iron Mountain was able to fulfill all of their data center requirements including a hyper scale ready facility which meets the strict compliance requirements for Fed ramp. Demand from existing customers remain strong with a number of customers expanding their footprint in existing data centers as well as deploying with us in additional markets. A large global bank which came to us as a data center through the IO acquisition increased its capacity needs three times during 2018 expanding its usage in New Jersey by 47%. Turning to slide 6, our development pipeline reflects construction in key markets including New Jersey, Phoenix, London and Amsterdam as we continue to see good demand from existing customers. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, we acquired a part of the land in Frankfurt with power reserved in a permitted design which will ultimately support 20 megawatts of capacity. Frankfurt is the second largest multi-tenant data center market in Europe beyond London. This land acquisition improves our competitive position across Europe and allows us to have a presence in three of the four key European metro areas. We now have total potential capacity of almost 350 megawatts across our data center platform including the land in Frankfurt and Chicago. We expect the leasing momentum exiting 2018 will continue into 2019 as we build on our strength with enterprise customers and attract more hyper scale demand. We currently expect to be able to achieve robust leasing activity with a target of executing 15 to 20 megawatts of new and expansion signings in 2019. Turning to slide 7, our strong performance in 2018 has enhanced the solid foundation we’ve created and increased our financial strength as an organization to support sustained growth. Once our acquisitions from last year are fully incorporated in our base numbers, the business as it is configured today is expected to deliver 4% plus organic adjusted EBITDA growth going into 2020 well in line with our original 2020 plan to exit 2020 with a 5% organic EBITDA growth. This is all compared to less than 2% growth just five years ago. As it relates to our outlook for 2019, we issued guidance this morning which reflects consistent performance expectations for Records and Information Management business fundamental with further physical storage potential from newer adjacencies. Ongoing strong growth in emerging markets data center and adjacent businesses and continued investment in the business to support strategic initiatives and innovation around digital solutions to support our customers’ evolving needs. We do anticipate that the strong dollar will create headwinds over the course of 2019 relative to our reported results, though this has no operational or margin impact. On a constant currency basis we expect revenue growth of 3%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 4% and AFFO growth of 4.5%. And if we normalize for the impact of adoption of lease accounting our adjusted EBITDA margin would increase by a 100 basis points further. Stuart will have more detail on our 2019 guidance in a moment. Putting this all into historical context Iron Mountain is entering into 2019 in great shape. Our brand continues to resonate with our customer base where trust is ever more important especially when it comes to information as well as valued assets. This trusted relationship with more than 225,000 customers in covering over to 95% of the Fortune 1000 is demonstrated both by the continued relevance of our RIM business with expanding margins through higher pricing as well as the rapid growth of our digital solutions business and data center offerings. In terms of how our services have delivered bottom-line value is worth noting the accelerating growth of the business since 2014. We have grown revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis at a 10% CAGR. AFFO has delivered a 10.9% CAGR with a 7.8% CAGR in share count. Our business is more diversified both by business line as well as geography all yielding the acceleration in underlining growth mentioned earlier. All together over the past five years we have built significant momentum into the business and feel good going into the year. We will remain disciplined regarding the pace with which we deploy capital to support these growth initiatives, whilst ensuring we remain true to our financial model. With that I will turn the call over to Stuart.
Stuart Brown: Thank you, Bill and thank you all for joining our fourth quarter and 2018 results conference call. We delivered very strong AFFO growth in 2018 of 16% and continue to expand our adjusted EBITDA margins while also achieving 3.6% organic revenue growth. This growth was supported by results of our revenue management program and continued expansion of value add services and our data center platform with growth of records volumes in our international markets offsetting declines in North America. We are pleased with the healthy performance across our business segments as well as our progress investing in and integrating faster growing businesses. Not only do these new businesses create value for shareholders, but also allow us to be better partner with our customers for their critical physical and digital storage needs. I'd like to start off the financial discussion with the performance highlights which you can see on slides 8 and 9 of the presentation. For the quarter revenue was in line with expectations approaching $1.1 billion growing about 7% on a reported basis then almost 10% on a constant currency basis. This is driven by contributions from our recent data center acquisitions and strong organic revenue growth including solid contributions from our emerging markets in our businesses. Total organic revenue grew by 3.5% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and 3.6% for the full year. Organic storage revenue grew 1.9% for the quarter and 2.4% or by $60 million for the full year. Organic service revenue grew 6.1% in the fourth quarter and by 5.4% for the full-year. Service growth was primarily driven by increased contributions from our expanding Secure Shred business, continued strength and recycled paper prices as well as additional digitization and special projects. Our adjusted EBITDA grew over 12% on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter to $360 million with margins expanding 100 basis points year-over-year to 33.9%. The margin improvement resulted primarily from the flow through of revenue management, the impact of the adoption of the revenue recognition standard and improved labor productivity. SG&A as a percentage of revenue excluding significant acquisition costs declined about 80 basis points in the fourth quarter versus a year ago due in part to lower bad debt expense and increased operating leverage on the revenue growth. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.25 per share down from 2017 due mostly to higher depreciation and amortization associated with data center acquisitions and impacted by a 6% increase in shares outstanding following our December 2017 offering to fund the acquisition of I/O data centers. For the full year AFFO was $874 million up $122 million or 16% over the prior year reflecting the strong operating performance of our data center acquisitions in a very disciplined approach to capital allocation while continuing our investments in new products and businesses. AFFO came in at the high end of our expectations due to lower cash taxes and interest as well as slightly lower capital spending. To touch on operating performance in more detail, on slide 10 you can see developed markets organic storage revenue growth came in at 0.9% for the quarter slightly better than Q3 and 1.4% for the full year despite the negative volume growth again reflecting the contribution from revenue management. Organic service revenue in developed markets increased 5.1% for the quarter and 5.2% percent for the full year due mainly to growth in our shred business, project revenue and digitization projects as mentioned earlier. In other international, we continued to see healthy organic storage revenue growth of 4.1% for the quarter. Full-year organic storage revenue growth was 5.4% and 3.2% growth in organic volume. Organic service revenue growth was 6.1% in the quarter and 5% for the full year in this segment. Further the data center business delivered strong organic revenue growth of 12% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. Our adjacent businesses also performed well with revenue growth growing almost 19% on an organic basis in the quarter and nearly 11% for the full year. Turning to slide 11, you can see the detail of our fourth quarter 100 basis point adjusted margin expansion with growth in most segments. We saw a margin decline in North America data management or our tape business driven by lower volumes and mix as well as investments made in growing new products and services. In the tape storage business the amount of digital data being stored continues to grow, however, greater physical tape density is resulting in lower physical volumes. Revenue management has helped offset some of the tape volume trends and margins have remained north of 50%. In Western Europe fourth quarter margin expansion returned to levels seen in the first half of the year expanding by 240 basis points reflecting lower bad debt, our focus on continuous improvement and stronger project based revenue in the UK, Germany, and Austria. In the global data center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins were 41.5% in the fourth quarter and 43.5% for the full year reflecting the increased scale of the business and progress on integration activity. As Bill noted, we are pleased with our leasing activity reflecting the successful integration of a strong commercial team and demand in the markets where we operate. During the quarter we executed 3.3 megawatts of new and expansion leasing for total 9.6 megawatts for the year. The leasing was primarily enterprise in Federal Government customers in churn remains quite manageable at 3.2% in 2018. Turning to slide 12, you can see that our lease adjusted leverage ratio at the end of the year was 5.6 times comfortably in line with other rates especially when considering that our business is more durable than many other REIT sectors, but we did not have any significant financing activity in the fourth quarter, we did sell two properties as part of our capital recycling program which generated net proceeds of $56 million. As of December 31, our borrowings were 73% fixed-rate, our weighted average borrowing rate was 4.9% and our well-laddered maturity average is 6.2 years with no significant maturities until 2023. Our strong balance sheet and capital structure is supported by our significant real estate portfolio and long term nature of our customer relationships. Turning to guidance this is detailed in the supplemental for your review and on slide 13. We’re expecting 2019 revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.08 to a $1.18 and AFFO to be in the range of $870 million to $930 million. This reflects solid performance following 2018’s growth impacted by a stronger dollar, new lease accounting standard and continuing investments in our Insight IT infrastructure and our data center pipeline. 2019 total organic revenue growth is expected to be in a range of 2% to 2.5% including organic storage revenue growth of 1.75% to 2.5%. Global organic record volumes are expected to be flat with declines in North America offset by growth in other international markets. Globally we expect new incoming volume to continue offsetting destruction rates of 4.5% to 5% and outperms of around 2%. We expect service organic growth will be the low single digits for 2019 from continued growth in our shred business and information governance in digital solutions. As many of you know, record recycle paper prices were tailwind to our service business in 2018, but we anticipate moderating paper prices in 2019. We also expect continued strong growth in the data center business with low teens organic revenue growth compared to 2018. We will though have elevated churn in the first quarter in Phoenix due to two customer move outs that were part of our deal underwriting when we acquired IO. Anticipated investments which are detailed in the supplemental will be funded by a combination of cash available from operations, capital recycling and new borrowings supported by the higher expected adjusted EBITDA. We may also utilize third party capital particularly for data center development and equity from our ATM depending on market conditions. We expect our lease adjusted leverage ratio to improve 10 to 20 basis points from the 5.6 times at the end of 2018. As we think about 2019 outlook there are several factors affecting comparability that I would like to bring to your attention. First we divested our fulfillment business at the end of Q3, 2018 which generated approximately 25 million in annualized revenue. Second, the adoption of the new leasing standard is expected to result in a non-cash increase in rent expense of $10 million to $15 million, lower interest expense of $3 million and lower depreciation expense of about $3 million due primarily to certain capital leases converting to operating leases under the standard. Third, current foreign exchange rates relative to 2018 are expected to result in a $60 million to $70 million headwind to revenue and $20 million to $25 million impact to EBITDA. As a reminder on FX, we derive about 40% of our revenue from non U.S. dollar currencies and as a result exchange rate volatility can't have a significant impact on our reported results. Well, we have very low transactional exposure with our costs well matched to our revenue in the respective countries, we do have un-hedged translation exposure and somewhat higher proportion of our debt is U.S. dollar denominated. As the business continues to evolve with data center growth, we will also be reviewing our disclosure to determine where we can make changes to reduce complexity and enhance transparency. You should expect to see some changes to the supplemental beginning in the first quarter. In summary, as we close out another year of continued growth and evolution we are pleased to see progress on multiple fronts. Our records and information management business continues to deliver durable cash flow and steady organic revenue growth through solid revenue management. We've had continued success extending into higher growth in emerging markets and our fast-growing data center business and adjacent businesses continue to increase scale and have become very competitive platforms poised for even greater success. We are pleased with the adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and dividend growth rates achieved in 2018 and the contributions from our team serving customers around the world and look forward to strong performance again in 2019. With that I will turn over the call to Bill for closing remarks before we open up for Q&A.
William Leo Meaney: Thank you, Stuart. And just a couple of comments before we begin the question and answer is, first of all, it was a very strong year, which was punctuated by double-digit EBITDA and AFFO growth well ahead of the shares we issued to support our acquisition of the IO data center. The business also has never been stronger or better positioned, continued organic storage revenue growth with remaining untapped storage segments or reserves, a broader range of businesses and services still tied to our existing business relationships built on decades of trust and accelerating organic growth of EBITDA and AFFO which underpins future dividend growth whilst de-levering. With that operator I'd like to open it up to questions.
Operator: Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Nathan Crossett with Berenberg. 
Nathan Crossett: Hi, good morning. Maybe you can just talk a bit about your appetite for further data center acquisitions. I know you have plenty of room to build out based on the current pipeline. But wanted to get your thoughts on just outright acquisitions. Is it possible to see some more EvoSwitch type transactions going forward?
William Leo Meaney: Good morning, Nate. Look I wouldn't rule it out but it's not really what we think we need to do in the plan. In other words the EvoSwitch, if you think about EvoSwitch specifically which as a good example is we look at the top 10 international markets and the top 10 U.S. markets and we say okay, do we feel, how do we prioritize those, which ones do we think we should enter. And then, when we look at that is, we look at what's the best way to enter that market. So Chicago, Northern Virginia and Frankfurt are all great examples where we decided the best way for us to enter that because it's important for our customers that we have decades of relationship with, plus some of our newer customers on the data center side that we have product on the shelf in those key markets and we decided the best way to enter those markets was through Greenfield development which we've done. In Amsterdam, we looked at the same thing because as you know, in Europe we refer many times to the flat markets, the top markets in Europe are Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Paris. So Amsterdam is absolutely a key market in Europe and it's one that our customers wanted to see us in. and when we looked at Amsterdam, quite frankly EvoSwitch for us was the best entry point. So, that's how we think about those markets but if you think about overall in terms of our growth plan, we're now almost 350 megawatts of capacity that we can build out both with sites that we've already started building in the Frankfurt in Chicago site and we feel really good about being able to achieve our financial plan with little or no acquisitions.
Nathan Crossett: Thanks, that's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up, can you talk a bit about this datacenter competition. We've heard from some of the wholesale providers that price can be very competitive in certain markets. So, I'm just curious to hear your thoughts and maybe you could talk a bit about how you're trying to differentiate?
Stuart Brown: I think it's a good question, Nate. I think that well first of all I would differentiate between the enterprise customers in a hyper scale. So, it's fair to say right now, we as Iron Mountain is we're more the bulk of our customers are in the enterprise segment which is what you would expect. We notice that of the new logo who signed this year, 43% of them we already had an existing customer relationship, where then obviously those were enterprise customers. So, for us I think when you talk about pricing, we see less price sensitivity on the enterprise side quite frankly. So, Iron Mountain hasn’t been exposed to that as much. When you see the analyst talking about the pricing compression, it's more on the hyper scale. Now, what does that mean for us is we do have an appetite to be present in the hyper scale market and I think I've covered this before on the calls and it's more about getting to optimize in the yield on the site. So, if you look at Northern Virginia which is 82 acres and can build out well north of 80 megawatts of critical IT load. Then if you want to fill that, the rate that you fill it is it's important in some ways as what the specific revenue per kilowatt that you're getting on that site. So, to fill that out at a pace that we think is optimum, then we would expect that site to be somewhere at when it's fully built out between 40% to 60% hyper scale. Now, on our standpoint is our models are built on current hyper scale pricing. So, I think what you're hearing coming out of the industry is hyper scale pricing has come down and quite frankly these things typically are kind of 8% to 9% cash-on-cash returns. They are at least approaching that level now but that's where we built our model and that's where we expect our entry point, which are still well above our weighted average cost of capital and it's still a good return. So, I think the noise coming out of the market I think is more about people who have been heavily present in that segment before and they're realizing the pricing is coming down to what I would call the normal clearing price in terms of what a reasonable return is for these very large scale projects which have very long contract duration.
Nathan Crossett: That's helpful, thanks. I'll get back in line.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore.
Sheila McGrath: Yes, good morning. Your EBITDA margins in 2018 continue to improve, just wondering what your outlook for merging improvement is in 2019. Is it achievable to maintain or grow margin in North America in storage. And how is the mix shifting to datacenters driving margin improvement?
Stuart Brown: Yes, hi. Good morning, Sheila, this is Stuart. Just if you look at sort of the midpoint in guidance implies about a 30 basis point improvement in margin and as Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks where that's impacted also negatively by the change in lease accountings if you normalize for that it's a 50 basis points to a 100 basis point margin expansion. And I think you're going to see similar trends in '19 to what you saw in '18 with revenue management continuing to contribute to margin expansion in the developed markets. Emerging markets, you'll see some margin expansion really due to continue in increased scale because we're not we've got pricing program in those market but we're really there focused on driving scale and continuing to increase our market presence. And then you will get then in the datacenter business or that business grows as a percentage of the total business. You will get some uplift in margins because that business is higher average EBITDA margin than the rest of the business.
Sheila McGrath: And as a follow-up, Bill you mentioned the federal vertical records growth of 4% in 2018. Just wondering how that backlog is looking in 2019 and any insights on how meaningful that opportunity might be?
William Meaney: No, thanks Sheila. No, I think that we expect to continue to build on that, obviously it's with the federal government the gestation period of it is longer than our say normal private enterprise customers. But we continue to see the backlog growing and I think we highlighted our homeland security win on the last call. And we start getting those what I call kind of an iconic brand is the momentum that's starting to build in the business. And we see that, we see an acceleration in terms of the pipeline. With that being said is that the government is one fiscal budget. So, you work this year to deliver the project generally for next year. But we really like what we see in the pipeline in terms of momentum. So, I would expect that to tick up over time.
Sheila McGrath: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Hi thanks, good morning. You are now several years into your revenue management initiative. Can you provide us with an update on the roll out of revenue management across your geographies and the amount of pricing benefit you expect through 2020?
Stuart Brown: Yes, good morning George. So, first of all in terms of the program is that it's pretty much completely rolled out obviously in North America and now Western Europe. We start rolling it out this year or past last year in 2018 with four centers across the broader international market out beyond Western Europe. So, we expect to see some real traction in those markets whereas Western Europe will be fully online this year, last year was partially online, obviously North America will continue online. So, what we expect is similar levels of price increase in North America. In Europe as we while in North America is we got this past year, we expect an uptick on coming out of Europe and also the emerging markets, and so the international markets this year. So, we feel pretty good in terms of the momentum that we're getting on that. So, I think you can expect that we'll have further strength from price in revenue management coming in to 2019 and we built that into our guidance.
George Tong: Got it, that's helpful. And on margins, we essentially achieved all your targeted transformation savings and recall cost synergies to the end of 2018. Can you remind us of your 2020 EBITDA margin target taking into account the lease accounting changes and discuss some of the initiatives you have to bridge from your current margins to 2020 margins?
Stuart Brown: Yes, I mean if we normalize for the impact of the lease accounting and even if we go back which to normalize actually for the rev rec accounting that we had that helped us in 2018, while we've been achieving margin expansion of 50 basis points to a 100 basis points a year. Looking forward, right investment benefit also by the obviously the flow through of rev rec as well as synergies, we continue to have cost improvement programs in place that you will continue to see benefit from going forward. So, we expect to see sort of similar levels of margin expansion going forward. But in addition, we've historically been investing $20 million to $30 million a year in our new business growth and new business initiatives and starting to see some green shoots come out of those businesses. And as you look forward, we expect to see some margin expansion that coming out of those business as well. So, I think as you look forward, feel quite comfortable with sort of continuing a similar track of a margin expansion.
George Tong: Got it, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And then the next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird & Company.
Andrew Wittmann: Yes, great. I guess my question kind of builds on the last question here. Just want to understand some of the moving parts of -- I know the long-term guidance to 2020 that you gave. As talked to obviously multi -- your look is going to have lots of puts and takes as things change over the years. But maybe just to start out level side us. Stuart, can you talk about can you quantify the FX headwind that the target is seeing to revenue and EBITDA, so we could kind of really look on it as on the 2019 currency rates. And I mean it looks like you need to find something like I don’t know exactly what the FX it is but double-digit EPS growth or EBITDA growth into next year in margin increases '20 over '19 of a 200 basis points or so. So, can you just talk about some on the puts and takes in a little bit more detail and achieving that 2020 guidance and how you feel about the key matrix of revenue and EBITDA specifically?
Stuart Brown: Yes. I'm glad you asked the question. Again, and today we're really focused on the 2019 guidance. So, we didn’t want to sort of confuse that with sort of putting out 2020 numbers. So, let me walk you through the puts and takes to how to get there. And to answer your first question on the currency, if you go back to my script, we talked about in 2019, FX headwinds by itself on revenue were $60 million to $70 million on an EBITDA or $20 million to $25 million. And --.
Andrew Wittmann: Can you give that cumulative business beginning now just so we can kind of compare more easily, do you have that handy for each one?
Stuart Brown: I don’t have that handy. Again, the exchange rates prior to sort of the recent changes haven’t been that significant, so we go back to what our 2020 plan has been. This is now really the biggest impact. And yes, remember the 2020 plan was built on currency rates at a certain period of time. So, you should, we should always be normalizing for FX when it goes up or down.
Andrew Wittmann: Right.
Stuart Brown: So, but if you look forward and relative to our last 2020 plan, right, you can see that we've delivered right on track for 2018 to get to the 2020 plan adjusted for FX from 2018 reported results, EBITDA would need to grow about 15% or $200 million to get to the range of the 2020 numbers. So, when you think about you got about 4% organic EBITDA growth per year, so that adds in and of itself run a $120 million, continue to expect in our long-term plan, continue to expect a 150, actually a $150 million plus of M&A per year. So, that $300 million total M&A, that would add about another $50 million of EBITDA and anything about the comments I just made around, we've been investing in new businesses and services about $30 million per year. So, those should start to deliver EBITDA growth as well combined with savings from continuous improvement can get you back into that range for what our longer term models were. We will, at some point be issuing sort of new long-term growth targets in the future. We're looking at sort of when the best time is to do that now.
William Meaney: And the only thing I would just add Andy on this is that from a FX standpoint is that in our view as we take FX right and the good news is we don’t have a margin exposure on that. So, whether it gives us a tailwind which it did a couple of years ago and now it's giving us headwinds is what your where our shareholders are paying for us to do is to manage the business through those tailwinds and headwinds. So, we're really focused on line-of-sight to the operational plan that we have to do to deliver that original 2020 guidance and we're well on track with that. And we think the looking at some of the R&D pipeline that Stuart relayed, mentioned the $30 million that we're spending roughly a year on that that includes things like Iron Cloud and InSight which we effectively have seen very little benefit to date on. So, we feel pretty good in terms of where we stand versus our original outline.
Andrew Wittmann: Great, that's helpful. And then, just kind of a cleanup question here. On the AFFO for the year you guys came in and better how you mentioned. I think it's just some taxes but the thing you control most here is the CapEx side. Is that a delay of some plan to CapEx and that we're going to see in the future or have you been able to manage the business so that the CapEx is altogether and needed?
Stuart Brown: Let me just give you a quick example of one of the big drivers of CapEx improvement. I can't remember if I talked with this on the last call or not. But if you look at that what we spend annually on our fleets for example, a few years ago our operation seemed to do a great job putting in place new management tools for our drivers to improve fuel utilization; reduce wear and tear on the trucks. As we've gone back now and reevaluated the impact to that, we've realized that the quality of our trucks and the time that they can stay on the road is increased. So, we've been able to actually reduce the rate at which we replace trucks annually and goes around $15 million or $20 million of capital saving in and of itself this year.
Andrew Wittmann: I understand, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with J.P.M.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is Michael Cho for Andrew. My first question, just a quick clarification. Should we still assume the previously stated 2020 plans has not changed, that's right. I know you mentioned new long-term growth targets are coming but you're referring to something past 2020, right?
Stuart Brown: Yes, we will. I mean again, we want to keep those long-term targets out there and if you look at there what we've been talked about in the past in terms of growth rates of a dividend, how do we support that with AFFO and EBITDA, those general trends all remain on track. And we think our current business plan support those. And the only thing that we'd say, the only thing you need to make sure that you're doing is when you're looking at 2020 is first of all is to make sure that you're looking at the FX impact to that and adjusting those targets for that. We're not issuing 2020 guidance today.
William Meaney: But I make you a point is that the walk that Stuart just took Andy through. Since that we're still on the 2020 number correcting for the 5% at the end of 2020. So, what we expect that the momentum will continue to build in the business. So, exiting '20 we're sitting here at a little over 4% organic EBITDA growth as we sit here today which we think is really great progress because we started as you can find the story as we started less than 2% four or five years ago. So, we've got that up to a little bit north of 4% on an organic basis and we have lined aside in on track to exit 2020 at 5% organic EBITDA growth.
Stuart Brown: I had one other point as well, just that people don’t think we sort of walking back as on our leverage target as well, right, the original multi-year plan we've got in there either five times lease adjusted EBITDA if we issue the full 80m or 5.2 times target for the end of 2020 and that remains our target as well on our business plan.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you. That's helpful. And just one quick on the datacenter side. You mentioned now that book digits organic revenue growth outlook for 2019. Can you give a quick comment on EBITDA contribution as well?
William Meaney: Go on, I'm sorry.
Unidentified Analyst: EBITDA, on datacenter.
Stuart Brown: Yes. So, I mean the EBITDA on the datacenter, we're sitting right now with the at the mid-40% range on the EBITDA margin. As that scale continues to grow, EBITDA numbers still sort of putting the infrastructure together from an integration standpoint. And also still incurring integration cost, we had a little over $2 million of integration cost in 2018. So, we're well in track to sort of getting back to the mid-50 margin and a 10% of total EBITDA by the end of 2020.
Unidentified Analyst: Understood, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from MaryAnn Bartels from Merrill Lynch.
MaryAnn Bartels: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Most of my questions have been answered but I just wanted a clarification. So, on the leverage target, you said you would get down about 20 basis points the 5.2 time. So, I'm sorry can you clarify why that's not the five plus five times?
Stuart Brown: So, the 10 basis point to 20 basis points to expansion is or improvement is in 2019 rowed up to the 5.6 at the end of 2019. So, we'll get down to 5.0 -- 5.4 at the end of 2019 and then another improvement in 2020.
William Meaney: And I think to your point about the difference between the 5.2 and the 5.0, it's whether we run the ATM. So, as you know we have a $500 million ATM which we've draw down a little over a 60 million off. So, and we haven’t run that for over a year now. If we ran that, that would reduce the leverage by 0.2, if we don’t run the ATM, then instead of 5.0 it would be 5.2; would be the endpoint for 2020.
MaryAnn Bartels: Got it. And is there a longer term target that you think is ideal for the business but how are we to, so?
Stuart Brown: I think what we've always said is that to us it's not about our ability to run the business or finance the business. And you could see that when we issue debt it's usually at the upper end of investment grade as it stands today. It's more where our covenants cut in. so, our covenants are at 6.5 and we think that ideally we would like 1.5 to 2.0 turns of daylight between wherever our covenants are and where our leverage is. Because it just gives us much more flexibility, whether it's looking at our own stock from time to time or if it's looking at opportunistic acquisitions, we just think that 1.5 to 2.0 turns between your covenants and where your debt levels are as ideal. So, we're not in a rush, that's why we our view is the right balance again from capital allocation as we continue to invest in growth in the business. We continue to grow the dividend and that still leaves us enough leftover that we can slowly tick down leverage to the targets that we set for ourselves. And over time that will continue to go down.
MaryAnn Bartels: Great. And then just lastly, in terms of how high you would go for the right datacenter or acquisition or any thoughts on that?
Stuart Brown: Well, it's really hard to talk about hypotheticals. We because look at we really like our plan. Obviously the area where the biggest demand for CapEx, don’t forget we have a 150 million of M&A built into the plan annually and another 250 million plus built in terms of expanding datacenters. So, it's not like we're constraining the business for capital. So, you put those two together, we got over $400 million that we're ploughing into growth and M&A for the business each year. So, and then if you said that we -- just in datacenter being the one that is probably the most obvious, is we with what we have in terms of Greenfield and sites that we've already started developing is we can take that to over to almost 350 megawatts. So, we got plenty of daylight in our plans, so it's really hard to respond to a hypothetical at this point.
MaryAnn Bartels: Great. Well, thank you for taking my question.
Stuart Brown: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.
Karin Ford: Well hi, good morning. I wanted to see if can get a little bit more detail on the assumptions underlying the 1.75% to 2.5% organic storage revenue growth forecast. I think you said in your comments that you think volumes to be flat. Does the low-end of the range accommodate volume declines at all and what do you think is going to be the primary driver of the acceleration from the 1.9 you printed in the fourth quarter to 2.1% at the midpoint?
Stuart Brown: No. Good morning, Karin, this is Stuart. I think if you look at sort of the trends that we had overall, you get some variability from quarter-to-quarter and you got to remember our volume numbers is our trailing four quarters. So, when you get around to the end of the year, you're looking at total volume changes by market is what we put in the supplemental and you also then can come back into sort of implied price. If you look at sort of the buildup in the number and you look at developed markets and emerging markets both volume and pricing, actually don’t expect to see that much difference in trends in 2019 from 2018. So, we've talked about revenue management and our ups continue to upside in that program. And if you think about sort of what those are, it's not really pricing consistent with inflations, so we're not out there doing anything too crazy on that front. You will get some tick down from organic revenue growth in the data management business; we talked about that as well. And then, that will be offset by continued growth in the datacenter in the adjacent businesses where you're getting storage and service growth on both of those. Albeit in 2019, the data center cooler base or organic base will grow as the acquisition sort of move in to as we lap over the acquisition dates. So, I think very comfortable with the growth rates that we've put out there.
Karin Ford: Thanks. Second question is where are EBITDA multiples on business acquisitions today and where are cap rates on real-estate acquisitions today?
Stuart Brown: We haven’t really done a lot of real-estate acquisitions today in that sense. I mean, the real-estate purchases that we've done are really opportunistic and it's more we've done some -- we will do some real-estate acquisitions in 2019 where we've got a couple of purchase options. Actually in California in a couple of record center that are well below market and that's in our plan will fund that with capital recycling from selling some other real-estate which is also in our plan. So, we'll continue to recycle capital opportunistically. If you look at sort of where multiples are creating in the business from a multiple of revenue basis and again we try to look at it actually including integration cost and things like that and we're still sitting sort of 3% to 3.5% shred, actually quite a bit little bit cheaper than that. And as a multiple of EBITDA six to seven times EBITDA and that's pre-synergies. So, our synergies will add another turn or so improvement on to those numbers.
Karin Ford: On the capital recycling front, what's the spread do you think between dispositions and acquisitions this year?
Stuart Brown: As we talked about in the past sort of in the -- the spreads are -- you'll see the gains, we saw the gains actually that we recorded in the P&L in the fourth quarter from some real-estate sales. And we'll you'll see some nice numbers next year as well. I mean, cap rates on industrial real-estate and we did some evaluation work with the east still last year. You look at the real-estate portfolio that we own in just North America is for the excluding racking before racking is about $2.5 billion and that's on a six cap rate. I'd argue cap rates are actually probably below that given the markets that we're in. and we would primarily end-markets like Boston, New Jersey, California, Chicago, Dallas, we really try to own in the primary markets. And you'll actually see a selling, actually the real-estate we're going to sell or recycle is going to be more the secondary and tertiary markets.
Karin Ford: Great. And then, just last question just a technical one on Page 7 of the slides. You show that the growth portfolio moves from about 19% of the revenue mix to 25% from the third quarter and fourth quarter. Was it just a reclassification or why that number moves so much?
Stuart Brown: That's more of a pro-forma just because we're lapping the IO EvoSwitch in Credit Suisse datacenter acquisitions. So, we were quite busy in 2018 and if you actually once those are all lapped, we're sitting at a 75/25 mix today.
Karin Ford: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the next question is a follow-up from Nate Crossett with Berenberg.
Nathan Crossett: Hi. I just wanted to ask about investment grade potential. I'm just curious to hear about any in our recent conversations with the rating agencies and how they are viewing the data center build out. And the reason I asked is because DLR has similar leverage levels and they have investment grades. So, --.
Stuart Brown: You just say that to make me jealous, don’t you Nate?
Nathan Crossett: No. just give me a sense -- I feel like, good.
Stuart Brown: No, it's I can look at a number of my peers across the REIT sector they have similar leverage levels and in better ratings that we do. We've been having ongoing discussions with both S&P and Moody's in a very healthy way, as our business had shifted from historically business services we became a REIT. We're continuing grow the datacenter business. I think Moody's actually has put out a report and published that we've moved over to their REIT team and so I think we're making good progress, we're having great dialogue with them. And I think they over time will give us more credit for the REIT like durability of the cash flow that comes out of the business.
William Meaney: And the only thing I would just add to that to Nate is that we've done like totally -- we're both focused that we would love to be treated like digital. The other part for us is we still want to de-lever because of this free space that we have where our covenants, our covenants are set at 6.5 why that's historical but that is what it is. One thing I would say is we're already getting kind of upper end of investment grade pricing when we go out and issue debt. So, we're already getting the benefit, it's just that rating agency is just all rated that way. So, you actually see our debt get priced is we're not far off but it would be nice to have the rating as well.
Stuart Brown: Yes. Our debt investors give us credit for the strength in the balance sheet and cash flow.
Nathan Crossett: That's helpful, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question also is a follow-up from Sheila McGrath with Evercore.
Sheila McGrath: Yes, I was wondering given your storage locations in North America are close to many major metropolitan areas and you have the trucking and logistics expertise. I'm wondering if there is a way to capture some additional demand for your storage base from last mile demand or is that what flex the industrial company that you've referenced before, is that kind of a last mile offering?
William Meaney: That's a great question, Sheila. So, it's kind of I would say three things that and I kind of highlighted it and will try to incorporate that so the people can see the total volume that we're storing rather than just purely the records information; the 690 million cubic feet of records that we are storing, doesn't include these things that we're already doing like under the flex program which is exactly which has similar margins by the way or revenue per square foot as our core business. We also have a similar type of operation in Amsterdam where we're doing both last mile customs and delivery for a number of the large global e-commerce platform just well as local post European postal offices. And the third area which I also alluded to is and we've talked about a few times is that we continue to like certain aspects of the Wallet consumer storage which is a logistics heavy portion of the consumer storage market. So, we think those three areas are areas that will continue to add volume to our network. And we our intention is to be able to incorporate that in the number, so you see it because right now it's hard to actually see the level of impact.
Stuart Brown: The thing I'll just add on quickly to, and when you think about how do we leverage our real-estate and locations, our logistics know how our asset tracking. And you can really see it in our Art business as well and entertainment services where we're doing a lot of specialized transport packing tracking of unique items and a number of the major auction houses have outsourced their back office to us for us to handle that for them. So, how do we keep expanding that and growing that, we think that's an interesting area.
Sheila McGrath: Great. And if you could quickly comment on the pre-leased development pipeline and datacenters moved up especially in New Jersey, just comment on the leasing activity there?
Stuart Brown: Yes. Now, let me again, we had a strong fourth quarter leasing activity. We're a little over a 20% pre-leased in the development pipeline. And as Bill mentioned, we had a large global bank take additional space at that location and we continue to see good leasing pipeline in almost all of our markets.
Sheila McGrath: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Yugo Weiwei [ph] with JP Morgan.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Good morning. I had a follow-up question on that investment rate question that was just asked. As on the financial policy perspective, do you want to be investment grade or are you working towards becoming an investment creative company?
William Leo Meaney: What I would tell you is that unfortunately I don't control the ratings. The rating agencies do. I mean we want to operate the business a heading in a direction that we think is prudent for us to be able to continue to grow and run the business. But I wouldn't say that there's something that we're aspire to. We want to keep those types of metrics, but it'll be up to the rating agency to figure out what they do.
Unidentified Analyst: So from the company's perspective respective of what the rating agency says you're sort of not managing the balance sheet to become of investment grade. You want to remain in high yield.
William Leo Meaney: I think yes, I would say we want to manage our balance sheet consistent with they being able to fund a business and not that different than other REITs and if you look at their balance sheet structure I think we're pretty close to that today.
Unidentified Analyst: And then sort of the lease versus owned mix, are the agencies I think in the past have had an issue with that as a way to compare to other REITs lease versus owned is that still an issue from their perspective or have they moved on?
William Leo Meaney: I would say first of all, let me refer you back I think it was the May REIT presentation that's on our website from last fall where we disclosed some of the valuation of our real estate in a little bit more detail. We've done that a couple of times and obviously we shared that with the rating agencies as well and so there's some detail in there. The important point here is that you have to look at it on a percentage of value versus a percentage of square feet. So while it looks like we own 30% of our overall square feet if you look at it from a valuation perspective the markets that we own or the markets you want to be in and control real estate so from a valuation perspective we're over 50%.
Unidentified Analyst: And are the agencies come around to that way of thinking you think? 
William Leo Meaney: I think the Moody's changing the ratings team is maybe a sign of that.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you very much. That's all I had.
William Leo Meaney: Great, thank you.

William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Greer, and hello, everyone. Before I begin, I first wish to welcome Greer to Iron Mountain in her role leading Investor Relations. Finding someone who has the skills, experience, and reputation to replace Melissa wasn't easy. We therefore felt very fortunate when we found that person in Greer. So, welcome, Greer. We're very pleased you are here. To Melissa, who'll be retiring at the end of the year, I wish to take a moment to thank you as this will be your last earnings call. And Melissa, as you know, started at Iron Mountain the same time as me. And it is impossible today to thank her appropriately. But I do wish to mention that we will be eternally grateful for all she has done doing a superb job leading not only our IR function, but much of our communications as well over the last six years. She has done all this against a backdrop of the company executing an agenda, delivering significant growth to our business, which has been transformative. Thank you, Melissa. I don't know how we would have done this without you. Now, moving on to the quarter. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of financial performance coupled with marked progress and our strategic plan as articulated four years ago designed to support the shift in our business mix. Our plan revolves around three pillars: getting more out of our developed markets in terms of yielding cash flow, expanding our Records Management model in the faster-growing emerging markets, and building on our strong customer relationships with 950 of the Fortune 1000 coupled with our know-how in order to expand into adjacent business areas. To this end, we are very pleased by our progress across these three pillars. A few proof points of this can be readily illustrated at a high level. We continue to maximize yield from Records Management in developed markets with adjusted EBITDA margin in North America RIM now over 46% with growing internal revenue, albeit on lower volumes. We achieved internal service revenue growth of 7%, which is a result of growth in Shred in business areas such as Information Governance and Digital Solutions or IGDS. We progressed towards our goal in making Records Management in the faster growing emerging markets, a bigger part of our mix where these markets represent 18% of our revenue whilst continuing to improve EBITDAR margins which are now over 30%. And we advanced the expansion of our data center business, which even at this early stage is now making a marked impact on our EBITDA and AFFO growth given it is now more than 8% of our adjusted EBITDA and is already expected to contribute 100 to 200 basis points of adjusted EBITDA growth on a consolidated basis. All told, the consistent delivery against our strategic goals has continued to drive strong growth in profitability as measured by year-over-year expansion in both gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin supporting healthy cash flow generation to fund our business investments whilst also reducing leverage over time. As a result, this morning, we announced a 4% increase in our quarterly dividend per share in line with our 2020 plan. This is supported by our year-to-date AFFO growth of 13.7%, which is well in excess of our 8% increase in share count. For the full year, our AFFO payout ratio is expected to be sub-80% versus our original guidance midpoint of 81% even after increasing the dividend. Our third quarter performance outlined on page 3 of the presentation is highlighted by total revenue growth of 12% on a constant dollar basis, solid growth in adjusted EBITDA with an 80 basis point increase in EBITDA margins, continued durability of our storage business with total internal revenue growth of 2.3%, strong internal service revenue growth of 7.1% for the quarter, good progress on integrating our data center acquisitions illustrated by strong data center portfolio utilization of 91.1% and continued organic expansion of our global data center platform, through internal development including breaking ground on our second phase of capacity in Phoenix and entering into a development agreement in Chicago, a top 5 U.S. market. In addition, we continue to achieve total internal revenue growth across all markets supported by internal storage revenue growth and strong internal service revenue growth. We also continue to focus on optimizing both utilization and storage rates to maximize yield as evidenced by further increases in net operating income per square foot as shown on slide 4. Volume across our Records Management business was down 0.1% on a global basis prior to acquisitions or about 700,000 cubic feet. This was driven by negative internal volume growth in North America and a slowdown in, albeit, continued positive volume growth in Europe. The May implementation of GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation is having some impact on behavior related to destructions. Whilst a European regulation focused on protection of personal identifiable information, this regulation has global reach and covers record held by European nationals inside and outside of Europe. Beyond regulatory changes leading to increases in destruction activity from time to time, we have also seen a slowdown of incoming volume. As the incoming rate of new boxes decelerates, the boxes held in inventory naturally age during this period. As the deceleration continues, we expect the ratio of destructions to remain elevated until the rate of incoming global volume normalizes. This interim increase in the rate of destructions is expected to flatten out over time. However, we expect this net volume dynamic to continue for the next few years, and are running our business based on this expectation. Importantly, this impact is de minimis on a bottom line financial basis and does not affect our financial plan in terms of growth and profitability in cash flow as we continue to expect to offset any volume decline through revenue management, as well as growth in new services. Stuart will walk you through some of the financial aspects of all this in a few minutes. In addition, I mentioned earlier that our Information Governance and Digital Solutions business is growing nicely and should, over time, offset some of the volume declines in physical storage as our customers increasingly manage a hybrid physical and digital world in terms of how they conduct their Records Management operations. IGDS provides our customers with the ability to convert physical documents into digital content through the use of migration services supporting customers' digital transformation. Growth has been supported by a robust pipeline of increasingly larger opportunities, as well as greater customer traction. Moreover, in terms of further growing our digitization efforts, our newly announced partnership with Google shows early signs in its potential to increase our IGDS pipeline. With our recently announced InSight Platform, we have already developed proofs-of-concept, working with customers in oil and gas, financial services, and an internal legal application. Additionally, within our services business, we are – Secure Shredding unit experienced another strong quarter, driven by a significant increase in paper prices coupled with a 13% increase in tonnage year-over-year. Moreover, we continue to see new opportunities in largely unvended channels such as the federal government. Specifically on federal government, we were awarded a $65 million five-year blanket purchase agreement with the Department of Homeland Security or DHS. With this agreement, we have the opportunity to deliver significant efficiency gains for DHS providing not only storage and retrieval services, but also accelerating the digital transformation initiatives towards a more modern information governance program. Additionally, we had another award to help the U.S. Army Heritage and Educational Center with their digital transformation and the preservation of historical artifacts. This is an example of what we expect to be an acceleration in U.S. government outsourcing and demonstrates that our efforts over the last few years are delivering results. Another government win came from our Fine Art business where we were subcontracted to relocate the collection of the National Air and Space Museum to temporary storage as a result of extensive renovation that will take six years to complete. Turning now to emerging markets for our Records Management business, we continue to deliver solid internal revenue growth as well as attractive acquisition opportunities to expand our presence in faster growing markets. For example, we recently acquired businesses in China and South Korea which together added more than 3 million cubic feet of storage increasing our scale and further strengthening our position in these countries. Our data center business continues to perform well with revenue, adjusted EBITDA and investment forecast on plan for full year. Development opportunities to provide capacity to support customer demand in high absorption markets at attractive returns remain robust. To that point, as I mentioned earlier, in Q3, we began construction of our second phase of capacity in Phoenix, which is expected to be completed in June 2019. This phase of capacity will be a hyperscale-ready data center for which we have entered into renewable energy commitments that offset 100% of the power. The facility, including future phases, will add more than 530,000 square feet and 48 megawatts of capacity at full build-out. In addition, we are entering the Chicago data center market through a development agreement with the Pritzker Realty Group to develop a 13-acre parcel in this attractive market, which has been tight on capacity for some time. We are currently finalizing design plans and at this time, have not invested any material development capital. The site is expected to permit construction of a 36-megawatt colocation facility to support the digital transformation initiatives of global enterprises, as well as meet the security and performance expectations of the largest public cloud providers. Turning to our Fine Arts business, we continue to focus on expanding our presence in this faster-growing storage-related business, leveraging our core storage expertise and customer service capabilities whilst being accretive to our focus on maximizing yield across our range of storage offerings. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we completed two transactions in the Fine Arts storage business, further strengthening the market position of Crozier Fine Arts business. The first, L.A. packing, crating and transport, strengthens our position in the Los Angeles market. The second transaction, we will assume operations of Christie's Park Royal Warehouse in London, representing Crozier's first Fine Arts storage and service location outside North America. As shown on slide 5, we remain firmly on track to achieve continued internal revenue growth on a global basis fueled by further yield management with ongoing expansion and development in our data center platform and continued growth in our adjacent businesses. Moreover, given the expansion of our higher growth portfolio, which consists of emerging markets, data center, and adjacent businesses, we are approaching approximately 19% of our internal revenue or 23% including the acquisitions in the last 12 months with a goal to be 30% by the end of 2020. Additionally, we continue to deliver improvement across the organization in terms of optimizing utilization and driving margin improvement over time. Altogether, we are within reach to achieve a business mix delivering adjusted EBITDA growth in excess of 5% before acquisitions by the end of 2020. On slide 6, I want to reiterate that we remain on track with our deleveraging and payout ratio targets, which assume a 4% annual increase in dividends per share between now and 2020. We have increased the midpoint of our constant dollar AFFO growth guidance from 9% to 14.5% for the full year 2018. Stuart will discuss the strength of our balance sheet shortly. Overall, we expect revenue growth in 2018 to be between 9% and 11% versus our original guidance of 7% to 9%. We continue to be unique within the S&P 500 in that we are a top yielding company with durable cash flow delivering low- to mid-single digit internal revenue growth, expanding margins, a solid balance sheet, and great long-term growth potential supported by acceleration and contribution from our faster growing portfolio. These factors are driving consistent growth in both the top line and in cash flow that ultimately supports our ability to continue to grow dividends per share at an attractive rate whilst funding investments and delevering over time. This dividend growth model has been further underscored by our announced 4% dividend increase and solid balance sheet. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Bill, and thank you all for joining us this morning. In the third quarter, we delivered strong cash flow growth with solid progress towards our strategic objectives. Our leading Records Management business performed well with steady internal revenue growth and strong margin expansion. Our faster-growing emerging markets, data center, and adjacent businesses are gaining scale and expanding margins, and our disciplined capital allocation supports strong cash flows to fund our multi-year plan. We continue to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders through maintaining healthy performance in our durable records and information management businesses, while investing in data centers and other adjacent businesses for further long-term value creation. This is all underpinned by a substantial high quality portfolio of owned industrial and data center properties. I'll start off with the performance highlights, which you can see on slide 7 and 8 of the presentation. We are trending at or above all of our key financial metrics from our original 2018 constant currency outlook and have increased our guidance for both revenue and AFFO. For the quarter, revenue exceeded our expectations approaching $1.1 billion, growing about 10% on a reported basis, but more than 12% on a constant dollar basis, driven by contributions from our data center acquisitions and strong service revenue growth. Total internal revenue grew about 4.1% compared to the prior year, and we grew internal storage revenue by 2.3% for the quarter or about $14 million and 2.6% year-to-date. We are pleased with the results from revenue management, but these are partially offset by slower volume growth, which I will discuss in more detail later. Internal service revenue grew by 7.1% in the third quarter and by 5.2% year-to-date primarily due to increased contributions from our Shred business, which Bill discussed, as well as additional digitalization and special projects. Our adjusted EBITDA grew almost 15% on a constant dollar basis for the quarter to $364 million, with margins expanding 80 basis points year-over-year to 34.3%. The margin improvement resulted primarily from the flow-through of revenue management, the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and labor productivity including ongoing synergies from the Recall acquisition. I'll provide more color on performance by segment in just a moment. SG&A as a percentage of revenue, excluding Recall and related costs, increased about 30 basis points year-over-year due mainly to investing in new growth initiatives and other technology. The adjusted EBITDA margin improvement came even while making these investments. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 per share, down slightly compared to last year, due mainly to the increased depreciation and amortization associated with acquisitions, as well as an 8% increase in shares outstanding following our December offering to fund the acquisition of IO Data Centers. This is all in line with our guidance at the time of the announcement. AFFO was $680 million year-to-date, up about $80 million or nearly 14% over the prior year, reflecting the strong operating performance, expansion of our data center business and a very disciplined approach to capital allocation while increasing investments in new businesses. We increased the midpoint of our full-year AFFO guidance by $40 million, of which $30 million was from business performance and $10 million was from the adoption of the revenue recognition standard. Year-over-year, AFFO growth is expected to exceed 13%. I'll touch on operating performance in a little more detail. On slide 9, you can see developed markets internal storage revenue growth came in at 0.7% for the quarter despite the negative volume growth, reflecting the impact of revenue management. Internal service revenue in developed markets increased 7.1% for the quarter due mainly to growth in our Shred business, project revenue and digitization as mentioned earlier. In Other International, we continue to see steady internal storage revenue growth of 5.1% – 5.9% for the quarter on 3.6% growth in internal volume for the trailing 12 months with internal service revenue growth of 6.6%. In other reporting segments, the details of which are in the supplemental, the data center business delivered strong internal revenue growth of 27% for the quarter, though off a small base pre-acquisitions. Turning to slide 10, you can see the detail of our 80-basis-point adjusted margin – EBITDA margin expansion with growth in most of the segments. We did experience a margin decline in North America Data Management or tape business, driven by lower volumes as well as customer mix. In the tape-storage business, the amount of digital data being stored continues to grow; however, greater density on data protection tapes is resulting in lower physical volumes. In Western Europe, margins in the quarter were lower than last year as we experienced higher bad debt in France where we are now integrating Recall's business. Note, though, the Western Europe margins are up 190 basis points year-to-date, reflecting our focus on continuous improvement. In the Global Data Center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins have improved over 44% year-to-date, reflecting increased scale of the business and progress on integration activity. We expect data center margins over time to move closer to a mid to high 50% range as we fully integrate recent acquisitions and add more scale to this business. Year-to-date, we have executed 6.3 megawatts of new and expansion leases primarily with enterprise customers and the federal government while churn in the quarter was less than 1%. We remain on-track to achieve 2018 revenue of more than $220 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $100 million, which includes integration cost of $7 million to $10 million. We continue also to expect leasing of around 10 megawatts for the year of new and expansion space. Turning to slide 11, you can see that lease adjusted leverage ratio was 5.6 times at the end of the third quarter, very much in line with our original outlook while having debt funded the acquisition of EvoSwitch data centers in Amsterdam. Our current leverage ratio was comfortably in line with other REITs especially when considering that our business is more durable than many other REIT sectors. As of September 30th, our borrowings were 72% fixed rate, our weighted average borrowing rate was 4.8% and our well-laddered maturity is an average of 6.3 years with no significant maturities until 2023. Our strong balance sheet and capital structure is supported by our significant real estate portfolio and long-term nature of our customer relationships. Turning to our revised outlook for 2018, we now expect total revenue growth of 9% to 11% with total internal revenue growth between 3.5% and 3.75%, up from 2% to 3% initially. Our outlook for internal storage rental revenue growth is revised downward to 2.5% to 2.75% with total volumes expected to be slightly down for the year 2018 prior to acquisitions. We've also increased our outlook for AFFO growth, while narrowing our adjusted EBITDA guidance. The details of which can be found on page 6 of the supplemental. We would also like to remind you about the exchange rate impact on our reported results that we communicated on the Q2 earnings call. Exchange rate headwinds have strengthened since then and we've added reported dollar ranges reflective of the headwind to our guidance page in the supplemental. In addition, we have refined our cash available for dividends and discretionary investments schedule on slide 12 to reflect our expectation of lower cash taxes and interest expense, as well as a lower level of acquisitions in Records Management and slightly higher proceeds from real estate dispositions generating more internal cash to fund investments. While we plan to provide comprehensive 2019 guidance on our February earnings call, at this time, we're basing our business plan on an expectation that internal volume will continue to be negative in North America and total internal revenue growth to be in the low-single digits. As in this quarter, we continue to expect revenue management to more than offset any global volume decline and to continue growing our internal storage rental revenue in 2019. While we continue to see good progress in our IGDS business, we do recognize that paper prices in our Shred business are at all-time highs which we do not expect to repeat in 2019. We remain confident in our ability to grow adjusted EBITDA, cash flows and, ultimately, our dividend in line with our 2020 plan. To further underscore our confidence, I would like to provide some perspective around the volume moderation. For illustrative purposes, what for example might be the impact, if we had a global volume net decline as large as 1% of total volume or 7 million cubic feet, which is 10 times larger than anything we've experienced. If you assume the volume decrease comes from a combination of fewer incoming boxes and increased destructions, the revenue lost from the fewer incoming boxes would be largely offset by an increase in destruction-related fees even before any paper revenue. So, in the first year, the EBITDA impact would be de minimis. In second year, the lost revenue would be about $20 million or $3 per cubic foot. So, even if the global level of decline was 10 times greater than what we're currently seeing, we could absorb the impact with faster growth in our other businesses, better revenue management or cost saving initiatives and continue to achieve our 2020 plan. In summary, we remain on track to continue strengthening our balance sheet while funding our targeted dividend increases such as that announced this morning. We expect our strong cash flow generation to enable us to fund dividend increases while improving our AFFO payout ratio. We are pleased with our third quarter business performance and results year-to-date. Our revenue management is working well, driving steady growth and strong margin expansion in Records Management business. Further, we remain intently focused on integrating and scaling our data center platform. We look forward updating you on our progress and providing more detail to 2019 guidance on the Q4 earnings call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we'd open it up for Q&A.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Stuart. To summarize, we've had a strong quarter both in terms of financial results, as well as progress on our strategic plan. Key financial highlights include upping our AFFO and revenue guidance for the year, increased dividend by 4% whilst improving dividend coverage. In terms of key strategic highlights, continued margin improvement, build-out of our faster-growing adjacent and emerging business areas. They now represent almost 19% of sales mix or 23% post-acquisition. This mix is already delivering 4% organic EBITDA growth, some 200 basis points better than three years ago and in line with our 5% organic EBITDA growth goal for 2020. So, we are well on track for our 2020 objectives, given our successful shift in business mix. Now, operator, we would like to open up for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You've indicated that you're largely done with implementing your revenue management initiatives in the U.S. Can you discuss your progress on rolling out your initiatives in Europe and Asia and frame how continued rollout will alter your internal growth rates going forward in storage?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. No, it's a good question, George. So, I think – let me answer it in two parts. So, first is that when we say we've completed roll – we've rolled out the infrastructure but we continue to expect similar levels in absolute terms of revenue management benefit in developed markets next year as we did this year. So, continuing to get that kind of benefit that we've seen in this past year from revenue management for North America in Europe. In terms of how we're rolling that out, you can even start seeing that in this quarter in terms of – historically, you'll recall that if you've looked at our internal revenue growth in the emerging markets, you would see that that was almost all driven by volume, and you can now start seeing that we're actually getting positive traction if you – I know one's on a sequential basis and one's on a year-over – or trailing 12 months basis. But if you look – the numbers aren't "directly comparable", but you can start seeing that they're starting to actually get a positive spread. So, we've rolled out – doing this top of my head, we have a center now, I think, it's in São Paulo. We have one I think in Hong Kong. We have one in Budapest, and there's one in Sydney or Melbourne, I should say. So, we've got four new pricing clusters if you will or where we've actually invested in pricing expertise. And you're now starting to see that spread where we're getting even more in the emerging markets and we expect that to accelerate. So, if you say, if we go forward into 2019 just to underscore this, we expect to get a similar level of absolute dollar benefit or uplift from Western Europe and North America as we did in 2018. And we expect to get further increases next year. So, we'll do even better on revenue management, but it will be coming from the emerging markets.
George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up shifting to look at your services business, you talk a little bit about shred paper price trends for next year. Can you talk about on a underlying basis, how service activity is currently evolving, how conversations with customers are changing there and how retrieval and new business activity will alter or not alter the growth trends in services?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So, yeah. So let me answer it at a – in a first cut and then Stuart may want to talk a little bit more about paper prices because paper prices are a big driver in terms of the results that you've seen in service, because we're benefiting from quite strong paper prices right now. So, if you think about it kind of in roughly three buckets of service as we have the Shred, we would have what I would call the normal transportation and activity service level around RIM. And then we have new business service areas around IGDS. So on the Shred, there's two aspects and I'll ask Stuart to comment again about the paper pricing. But if you see that our volumes are up by 13%. So in other words, we are actually – so there is an activity aspect about Shred which we expect to continue through in 2019. The other part is the benefit that we get on service revenue from selling the paper. If we look at the transportation, our transportation activity continues to slow down, but I think as we've said before on previous calls, if we look at the box business, that's starting to hit a more steady state level. On the tape business, we still see a drop in terms of transportation as the tape business is becoming more archival as well. But where the real improvement has been in service, so the story of all of a sudden going to positive service is not so much a change in the transportation; it's more about these new digital services or Information Governance and Digital Services that we're operating. And over the last two or three years, we've seen a doubling in that size of that business. So it's really – we're quite encouraged that as our customers are trying to manage this hybrid digital physical world, the relationships that we have developed with them on information management over the decades where it was historically more in the physical realm is really giving us the opportunities to help them manage that transition. And we think partnerships such as the Google partnership will continue to add products in that pipeline that can only accelerate that. So, we feel really good in terms of our set-up for 2019 to continue to build out and grow the Information Governance and Digital Services. And we've had a great last couple of years in terms of growth and we expect that type of growth to continue. I think the transportation to me now is, it's still waning a little bit, but it's being more than offset by our growth in Shred and in IGDS. And then going into 2019, I'll turn it over to Stuart, is that the paper prices are an impact in terms of what 2019 will look like.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. So just to quantify the impact of paper prices, were paper prices to revert back to the historical three-year average from where they are today, that would be about a 100-basis-point impact on service internal growth.
George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC: Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on your revenue management approach. Do you believe some of the elevated destructions are a result of customers revisiting these boxes under a higher pricing scheme?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's a good question, Sheila, and we continue to monitor it. We don't see – it could on the margin, but we don't see a major link in terms of what we're doing on pricing in terms of increasing destruction. The major increase in destruction, as I said, was in part by the GDPR coming into effect at the end of May. So, that was forcing people to re-look at the way that they retain Personal Identifiable Information. By the way, it also leads to more opportunities on the IGDS, I should say. And then, the other part is is we have seen a deceleration in terms of incoming volume from verticals – or from customer segments. I should emphasize that virtually every customer segment is still sending us new boxes, but as the rate has reduced over the last months is what happens is that you get a deceleration of incoming, the boxes that they've already sent us are not being replaced at the same rate. And, generally, what we find is in the 0 to 7 year mark is when people more – it's usually around the 7 to 10 year mark is when people do their destructions. If they keep things over 10 years, it tends to be kept for very long periods of time. So, it's in that 7 to 10 year – the number of boxes that are in the 7 to 10 year mark is the one where we see the destructions happen. And if incoming boxes are coming in at a slower rate, then you get an imbalance between what's being destroyed at year 7 or 10 versus what's coming in. So, we just have to kind of go through this process of albeit it's still positive incoming volume, but get that into balance and then we expect it to even out over time.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: The other thing I'll add, Sheila, is just to remember, so if you look at implied price in North America Records Management, it's about 3%. So it's nothing really extreme. It's just higher than what it was historically. And you also have to remember, this is a pretty small part of people's cost base in terms of where they're trying to save money.
Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Just one follow-up question on margin. It was positive to see EBITDA margin increase 80 basis points in the quarter. Just wondering when you look at your mix adding the increase in the data center percentage, just the outlook of margin trends' bigger picture over the next few years.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. One thing. If you look at the margin trends in the quarter, we're impacted also by the increase in service revenue, which is a lower margin business. Over time as the data center business continues to grow, that will be at a higher average margin in the rest of the business. So you'll get some positive mix impact from that. So, if you go and you look at our 2020 guidance, that implies basically from where we are at 2018 of 200 to 250 basis point margin expansion over time. So a lot of that will come from the continuous improvement initiatives that we have, around cost of sales, SG&A, obviously the pricing flow through on the revenue management that we were talking about a little while ago, as well as we'll continue to get margin expansion in emerging markets as we lever up with – continue to grow those businesses and get the leverage of higher revenue on a fixed cost base. So, every part of that business should contribute including data center growing as well as the margin there expanding from where we are today.
Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird & Co. Please go ahead.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'll just keep going with the margins here. We've heard a lot of kind of outsourced business service companies talking about the impact of the tight labor market, as well as fuel costs. Stuart, probably for you, can you just comment on how that affected the quarter and how that's impacting your outlook as you move into 2019?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. If you look at what's going on in the – actually in labor in the third quarter, actually was one of our biggest margin improvement drivers and that's continuing synergies from Recall. So, actually if you look at our current results, actually our labor was favorable. Some of that are also driven by the health and welfare costs as we've changed our provider and continue to manage those costs well. The other side of it, if you look forward, we are seeing labor pressure and there's lots of demand for warehouse workers and for drivers. There is a somewhat of a pass-through to our customers in terms of the revenue management, right? It's one of the things when we're talking to our customers, they understand that there's a labor inflation going on out there, so it's one of the reasons that we're able to get the pricing float that we do. In fuel which we mentioned, fuel, there's – that we do have a fuel surcharge that we can pass through to our customers as well when prices move up.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. Just one thing I'll just add, Andy, to Stuart's comments is that the fuel, let's just say, from most of the logistics companies is positive, but the other thing is, is that we still have a long way to run in terms of the productivity that we think we can drive. So, whilst at one level, you're right, the competition for warehouse workers and drivers is keen. On the other side, if you look at this year, we consolidated 30 facilities and we expect to consolidate another 19 next year. So, we are looking for ways to continue to streamline our back end. It allows us to get more labor productivity.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Helpful perspective. Thanks on that. Just on the data center strategy next kind of to finish up on this one at least for me. Previously, I guess you reiterated the greater than $200 million of revenue. I think, previously, you guys talked about a little bit more EBITDA than you signaled on this call. Just curious as to what the differential is on that. Is it just – is it timing of when some of these kick in? Is it the rates that you're able to achieve, maybe just kind of an update on kind of on the lease-up and the profit margins that you expect here?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I'm glad you asked the clarifying question. The numbers in my script included integration costs. So, we've talked previously about exit run rate and we're right on track with those numbers.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. All right.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: About $10 million of EBITDA.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. About $10 million more of EBITDA over what the 2018 number is when you look at the exit run rate.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Nathan Crossett of Berenberg. Please go ahead.
Nathan Crossett - Berenberg Capital Markets: Yes. Just to kind of follow up on the data centers, I believe you said it's around 8% of EBITDA in your prepared remarks. When we think kind of long term maybe five years plus, how should we think about where that percentage could migrate to? Could we get to a level that could be 30%, 40% data centers for you guys?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So, Nathan, I think, at this point, we've only guided out to 2020. So, what we thought – so, yeah, I'd love to give you a longer-term guidance, but so good try. But, anyways, in 2020, we've guided it will be about 10% of our EBITDA. But if you – you can even see it at 10% given the growth rates that we're getting. That's why we're saying this is driving 1% to 2% of the consolidated EBITDA growth just in and of itself. So, it's already becoming an important driver towards our march to 5% EBITDA growth in 2020. And just a reset because I know that you've come on to our story recently, when we started this journey before, we were only at about 2% organic – even a little bit less than 2% EBITDA organic growth. So we're actually making good progress and data center has already proving to be a large component. But we'll keep you updated as we start extending our horizon beyond 2020 in terms of how we see that shaping up. But you can expect it to be, continue to be a major driver in terms of our EBITDA growth.
Nathan Crossett - Berenberg Capital Markets: Sure. And maybe you can comment just on potentially converting some of your storage facilities to data centers. I remember you guys saying when you did the EvoSwitch transaction, there was I think a few facilities nearby that were storage facilities that you could convert. So I'm just wondering if you did an analysis kind of across the rest of your portfolio and just wondering how many centers could maybe be converted over time?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's a very good question. So you're right. I'll be specific. In Amsterdam, there is a facility that we're looking at Amsterdam to do exactly that. And there's two other facilities in North America one which we've gone to a fair amount of detail and it's associated with a potential customer. And then in other case, it's because of the advantageous power rates that we can get because of our historical footprint. So there's two facilities in the U.S. that we're actively look – two locations in the U.S. we're actively looking at. And then obviously you just highlighted the Amsterdam one which we've talked about before. So those are three areas where we continue to develop our thinking.
Nathan Crossett - Berenberg Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks. And then just one quick final question. Can you talk a little bit about the China storage acquisition and kind of how you view the long-term opportunity in China? Is that a large untapped market for you guys?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, it was – it's a really good question. So, China is growing low-double digits in terms of organic volume growth. So, it is an important market for us and we are now the leading international player. We were before, but now we're firmly the leading international player in that market after this recent acquisition. There are two parts of the Chinese market, so I feel really good about our ability to serve multinationals in the China market. And the way we approach the market, the types of services we provide is very familiar with them because they expect that kind of service everywhere they go in the world. The other part of the market is the state-owned enterprise in China. And we do have some state-owned enterprise customers, but that's an area which is more difficult to penetrate quite frankly as a multinational. So, our business case and business plans associated with China are more around serving multinationals or Chinese companies that are looking for that kind of service. And, over time, we think we will be able to access more fully say the state-owned enterprise channel. But, right now, I would say our state-owned enterprises and as you know is a big part of the Chinese economy is relatively limited.
Nathan Crossett - Berenberg Capital Markets: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. This is Michael Cho in for Andrew. I just had a follow-up on the margin discussion that we just had. I guess, first, the clarifying question was does the change in the margin guide for 2018 is just a difference in business mix? And two, just more longer term, Stuart, I know you gave some color on it. But, historically, we've thought about Iron Mountain's margin expansion from really two buckets of Recall and transformation or efficiencies, and then I realized there's pricing and other efficiencies in data centers that you talked of. Can you just help us frame a little bit better the magnitude of contribution from some of those pieces that you mentioned as we go from 34.0% margins to 36.8% at the midpoint in 2020?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, Michael. So, first of all, yeah, the 2000 – in terms of taking the revenue guidance up and keeping the EBITDA guidance largely the same, it is primarily mix and really in the service business and you can see that obviously the internal growth on the service side. So, then, if you take that and look forward to the sort of the 250 basis point margin improvement, then that sort of is implied from the current midpoint of guidance in 2018 to sort of the midpoint of 2020 in terms of what that plan is. The 250 basis points, I think you can think about it in the sense that about half of that will come from continuous improvement and cost reductions. Bill touched briefly on productivity improvements we think we can keep making. And then, on top of that, then you'll get some mix benefit from data center as the data center margins itself grows, as those businesses integrated, as well as that business growing. And then, you'll get leverage in emerging markets from M&A primarily as well as organic growth as we've over time built up the infrastructure to support a larger business. And you continue to see the margins in emerging markets expand quite nicely and then margin expansion in developing markets in addition from the continuous improvement also coming from revenue management.
Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Eric Compton of Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Eric Compton - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to kind of switch back to the volume growth kind of discussion. So, I guess, first, as people are changing, not bringing as much physical paper storage or whatever and they're switching to digital, do you guys disclose any numbers on what percentage of the business is being replaced kind of with these digital initiatives?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: No. I mean, other than the segments we already report, no. But, also, let me just kind of put it back into context. So, if you look at the math that Stuart took you through and let's take the year two because the year two is after you don't get the benefit for the one-time charges when people actually pull things out for destruction is that we're talking about at the rates that we're seeing around a $2 million EBITDA impact because, remember, he gave you an example that's 10 times anything that we see or expect to happen in what we can see going forward. So, this is really a very small impact. I mean, on a business that's approaching $1.5 billion for that matter in EBITDA, but over $1.4 billion as we sit here today, a couple million in EBITDA associated with this trend is de minimis, so it's not a major thing. We don't break out the segments more fine than you want, but on the other side is where if you ask me the question a different way, are we getting more than $2 million of EBITDA from our uplift in IGDS services or Information Governance and Digital Services, absolutely. So, we're more than getting – we're getting – as we're helping our customers on this digital transformation journey going from the – in this hybrid world is we're more than picking up what we're losing on the volume side. So, it's not one versus the other.
Eric Compton - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Got you. That's super helpful. And then, my last one is, you said you kind of expect some of the change in customer behavior with this volume to potentially reverse over time. Is that just related to kind of, if I understood your first example correctly, kind of a silly example, you might have a client that was previously bringing maybe five boxes a year and now they've changed to four, so you'll kind of get that one-time downdraft. Then as long as they stay at four, kind of that initial decrease will sort of reverse so to speak. Is that kind of the main driver there or are there any other kind of longer term reasons you'd expect this kind of acceleration in declining volume to reverse? Thanks.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. You've got it. Absolutely. That's exactly the dynamic is going on. And then the wildcard, so to speak, on the up side is that if some of the un-vended market or less vended markets that we've talked about before is those things start coming in and those things can kind of offset that while you're going through that process. But that process alone is the thing that's the key driver at this point.
Operator: The next question will come from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Stuart, I think you said in your comments that there was about $30 million of business changes that drove the AFFO guidance increase. Can you just detail what contributed to that $30 million?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Karin, I think probably the easiest thing to do is to refer you to the year-to-date calculation in the supplemental of the reconciliation of AFFO. But a couple things that I talked about is, you've got taxes coming in lower than we originally expected, interest expense is favorable from a capital standpoint, continuing to focus. Yeah. I should also refer you back to the guidance page as well where you see some of the detail, but some of the efficiencies that we're getting around maintenance capital as well as then just sort of the underlying business performance. Those are the key drivers, and I did mention that of the total $40 million increase in the AFFO at the midpoint, about $10 million of that is from better flow-through to AFFO of revenue recognition change. So I did want to call that out because that is different than our previous guidance as well.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And I wanted to go back to that volume loss example that you described. You're expecting continuing volume pressure next year on top of what we've seen this year. So, if you think you'll see a bigger impact in year two versus year one, given the fact that you no longer have the fees offsetting, should we expect more pressure on revenue next year given that sort of pattern there?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So I think as Bill discussed with – the trends that you see are really incredibly small, right. So, even if it was the same global volume declines we saw now, it was around $2 million. So, the example I gave is what I would probably classify almost as an extreme scenario, right, 10 times what we're seeing today. And which Bill talked about was easily offset by digitization services, but there's lots of other things we can use to offset that as well.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Got it. But understanding that the numbers are in the $2 million range, just trend wise, we should expect to see a little bigger impact if volumes continue to come down next year versus what we saw this year, right?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's not a – we expect it to maintain around this level, Karin. So, we're not seeing a compounding effect if that's what you're getting at.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. That was my question.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So, we're not talking about next year would be compounded on top of that. We would see it at a similar level as what we have now. Yeah.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Great.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: That's what we're planning for and then we'll issue guidance in February.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. Just a question on pricing; so developed market internal revenue growth was 70 basis points. That was a 60-basis-point deceleration from the 2Q level. The volume deceleration was only 30 basis points. So, should we read into that that you're getting less benefit from pricing and revenue management from 2Q to 3Q?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: No. And I know it's always hard to put together because we do it on two different bases. But if you're just kind of trying to do the rough mathematics, it's still that we're getting kind of high 2% range for North America and on a blended basis, you're getting the mid-2%s across the globe. So, it's still in the same range.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. And then, last question's just on data center. So, it looked like in the supp, there were a few changes to your investment volume and timing on a few of the different projects, Arizona being the biggest. You talked about that one. It also looks like Northern Virginia and then in the Boyers and Other category, there were some investments you showed in 2Q that are no longer there. Can you just talk about what those changes were?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. In the supplemental and the development activity, we actually added more detail to clarify sort of what's actually under construction today versus what's future construction. So, we broke those pieces out because there were some things that were – that are held for future development and able to be built up, but not currently under construction. So, we just broke those pieces out for you. So, the data is still there. It's just in separate columns.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Got it. And can you just talk about the size – the potential size on your return expectation on the new Chicago development?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's still early days in terms of what it's going to be. We're in the process right now as Bill talked about in the script. This is – the Pritzker Realty Group has got land in the Chicago market that is currently being prepared. They're doing site preparation work now. We will develop about 36 megawatts on that site is what the plan is. It won't actually start construction probably until – it could be late Q4, probably in the first quarter. And so, we're mentioning this today. We'll put out a formal announcement to the broker community soon so we can start pre-leasing on that.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: And you'll buy the land and provide the capital for the project?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: The land will actually be contributed. So, it'll be – it's not a legal joint venture. It's structured as a land lease, but it'll basically operate like a joint venture where the Pritzker Realty Group can participate in the upside as they help us with – in the Chicago market with local companies and things like that. So, they've got some skin in the game as well and get part of the upside.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you. Hey, just one thing I wanted to – it feels like the business is a little less predictable just kind of looking at kind of the pure storage versus service components over the course of this year. So, what I want to do is there any way to frame out like what the delta is between kind of the step-up in the service because it looks like this service has been over kind of 7%, which is a great outcome for you folks. But how much of that is kind of sorted office paper, how much is the pickup and destructions, and then how much of that is the new GMBS (sic) [GDPR] initiative? And that was actually my first question. And then, just what percentage of the EBITDA today is sorted office paper?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: If you go back and look at – if you look at total Shred business, Kevin, you've got about a third of that is from the sale of paper. So you can go back and...
Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: ...sort of do the math on that. If you look at sort of third quarter, total shredding revenue was up about 15% or $15 million year-over-year. And if you remember, from a paper pricing standpoint, last year was actually a little bit of a dip compared to where we are this year. So, of the $15 million increase, about $6 million to $7 million of that increase is paper price. And the rest really has to do with volume in bin tips as the business continues to grow. We've done some tuck-ins as well in that business. And so, you've seen good margin expansion in the performance. Business is performing really, really well.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: But I think, Kevin, just to pick up on your predictability, as you've been following this story for a long time, so you kind of go back is when you first started, we were 2% organic EBITDA growth. We're seeing here 4% EBITDA growth. The company was struggling to maintain $900 million of EBITDA. We're now approaching $1.5 billion of EBITDA. So, when we talk about $6 million or $7 million coming from paper, this is – quite frankly, I'm not complacent. I chase every million dollars, but this is noise in the way we run the system. So, if you sit there and say we're approaching 5% EBITDA growth organically before we do an acquisition whereas when you started following us, we were less than 2%, is the business is a lot easier, it can take a lot more noise in the system than it used to. So, I actually think the predictability of the robustness of the businesses is really strong.
Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And then, just, Stuart, the delta because it looks like the storage revenue, the guide for the full year came down to 2.5% to 2.75% versus 3% to 3.5%. Does that imply that back half deceleration and was that primarily all volume-driven? Is it kind of took those numbers down?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. I mean you see it in the year-to-date numbers, so it is primarily volume-driven in the storage side. As well, the offset looking forward, right, some of the other storage businesses as companies get more digital, we continue to invest in Iron Cloud and Iron Mountain in the InSight product that we're offering. So, we're continuing to talk to our customers about what needs they have. And so, going back to sort of Bill's point on the predictability, these are numbers despite us actually increasing investments in some of those new businesses.
Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Understood. Thank you.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I now would like to turn the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Melissa Marsden: Thank you, Keith. Hello, and welcome to our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. The user-controlled slides that we’ll be referring to in today's prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations Web site along with the link to today's webcast. You can find the presentation at ironmountain.com under About Us/Investors/Events & Presentations. Alternatively, you can access today's financial highlights press release, the presentation and the full supplemental financial information together as one PDF file by going to investors.ironmountain.com and refer to Financial Information. Additionally, we have filed all of the related documents as one 8-K, which is also available on the IR Web site. On today's call, we'll first hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain President and CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic plan followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover financial results. Referring now to Page 2 of the presentation, today's earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2018 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, and the Safe Harbor language on this slide as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-Q which we expect to file later today for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Meaney: Thank you, Melissa, and hello, everyone. We’re pleased to report another strong quarter of financial and operating results that demonstrate the durability of Iron Mountain’s global storage rental revenue, the relevance of some of our new service offerings and continued progress against our 2020 strategic plan. Our performance, outlined on Page 3 of the presentation, is on track with our full year expectations as illustrated by total revenue growth of 11% on a constant dollar basis, strong growth in adjusted EBITDA with 130 basis points increase in EBITDA margins, continued durability of our storage business with internal revenue growth of 2.7% for the quarter and 3.2% for the year-to-date after adjusting to last year’s data center early lease termination fee. Strong internal revenue growth of 7.6% for the quarter and 4.2% year-to-date driven by solid growth in our digitalization in special projects business as well as shred and further expansion of our global data center platform both through internal development and acquisition, including EvoSwitch based in Amsterdam, a top 5 global market. Globally, we continue to see growth in internal storage volume. However, you will see us increasingly emphasize yield management when looking at our developed markets as we continue to maximize yield rather than market share by focusing on net operating income per foot. In our other international segments, total internal revenue is driven more by volume where organic volume growth was 3.8% in the quarter. In developed markets, which include our North American Records and Information Management, North American Data Management and Western European segments, we achieved internal storage revenue growth of 1.3% for the quarter driven by revenue management despite a 1% decrease in internal records volume on a trailing 12-month basis, due in part to an uptick in destruction related to the release of legal hold. New volume from existing customers globally was stable in the quarter and we continue to prioritize volume from new customers supported by our focus on penetration of unvended segments such as the midmarket and the U.S. federal government. Turning to Slide 4, we continue to make progress on the execution of our strategic plan. As you will recall, we are extending our durable business model through continued nurturing of our developed markets, expanding into faster growing emerging markets and investing in storage-related adjacent businesses such as data centers as well as art and entertainment services. We continue to listen to our customers and identify new opportunities to provide innovative solutions in services to both new and existing customers. The significant growth in internal service revenue in the second quarter was in a large part driven by growth in shred mainly due to higher paper prices, higher level of destruction of record and growth in customers. We’re also seeing good growth in our digitization business. An example of this is a project we are undertaking for a major North American bank who is challenged by application form accuracy and turnaround times from their third party resellers. The bank found its vending process had been taking up to three days with higher than acceptable error rates representing lost revenue. We proposed a complete solution for tens of thousands of file and are ensuring the bank files are now securely uploaded for ingestion into their systems and applications are securely stored electronically for future retrieval. Paper documents are stored according to retention policies and later securely destroyed. As a result, this customer has been able to reduce their SLAs for new accounts down to 24 hours and virtually eliminate errors in keying. We’re excited by the potential for similar projects within our information governance and digital solutions business as our customers increasingly see us as a critical go-to partner for effective management of their hybrid physical and digital information management needs. Our newly announced partnership with Google only reinforces this. Turning now to emerging markets for our records management business, we continue to see solid internal growth as well as attractive acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we closed on two transactions in EMEA leveraging our scale and infrastructure in these regions. Our deeper penetration into these faster growing markets supports enhanced market leadership and we expect to drive margins higher. As I noted earlier during the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of EvoSwitch for approximately €205 million or 14x 2018 adjusted EBITDA giving us 11 megawatts of existing data center capacity in the Netherlands which is 100% leased with the expansion capability of an additional 23 megawatts for a total potential capacity of 34 megawatts. EvoSwitch operates one of the largest colocation facilities in the Amsterdam region. Its existing campus supports more than 50 connectivity and telecommunication providers and it has an attractive diversified base of global customers, including multinational enterprises, cloud service providers and public sector institutions. The Amsterdam region is the second largest data center market in Europe enhancing our presence in what I’ll refer to as the FLAP data center markets; Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Paris following our entry into London early in this year through the purchase of a data center facility from Credit Suisse. In addition, we broke ground early in the third quarter on a new building at the IO data center campus in Phoenix, one of the fastest growing markets in the U.S. The new building can ultimately accommodate 48 megawatts of capacity with the first of two phases of construction scheduled for completion in June 2019 delivering 24 megawatts. When combined with current and potential capacity, the Phoenix camp, this will be able to support approximately 100 megawatts in one of the U.S.’s highest absorption markets. You can see from our reported results for the data center segments that we are on track for annualized results of more than $200 million worth of revenue this year and $115 million to $120 million of adjusted EBITDA after normalizing for full quarter contribution from the EvoSwitch acquisition. Driven by the acceleration of enterprise data center outsourcing to third parties and attractive growth characteristics of the business, we have shifted some of our growth capital from acquisitions in the records management business towards development with our existing portfolio of data center opportunities. Stuart will have more on these minor shifts to our capital allocation guidance shortly. I’m sure many of you saw the announcement earlier this week of our partnership with Google that I referenced earlier. Starting in September we will offer joint solutions that allow customers to unlock their physical and digital data to enhance insights, improve decision making and uncover new revenue opportunities whilst ensuring data privacy and security. Our customers increasingly ask us how we may help them create value from their data so they are not missing opportunities to mine that data to uncover new revenue. We believe the combination of our customer base comprising more than 95% of the Fortune 1000 with deep industry vertical expertise together with Google’s machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities can help customers make their physical and digital information more useful and accessible whilst keeping it safe. Although it is early days, we are excited by the potential represented by this partnership with Google. Our expansion in the data center business and this new partnership with Google are great examples of how we are seeking to enhance investment returns whilst also supporting customers’ storage and information needs across a broad range of formats and asset types where the physical documents, hybrid physical digital records, backup tape, digital data in the cloud or physical space and power within our data centers, these offerings are all part of the information management ecosystem for which we’re developing offering such as Iron Cloud and other SaaS solutions. And our fine art, entertainment services and other adjacent businesses also align with our focus on maximizing yield. In fact, if you look at the net operating income we’ve generated on a per square foot basis on Slide 5, we have continued to grow this across our range of storage businesses. As shown on Slide 6, we expect the consistent internal revenue growth in our internal business together with the expansion of our data center platform and recent transactions and other adjacent businesses to drive faster growth with improved margins over time. Before acquisitions, we are well on track to achieve a business mix delivering adjusted EBITDA growth in excess of 5% before acquisitions by 2020. Year-to-date, this is consistent with the progression that’s fueled by 3.6% internal revenue growth. Moreover, given the growth in our data center and adjacent businesses, our growth portfolio which consists of emerging markets, data center and adjacent businesses is already approaching 25% of our revenue mix which is our goal to achieve by the end of 2020. On Slide 7, I want to reiterate that we remain on track with our deleveraging and payout ratio targets which assume a 4% annual increase in dividends per share between now and 2020. Stuart will address the progress we have made on our balance sheet shortly. Before turning the call over to Stuart, I’d like to note that in addition to extending revenue management programs across our portfolio, we also retain the ability to pass through inflation-based price increases on an annual basis. And given the high margin characteristics of our storage business, we achieved significant flow through on these increases enhancing our ability to deliver meaningful dividend per share growth and not just nominal but in real terms. We continue to be unique within the S&P 500 and that we are a top yielding company that is durable and has strong internal growth, expanding margins, a solid balance sheet and great long-term growth potential supported by acceleration and the contribution from our faster growing portfolio. These factors are driving consistent growth in both the top line and in cash flow that ultimately supports our ability to continue to grow dividends per share whilst delevering over time. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Stuart.
Stuart Brown: Thank you, Bill, and thank you all for joining us today. I’m excited to discuss our solid results that demonstrate continued progress against our near-term and long-term objectives. Our records management business continues to deliver steady organic revenue growth and strong margin expansion, while at the same time we’re achieving meaningful scale and faster growing adjacent businesses. We remain focused on driving increased value for our shareholders through strong current performance combined with investments in our data center and other adjacent businesses. Let me start off by quickly walking you through the highlights before providing a bit more detail. You can see both the quarter and year-to-date performance on slides 8 and 9 of the presentation which show results trending mostly ahead of our annual outlook. For the quarter, revenue came in at about $1.1 billion growing 11% on a constant dollar basis, driven by the impact of our data center acquisitions and solid internal storage revenue growth. Our internal storage revenue growth adjusted for last year’s termination fee was 2.7% for the quarter and 3.2% year-to-date, which is in line with our 3% to 3.5% annual guidance. This reflects solid underlying fundamentals, benefits from our revenue management program and positive net global storage volumes. Our internal revenue growth is calculated to exclude any impact of the new revenue recognition standard; however, the accounting change has had some minor impact on reported storage and service revenue mix. Internal service revenue grew 7.6% in the second quarter and 4.2% in the first half, primarily due to contribution from our shred business, which Bill discussed, as well as additional digitalization and other projects. Our gross profit margin improved by 70 basis points in the quarter primarily driven by labor efficiencies and the flow through of our revenue management program. SG&A as a percentage of revenue also improved, about 60 basis points year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA grew almost 15% on a constant dollar basis for the quarter to $369 million with margins expanding 130 basis points reflecting the benefits of recall synergies and our transformation initiative, flow through from revenue management initiatives, contribution from our higher margin data center business and the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. When excluding the approximately $6 million of benefits from the data center, data center early lease termination fee and other non-recurring items recorded a year ago, our adjusted EBITDA margins in the quarter expanded 190 basis points. Also our structural tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%, a bit higher than our annual guidance as a result of higher rates in the international markets and increased depreciation and amortization in our qualified REIT subsidiary associated with recent data center acquisitions. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.30 per share, flat compared to last year due partly to the increased depreciation and amortization as well as increased shares outstanding following our December offering to fund the acquisition of IO data centers. AFFO was $451 million for the first half, up $63 million or more than 16% over the prior year and is trending towards the upper end of our guidance for 2018. Providing a little more color on our internal growth performance for the year, on Slide 10, you can see the impact of our revenue management efforts reflected in developed markets internal storage revenue growth of 1.3% for the quarter. This quarter’s growth is slightly lower as we cycle over a strong 3.4% internal growth in the second quarter of 2017. Developed markets internal volume growth was negative, about 1% on a trailing 12-month basis on a base of more than 500 million cubic feet in storage. Internal service revenue in developed markets increased 7.6% for the quarter due mainly to growth in our shred business, project revenue and digitization as mentioned earlier. In other international, we continue to see steady storage internal revenue growth of 5.9% for the quarter with service internal revenue growth of 6%. In other reporting segments, the details of which are in the supplemental, the legacy data center business delivered strong internal revenue growth of almost 35% for the quarter, albeit off a small base after adjusting for last year’s early lease termination fee. Turning to Slide 11, you can see our margin expansion with growth in almost all segments. In the global data center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins while down slightly on a reported basis improved nicely after adjusting for last year’s early termination fee reflecting our scaling of the business. We expect data center margins over time to move closer to the mid to high 50% range as we fully integrate recent acquisitions and add more scale to this business. Year-to-date, we have executed 4.4 megawatts of new leases primarily with enterprise customers and the federal government. Based on our leasing pipeline, we are tracking well relative to our 10 megawatts of expected leasing this year and we are pleased with progress considering that our Phoenix data centers were 100% leased at acquisition. Turning to Slide 12, you can see that our lease adjusted leverage ratio was 5.6x at the end of the second quarter consistent with the first quarter and after closing the EvoSwitch transaction. Our current leverage ratio is comfortably in line with other REITs especially when considering that our business is more durable than many other REIT sectors. Additionally, during the second quarter we refinanced our line of credit reducing interest on drawn and undrawn balances by 25 basis points and extending the maturity. As you can see in the supplemental, as of June 30, our borrowings were 74% fixed rate, our weighted average borrowing rate was 4.8% and our well laddered maturity is an average of 6.6 years. We believe this is an appropriate structure supported by our real estate portfolio and long-term nature of our customer relationships. With regard to guidance, we remain comfortable with the constant dollar outlook we laid out on our February call, which is in our supplemental materials for your reference. While exchange rates have had a modestly positive impact on year-to-date results versus a year ago, at current exchange rates we expect the strengthening dollar to result in a headwind of about $50 million to reported revenue in the back half of the year which will flow through to EBITDA. Just a reminder that we evaluate the business on a constant dollar basis and that outlook is unchanged. We do, however, anticipate greater capital efficiencies as you have seen through the first half of the year, so expect full year AFFO to be at the higher end of our guidance range. I’d like to draw your attention to our cash sources and uses on Slide 13 of the presentation, which we have updated since our last quarterly call to reflect the acquisition of EvoSwitch, capital recycling proceeds from the sale of three infill properties in London as well as anticipated additional development to expand our data center capacity in Phoenix and Amsterdam. Our strong operating performance and capital discipline has allowed us to keep leverage flat while borrowing to fund EvoSwitch. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter business performance and results of the first half. Our revenue management initiative is working well, driving steady growth and strong margin expansion from our records management business. Further, we remain very encouraged with the progress in data center and the prospects for creating meaningful value for shareholders through expanding the platform. We’re building out a well-rounded competitive data center portfolio with strong growth and a healthy outlook. We look forward to updating you on our progress on these elements over the coming quarters. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we open it up for Q&A.
William Meaney: Thank you, Stuart. I just wish to make some quick comments before we open it up to Q&A. First, we’re very pleased by the strong financial and operating performance and this is punctuated by both the strong internal revenue growth both in storage and service, the continued expansion of EBITDA margins which when combined with internal revenue growth gave us around 4% internal EBITDA growth in the first half. Our new information governance in digitization services are finding real resonance with our customers as they look to us in helping them manage a hybrid physical and digital world. This is visible both in our financial results as well as the partnership announced with Google. Finally, we continue to be a standout as a high-yielding investment which continues to grow AFFO and EBITDA in the mid to upper single digits fueling continuing dividend growth. With that, I’d like the operator to turn it over to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This morning’s first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I’d like to dive a little bit deeper into your progress of price volume optimization. Can you elaborate on what extent your increases in pricing has been implemented versus internal plans? And how over the next several years you expect to migrate the North American price increase strategy over to Europe?
William Meaney: Okay. Good morning, George. What I would say is it’s fully implemented and probably has been for about 12 months in North America. I’d say we’re more than halfway through mark in Europe but you’re just starting to see the results. And you can see that when you actually – it’s the monkey math in the sense that as you know that the internal revenue growth and internal volume growth are done on a slightly different basis, but you can get a feel for the difference between, say, Western Europe and North America in terms of how much the internal revenue growth is coming from price and how much is volume. Still in Europe we’re still getting a lot of the internal revenue growth from volume whereas in North America we’re getting it all from price. And over time what we’re driving for is again to get more and more of our internal revenue growth from price in these mature markets as we try to maximize the yield or the NOI that we’re getting on the assets deployed rather than having to add racking to drive internal revenue growth. So I would say in North America we’re pretty much there and we continue – and in Europe we’re probably a little bit more than halfway there and we continue to look at developed markets to deliver somewhere between, say, 3%, 3.5% of internal price improvement going forward as we roll that program out into Western Europe. If we look at the emerging markets, we have just recently established four pricing centers or revenue management centers in those markets because we don’t want to just leave chips on the table. But you can expect us to continue to be more cautious in those markets to be too aggressive with price because those are markets that typically with a few exceptions – there’s some locations in Latin America and in Eastern Europe where we’re very comfortable with our market penetration but there are other areas where we’re still building market share. But we have actually initiated four regional centers of excellence in terms of revenue management even in the emerging markets now.
George Tong: Yes, that makes sense. And as your pricing initiatives continue to get implemented, would you view this as a one-time step up in pricing or do you think it’s going to be a sustained lever over the course of several years? In other words, what’s the timeline of revenue lift or what’s essentially the timeframe of when you would expect the benefits to flow through from pricing and when would you expect that to normalize back down to low single digits or inflationary trends?
William Meaney: Well, we’re right now I think – we think that we have a pretty long runway to keep kind of that 3%, 3.5% if we’re looking just purely at developed markets. There was probably a little bit of catch-up because I think we are trending in the high – like the 3.5% to 4% at one point but we think the 3% to 3.5% in the current inflationary environment that we can continue to do that. So we feel pretty comfortable that we can get a little bit ahead of inflation in terms of the pricing and optimizing value for money that we’re providing our customers, especially as they’re coming to see us as a company that can support them on a number of fronts because the storage is just one part of the relationship between us and them. So they see – they’re actually even seeing more value that we provide from the storage part of the documents because of what we’re assisting them in doing on getting more revenue or insights from those documents going forward. So we feel pretty comfortable. It’s not kind of a one-and-done type thing that we can continue to drive in the developed markets that 3%, 3.5% annual price increase.
George Tong: Got it. Makes a lot of sense. And then lastly around services, the organic growth this quarter accelerated to 7.6%. Can you talk about whether there were any one-time benefits that occurred in the quarter or reasons why you might not expect that growth to persist going forward?
William Meaney: It’s a good point. I think we’ve called out a few times when it was kind of on the other side of the equation that especially as we go into more of the digitization project, which we’re really excited about, right. That’s also one of the reasons why we’ve established a partnership with Google. Those are going to be more lumpy, right. There is a recurring part of that especially the digitization projects that then rely on Iron Cloud to do the ongoing storage, so that would look more like a SaaS-type contract where there will be a recurring part of it. But there is many times a lumpy part of those contracts which is the initial digitization piece. So that is part of the thing that has driven that blip and that’s also why we – you’ll notice that I talked about it both the 7% plus that you’re referring to but also the 4% plus on the first half because there will be some movement back and forth. In addition to that, we did also have a very strong quarter on shred fueled partly by paper prices, partly because we’ve had some documents that have come off legal hold that are getting destroyed. So that fuels some of the – so I would consider that kind of a one-off destruction volume hit because of these documents that have come off legal hold. That’s not a usual occurrence. And then the other part is we obviously have won some new customers. So there are some one-off I would say aspects of even the shred business mainly around these legal hold documents but also you will see a little bit more movement up and down as these projects roll, even though that there’s a recurring aspect for both of these digitization projects.
George Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Bill, I’m going to go back to my gold and goose question. In terms of the revenue stepping up from pricing and looking at that with some of the volumes coming down, how are you kind of ensuring that you’re not killing the goose that laid the golden eggs in terms of – we saw the volumes go down? You mentioned legal aspect of that kind of a cliff. Maybe you can go into that a little bit more? And are we going to see the volumes come back towards – or hover around 0 plus or minus or should we really expect that in mature geographies we’re just going to see the volumes really just start to decline now?
William Meaney: It’s a good question, Shlomo. I wouldn’t expect you to ask any other questions. That’s fine.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: [Indiscernible] also by the way.
William Meaney: So coming around the goose, so the one thing – I think last time you and I spoke about it is I said, look, we are pushing price so there is always the potential to be some slowdown from existing customers. The one thing I was encouraged this time – and so we do watch that, right. To say that there was no elasticity out there is probably not fair, although I think there’s less and less elasticity going forward especially as we broaden what we’re doing for the customers across this kind of hybrid digital physical world. But specifically we were encouraged that if you look at new volumes from existing customers, that stayed steady from last quarter to this quarter. So I don’t think there’s a – there may have been a little bit of an impact but I don’t – it’s not getting worse. So I think that’s kind of flattening out. So I think that’s encouraging that we can continue to drive the type of price increases that we’ve been pushing through. Knowing that, yes, it may slow down that a little bit. The big difference this quarter was really around these legal holds and you can see that – in terms of the destructions, that’s kicked up. And just to give you, put some context on that, so the thing is we’re – on a trailing 12 months if we look just at developed markets because developed markets is where we see this trend that you’re describing, right, which are the more mature markets. So if I just look at developed markets, we continue to get in about 28 million boxes a year on an internal basis before acquisitions on a trailing 12-month basis and that’s staying pretty steady, so we think that’s really good. So we don’t see it drop off on what new is coming in. Historically – you’ve watched the starts a long time, we average about 20 million boxes of destruction a year that go out. And now we’ve seen this uptick which is driven mainly around legal hold which both before and after the GFC. So during that period of time where the uptick on a percentage term turns out to be 2 million or 3 million boxes of additional destruction on that 20 million base. And we think it’s going to take some time for that to wash through. So if you said to a net-net where that all leaves, we’re still kind of in the same guidance that we’ve provided last time as I think that we do expect the developed markets to be flat plus or minus on the zero. We still see especially with the federal government and some of the middle market which is going to be also lumpy how those things come in. We will have some quarters that are going to be on the positive. We’re going to have some quarters that are on the negative. If you ask me looking forward over the next 12 to 14 months that they were going to have more quarters on the negative side of zero than the positive side, we think it’s going to be kind of in that range. So we don’t see an acceleration in terms of the drop off. And so we feel very comfortable that we can continue to drive the kind of internal revenue growth even from the developed markets that we’ve been able to achieve.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: So we should see this improve? We should see that we’re going to go ahead and get volumes that are going to get closer to zero or even plus a little bit at some point in the next 12 to 24 months?
William Meaney: I think the next 12 to 24 months I think we’re going to be more in the negative side, but after that yes I think we’ll have some quarters that we’ll be in the positive column.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: So over the next one to two years we should expect this to be a negative trend?
William Meaney: I wouldn’t say negative trend. I would say it’s going to be at about the same trend if I’m kind of looking through these legal holds that are kind of flowing through and I’m looking through in terms of how our pipeline is building with some of the less penetrated areas of our business before, which is the middle market and the federal government, then I would say if you kind of looked through that, I think we’re going to kind of be in the same volume trends – not trends I would say but kind of the same volume levels that we’re seeing right now on a quarter-by-quarter basis but not trending negatively but kind of staying in that kind of range. So I think we’re going to be probably on the negative side of zero. But I do see as the destruction levels go back up to normalized trends and looking at the forward pipeline if you’re saying to me do I think there’s going to be some quarters that will also be on the positive side, yes.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: So if you kind of keep the volumes flat, what you’re saying is, is that after you comp on a way that makes the quarters go negative on a year-over-year basis but essentially you’re not accelerating the decline? Did I understand that correctly?
William Meaney: That’s correct.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And just if you look at the organic revenue growth on storage and like each market, except other international, the organic revenue growth, I’m not talking about volumes, just the revenue growth seems to have gone down a little bit lower than in the last four or five quarters. Is there something going on over there or how should we think about that?
William Meaney: Well, I think if you look developed markets, right, to your point it kind of – let’s just put it in the total, it comes out to I think around 2.3%. And then if you do the kind of – if you do on a monkey math in terms of if you take the volume, you take the revenue and you get like around 2.3%, 2.4% in terms of price that we’ve got and we normally are getting 3%, 3.5% in that growth. There were some one-offs that were from a comparison last year that kind of suppressed that comparison. So we’re still tracking in that 3%, 3.5% of price increase on an annual basis in the developed market. So we don’t actually see it trending down. There were some one-offs in Q2 last year that made that comparison look – again, monkey match acknowledging that volumes on a trailing 12-month prices on year-over-year or revenues on year-over-year. But if you do the monkey math you get to 2.3%. But if you kind of correct for that, we’re still kind of in the 3%, 3.5% range. So we expect that to continue to trend.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. I’m going to have to take that offline just because what I’m seeing is storage internal growth in NA RIM at 1.4% and then data management 0.7% and then 1.8% in Western Europe and each one of those is a decel?
Stuart Brown: Just to add on to what Bill said, there was – remember we’re cycling over a strong first quarter and NA RIM a year ago and there were some one-time benefits on an annualized basis, not a big number but impacted the second quarter by probably about 40 basis points. So actually you’re sort of – if you normalize for that you wouldn’t see the same trend you’re seeing.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And then just – the services projects are on one hand encouraging, the other hand they’re more volatile and George got into some little bit. I thought maybe you could talk about it a little bit more. Is there a portion of these businesses that we’re not just going to see a bunch of projects that go up and down, up and down? Is there a portion of these businesses that are going to really – or projects that will end up being recurring multiyear type of items that will bring the services business to strength on more of a regular basis?
William Meaney: Yes, that was what I was trying to highlight before is that there is kind of two aspects with a lot of these projects, not always but more and more especially since we’ve launched Iron Cloud. It is the part which is getting the information in digital format that they can either apply machine learning to or they can just taking physical documents and putting it into electronic documents. There’s a project aspect to that and that will continue to be lumpy. And then there’s the other aspect when they’re utilizing Iron Cloud, then that becomes more like a SaaS project. It’s an ongoing recurring revenue associated with that digital storage that we’re providing through Iron Cloud.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: So if you look at some of the projects that you have right now, are these going to be ongoing for several quarters or should we infer that if you had a really strong quarter like very often then we’ll see the next year, you have very tough comp or even the next quarter, it drops down because of that.
William Meaney: I think as we start up, you’re still going to see probably similar kind of lumpiness that you’ve seen historically, so I wouldn’t say that you’re going to see a major change in the next couple of quarters because the Iron Cloud we just launched in the last few months. So we’re just starting to get that, what I call that recurring base that comes from that aspect of it. But I’ll give you an example. We signed a market research company just recently which is a five-year contract which is just recurring revenue year-after-year-after-year, right, and we expect to renew after five years because it’s still going to need access to that data. But it’s going to take some time for the Iron Cloud to ramp which is the main part of the recurring. We do have some other projects that recur as well. But I think if you look at for the next few quarters, Shlomo, I think you’re going to see continued lumpiness.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Got it. And then I’m just going to leave off with this. It seems like the focus on data center, the capital is going there versus – or some reallocation from records management. Typically records management acquisitions have helped keep the volumes up as well. Is that going to kind of change the volume look on a go-forward basis as more of the capital is allocated through the data center side?
Stuart Brown: You’ll see more – I think we’ll be able to continue to deliver growth on the records management side. I think what you see from a capital discipline standpoint what we’ve done is we’ve gotten – we’re building less in advance before we’re building out racking sort of two to three years in advance on the storage side. So we’re able to continue to keep the records management growth. We may not be building out quite as much. So we’ve been able to take some of that capital, reallocate that to the data center business. And so as you’re taking the strong base that we have from EvoSwitch with a strong ongoing earnings revenue, take customers out of their existing data centers, expand them out. You’re seeing us get good preleasing on the development side, so we’ll continue to get earnings expansion from that and the strong capital returns. The capital returns from a racking is obviously the best returns and we’ll continue to allocate capital there as we have the opportunities. But the data center business I think longer term is really going to continue to create the most value for shareholders as you’re developing those assets at a low to mid-teens return in a business that’s got cap rates that are mid to upper single digits. So that creates a lot of value for shareholders.
William Meaney: And the only thing I would just add to what Stuart, Shlomo, on that is that it goes back to the pricing what we’re doing on yield management in developed markets. So if you look at North America for instance and you look at North America two years ago is our internal revenue growth was almost completely driven by volume. So we were adding racking to support that. Now we’re actually getting higher internal revenue growth out of North America and we’re doing that without any additional racking or nearly – almost no additional racking. We thought to add racking in a couple places but much less racking than we have to do to drive that. And you can see that in a chart that we introduced this time around looking at NOI growth in terms of our records management business is we’ve grown it not only on absolute terms but we also have grown it on a square foot basis. So we are getting much better yield also out of mature markets and that allows us where we had to spend money on racking before is to be able to reallocate that.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. Good morning. You’ve made several larger data center acquisitions with personnel from the different companies. I was wondering if you could touch on how integration in that line of business is going. And also any examples of cross selling the data centers to Iron Mountain storage customers?
William Meaney: Thanks, Sheila. It’s a great question. So first of all we’re really – I think I said this last time, we’re really pleased and we’re pleased with the assets that we have but we’re really pleased with the people assets. In fact, Mark Kidd had an offsite with his management team I think it was about 10 days ago that I went and spent a little bit of time with them. And the level of engagement, the expertise, the customer relationships that those folks have brought across both at IO and Eric for EvoSwitch, for instance, was in the room as well that he’s bringing in terms of strengthening our position in Europe is fantastic. So I feel really both fortunate the people that we were able to get as part of the acquisition and just the sense of their engagement, motivation and excitement of being at Iron Mountain because a number of them felt like they were capital constrained before we bought them because obviously their companies were getting ready for sale, et cetera. So I think the excitement is really good and the talent that we got is really good. I think where we’re continuing to work through on the integration, I wouldn’t say we’re all done on the integration. I think the people integration were pretty far along but we still have some operating systems that were still standardizing and integrating because obviously every time you buy one of these companies, they have their own operating system. So we’re still integrating across that. In terms of the cross selling, yes, we’ve seen it in both ways. So we have a relationship with pretty much, on the Iron Mountain side with all of the – almost all the large global financial service customers. And as a result of that, some of the data center folks have been able to expand their footprint using the Iron Mountain relationships in those financial service customers which they were unable to before. And on the other side even we’ve had cases where say IO was serving a bank but they didn’t have the northern Virginia location and we’ve already seen cross selling within the data center business of being able to take customers that we might have been serving in northern New Jersey, for instance, into our northern Virginia facility which has been also great in terms of retention of some of the sales folks that we’ve been able to get through these acquisitions because we’ve effectively given them more shelf space or more product on the shelf that they can sell. So we’ve seen revenue synergies, if you will, by just building the footprint and getting our sales people more product to sell by geographical expansion. And then we’ve also seen some relationships that we’ve had on the records management side that we’ve been able to facilitate so they can actually add new logos. So, so far it seems to be really positive.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, great. And then moving to the venture with Google, just to understand how that came about, does it require new employee hires for Iron Mountain and who is offering the marketing? Is Iron Mountain marketing this to their customer and Google is just the tech programming part? Just a little bit more detail how you expect this to unfold.
William Meaney: We’re excited about the Google partnership. So to me it’s kind of little bit the Reese's peanut butter cup, right. I don’t know who’s the chocolate and who’s the peanut butter. But I guess it depends on which you like. I like chocolate better so I’ll stick with the chocolate. But I think that it was one of these things where I think we were both looking at this. We continue to work with our customers and our customers continue to come to us especially as they go through their digital transformation on how we can help them in this hybrid digital and physical world. And because we have a lot of their physical content, we’ve been historically helping them digitize that and we have their trust. You were a natural person for them to come to. So we started looking at could we find a partner that would help facilitate some of the machine learning, because we’re not an artificial intelligence or machine learning company but we know how to actually ingest data, tag it and put it together in a way that actual machine learning can efficiently be applied to that and then store the results afterwards in a secure – both the cyber secure and from an intellectual property secure methodology. So we had actually independently started looking at this space. We’ve hired a number of people from the tech community. Fidelma Russo, as you know, that we brought over from EMC about 14, 18 months ago. She’s systematically recruited a team not just for this area but for a number of areas where we think technology can really drive new revenue streams for the company. So we’ve brought in a number of people that actually have developed what we call records management as a service, this product offering. At the same time Google has been looking at that space. And if you kind of look at – I think you have to ask Google but when I speak with Google, the reason why they were attracted to us really is kind of two levels. One is that we have such a deep trusting relationship with 950 of the Fortune 1000 and we truly are a B2B marketing and selling organization, which is slightly different than Google. The other thing is, is we have that trusted position and we have tons of data. So if you look at the medical records, for instance, we have 850 million medical records. Now it’s not going to be our decision to do this. This is our customers come to us and say they want to try to get more insight and do things faster and better in a more compliant way with their information. So when we have those opportunities, coming to your question who’s selling it? Iron Mountain is selling. And we put something together for the customer and transparently if the customer says, yes, we want to actually apply machine learning to that, Google as you know is one of the strongest machine learning artificial intelligence companies around and has the scale to actually do these type of applications on a global footprint, not just in the United States. So we’re really excited. It’s early days and as we say we’ll launch it in September. So we’ve already done proof of concepts in a couple of industry verticals and we were at Google next last week speaking about it and Google was also speaking about it.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, great. And one last quick one. In the supplemental there was a ratio on internal data center growth which was negative. Was that skewed by that lease termination fee that you mentioned in the year-ago period?
Stuart Brown: Right, exactly. There was a lease termination fee. SimpliVity paid a lease termination fee after they got acquired last year. It was about $4 million.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, perfect. Thank you.
Stuart Brown: Thanks, Sheila.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, Stuart, how much cost efficiencies are left in the transformation initiatives and the recall synergies? And what will drive margins forward past these two areas?
Stuart Brown: When you look at sort of our margin outlook and our 2020 guidance, you sort of get an ongoing call it up and down a little bit to sort of 60, 70, 80 basis point margin expansion per year. And so a piece of that is obviously continued efficiency improvements, some of those efficiency improvements will drop to the bottom line, some of that will continue to reinvest in back office improvements and the customer service initiatives – customer solutions that Bill talked about, so some of that will get reinvested. Obviously we get margin expansion as well from revenue management so that contributes to it as well. And over time as the data center business grows, that’s a higher margin business also. So that just from the mix standpoint will wake that up.
Andrew Steinerman: Right. And so Stuart I think you just answered the second part of the question on kind of past initiative, but about the first part. When you look at those two buckets, transformation and recall synergies, how much is left in those?
Stuart Brown: Yes, from recall we’ve got about $5 million to $10 million of synergies left.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay.
Stuart Brown: And most of that is coming from the real estate consolidation. Most of the benefits are flowing through what we talked about is the piece that would be trailing would largely be around the real estate consolidation just because it takes a little while to set that up.
Andrew Steinerman: Right. And then all your original transformation initiatives, is that ongoing or --?
Stuart Brown: Yes, we’ve captured most of that as well and that’s inherent in this year’s guidance already.
Andrew Steinerman: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Eric Compton with Morningstar.
Eric Compton: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two quick ones. One, just on data centers. So I’m looking at kind of Q2 the revenue per leasable square foot and per leasable megawatt compared to Q1 and I’m seeing kind of some trends up there. I’m wondering is that just the function of some of the mix change maybe adding Amsterdam now or is that like – is there something to that trend or maybe I’m reading a little bit too much into that? And then related to that, just maybe a little more color on your take of supply and demand what you’re seeing in the data center market pricing, anything along those lines?
William Meaney: Because we’re looking at a number of different markets, there is a mix issue. In other words, it depends on how much hyperscale, how much smaller colo and obviously retail has a different pricing per kilowatt. In terms of the trend, we continue to see – first of all, we are emphasizing on the top 20 global markets, top 10 in the U.S. and top 10 in international and those markets by their own definition have the highest absorption rate. So we continue to see very strong demand pipeline. You noticed that we announced the expansion of the Phoenix campus, for instance, with the first 24 megawatts being available by July next year, so about a year’s time. We do that based on the pipeline of commercial deals that we see coming in. So we really remain very bullish on the data center segment especially in these high absorption markets which we’re focused on.
Stuart Brown: And just to come back on the supplemental, when you look at that, the majority of that change is really the layering in of EvoSwitch during the quarter.
Eric Compton: Got you. Okay, that’s helpful. And last one for me just on the corporate and other segment, I know there is a lot of kind of moving parts in there. But I’ve got in my notes just – the goal is maybe 140 by 2020 if I’m reading this right. So I’m just curious, I know we had the art acquisition I believe was last quarter, so maybe any updates there as far as growth and what the – just kind of maybe an updated run rate there where future growth might come from in that segment?
William Meaney: You’re picking up the general right now, because what we’ve done is we’ve had that the art segment as you highlighted before and we this year have actually taken the entertainment services which used to be part of data management and we’ve put that together with art, because whist the – a number of the customers are obviously different is the way we go to market and the type of services that we offer whether it’s the entertainment services or the art market are very similar. So when you look at those businesses, they do tend to have growth rates that are on an organic basis in the mid to upper single digits. And we can see that consistently. And we’re also seeing – we’re getting some synergies on that. But we’ll provide more guidance as we go forward. But right now we’ve put it in the corporate segment because it’s actually still relatively small to the whole.
Stuart Brown: And the other thing to remember is Artex which is the art business that’s really been focused on the museums was acquired late – was closed late in the quarter and so that had very small impact. But that integration was going well already.
Eric Compton: Got you. All right, thanks, super helpful.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We have a follow-up question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Bill, I just want to see if you’d let me back in.
William Meaney: I always let you in, Shlomo.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Yes, I’m just kidding with you. I just want to ask, absent the data center acquisitions, would you still hit that 2020 plan in terms of margins?
William Meaney: I think we would be close because the way that the data centers – look, the data centers have a higher margin. Even when they stabilizes we say they’re kind of 55% let’s roughly margins. That being said, between now and 2020 because of the growth in the data center business if we’re not running that portfolio on a fully stabilized basis, over time you can expect that that’s going to give us more tailwinds behind our margin expansion. But between now and 2020 given the development pipeline, it may add a little bit but still the bulk of our growth is in the core business.
Stuart Brown: The only thing I’ll add, Shlomo, is that we did update the 2020 plan after we bought IO. We actually increased the margins at that time. So we had already made an adjustment for that.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: But I’m just saying if you go back and I looked back and all I could say the last Analyst Day that you guys had a 2020 plan. Are you getting back a little bit to what Andrew was asking, are you guys on track with the overall core business?
Stuart Brown: We’ll probably answer – if you look at the trends rates that we’ve been hitting and the benefits of the revenue management program, we probably would be exceeding those targets.
William Meaney: Yes, and you can see that in the results that we’re printing now. We’re actually continuing to grow EBITDA and this is – and a lot of the data centers not fully stabilized now. So it’s adding a little bit benefit but the bulk of the benefit is what we’ve been able to drive through the integration of recall, transformation and the general health of the business and then you layer on revenue management. So the bulk of the – coming back to the margin expansion, over time though I would say once you get beyond 2020 and every year as the data center business continues to go, obviously that’s going to just fuel the EBITDA margin growth even more.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. As there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to turn the call to management for any closing comments.
William Meaney: Thank you very much. Have a good weekend, everyone.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Melissa Marsden - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Kate. Hello, and good morning everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. The user-controlled slides that we will be referring to in today's prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations site along with the link to today's webcast. You can find the presentation at ironmountain.com under About Us/Investors/Events & Presentations. Alternatively, you can access today's financial highlights press release, the presentation and the full supplemental financial information together in one PDF file by going to investors.ironmountain.com under Financial Information. Additionally, we have filed all of the related documents as one 8-K, which is also available on the Investor Relations website. On today's call, we'll hear first from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain President and CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic plan followed by Stuart Brown, CFO, who will cover financial results. We also have Mark Kidd, General Manager of our data center business, joining the call today and available when we open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to page 2 of the presentation, today's earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2018 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. And the reconciliations to these measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Melissa, and hello, everyone. We are pleased to report a solid start to 2018 with another strong quarter of financial and operating results that demonstrate the durability of Iron Mountain storage rental business and continued progress against our 2020 strategic plan. The quarter's performance, as shown on page 3 of the presentation, is on track with annual expectations and punctuated by strong overall growth in total reported revenue of 11% versus the first quarter of last year, smooth integration of both IO and Credit Suisse data centers; continued strength in our core business with internal storage growth of 3.7%, at the high-end of our annual guidance, and another quarter well in excess of inflation, positive internal service revenue growth, and strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Including the increase in share count, AFFO grew 20% which supports our targeted dividend per share growth of 7% for 2018. Furthermore, we are pleased in delivering some of the best internal growth figures for the company in the last five years whilst the base upon which the growth is added to, has increased by about one-third. It should be noted that our acquisitions of IO Data Centers and the two data centers from Credit Suisse closed in the first quarter, therefore those companies' results are not included in internal revenue growth metrics until next year. Adjusted EBITDA growth of 17% for the first quarter was also in line with our expectations, reflecting strong margin expansion from a year ago, with some of the same revenue drivers and including the minor benefit associated with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standards discussed on our last call. Stuart will have more on this shortly. Our improved internal service revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by growth in our shred business despite lower year-over-year paper prices as well as expansion of our information governance and digital solutions businesses, which provides imaging and digitization services and an increase in special projects. We're excited by the pipeline of these projects, as our traditional customers increasingly see us as their go-to partner in managing their hybrid physical and digital information management needs. Overall, our core business continues to perform well with worldwide net volume growth of roughly 4 million cubic feet before acquisitions over the trailing 12 months. This supports the durability of storage revenue growth, as the average box of records in our facilities remains for 15 years. Revenue management continues to support momentum in developed markets, and we achieved a larger contribution from pricing in Western Europe than in recent quarters. In emerging markets, internal revenue growth is driven more from volume than pricing, as we build market leadership in those higher growth markets. As shown on slide 4, this consistent internal growth in our core business, together with the expansion of our data center platform and recent transactions in other adjacent businesses, should drive faster growth with improved margins over time and gives us confidence in achieving our 2020 goals. We are well on track to achieve a business mix delivering internal adjusted EBITDA growth above 5% before acquisitions by 2020, and this quarter is consistent with that progression, fueled by the 3.2% internal revenue growth. Moreover, given the recent data center acquisitions and recently announced pending art storage acquisition, our growth portfolio – which is emerging markets, data center, and adjacent businesses – are already approaching approximately 25% of our revenue mix. Turning to slide 5, we made further progress on the execution of our strategic plan. As you will recall, our plan is to extend our durable business model through continued nurturing of our core developed markets, expanding into faster growing emerging markets and growing our storage-related adjacent businesses, such as art and entertainment services, as well as data centers. And we will continue to find ways to enhance the core strategic pillars of our plan by identifying and evaluating opportunities to provide innovative solutions and services to new and existing customers. In developed markets, which include our North American Records and Information Management, North American Data Management and Western European segments, we achieved internal storage revenue growth of 2.9% even with a 0.5% decrease in internal records volume on a trailing 12-month basis, consistent with the guidance we provided on our February earnings call. Also as we noted last quarter, whilst our successful revenue management efforts may marginally impact the incoming volume from existing customers, it has not significantly impacted new customer behavior or customer terminations and destructions. Following our successful implementation in North America and early signs of progress in Western Europe, we are adding revenue management resources in certain emerging markets during 2018. Furthermore, we continue to achieve growth from existing customers through marketing the broad range of physical storage, digital storage, information governance and data management services. Additionally, we continue to focus on volume growth from further penetration of unvended segments, such as the mid-market and the U.S. federal government. We have seen increased demand to secure government records. In February, we hosted the grand opening of our 10th National Archives and Records Administration or NARA-compliant Federal Records center, adjacent to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, with more than 160 potential federal customers in attendance. This facility has a total capacity of 1.5 million cubic feet of record storage and is attractive to government agencies who are seeking to minimize their physical footprint and reduce their spending on record storage. In fact, we have already secured records from one federal agency that we expect will occupy 400,000 cubic feet of this facility once fully moved in by year end. During this quarter, we announced our plan to acquire Artex, a complementary art storage business to our existing Crozier Fine Art entity. This transaction will give us a more significant presence with important museum and institutional customers whereas Crozier has traditionally had a deeper presence with art dealers and galleries. This is an important acquisition from an industry perspective and we expect it to significantly strengthen our competitive position in key markets. Turning to our data center business, during the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of IO Data Centers, as well as Credit Suisse facilities in London and Singapore. The integration with the IO team is going very well, with special focus on bringing together the commercial teams. Whilst IO had limited availability of built-out capacity at acquisition, we are now developing additional capacity in Phoenix and New Jersey on top of new development in our Northern Virginia and Denver locations. The current development activity will add 18 megawatts of which 25% is pre-leased. You can see from our reported results for the data center segment, we are on track for annualized results of about $200 million of revenue this year and $100 million in adjusted EBITDA after normalizing for full quarter contribution from these two transactions. Driven by the acceleration of enterprise data center outsourcing to third-parties and attractive growth characteristics of the business, we may shift some of our growth capital towards data center opportunities for both smaller, targeted acquisitions, as well as development within our existing platform. Turning to emerging markets for our records management business, we continue to see solid internal growth as well as attractive acquisition opportunities. During the quarter we closed on transactions in South Africa and India and since quarter end, we closed on two additional tuck-in acquisitions in Dubai and South Korea, leveraging the scale and infrastructure we have in these markets. Our deeper penetration into these faster growing markets supports enhanced leadership and we expect to drive margins higher as we further our scale. On slide 6, I want to reiterate that we remain on track with our deleveraging and payout ratios for 2020, which assumes a 4% annual increase in dividends per share as shown in this depiction of our financial model. Stuart will address the progress we've made on our balance sheet, both in terms of leverage as well as interest cost shortly. Before turning the call over to Stuart, I'd like to remind you that whilst our year-to-date total shareholder return is down about the same percentage as the MSCI total return REIT index, it is important to recognize that with increasing interest rates often associated with inflation, we have the ability to pass through inflation-based rental rate increases on an annual basis. And we achieve meaningful flow-through on those increases, given the high margin characteristics of our storage business. This furthers our ability to deliver meaningful dividend per share growth, in not just nominal but real terms. More directly, our 75% gross margin storage business and ability to grow price in line with inflation helps us accelerate the growth of cash generation, well in excess of inflation. Additionally, we are today a standout in the S&P 500 in that we are a top yielding company that also has durable and growing internal growth, expanding margins, a solid balance sheet, and great long-term growth potential, both in our core, as well as data center and adjacent businesses. To wrap up, we are pleased with our solid results in the first quarter, supported by strong storage revenue growth and acceleration in the contribution from our faster growing portfolio. These dynamics are driving healthy growth in both the top line and in cash flow that ultimately supports our ability to continue to grow dividends per share and delever over time. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting on another strong quarter with robust rental revenue growth and enhanced margins. The team at Iron Mountain continues to make excellent progress against our financial and strategic goals, anchored by a disciplined investment strategy, focused on faster growing value-creating businesses, combined with continuous improvement in our core records management business. On today's call, I'll cover key highlights, certain operational and financial metrics and touch on our outlook for 2018, which is unchanged from February. Before diving into the details, let me walk you through the highlights. First, we achieved strong internal storage revenue growth of 3.7%, tracking ahead of the 3% to 3.5% annual guidance we laid out in February. This reflects solid underlying fundamentals and the benefits from our revenue management program. Note that our internal revenue growth has been calculated to exclude any impact of the new revenue recognition standard. However, the accounting change has some minor impact on reported storage and service mix. Second, we delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 14% on a constant dollar basis, with margins expanding 170 basis points compared to a year ago, reflecting the benefits of Recall synergies, our transformation initiative, flow-through from revenue management initiatives and the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Let's turn to slide 7 of the presentation, which shows our key financial metrics. Results were generally in line with or ahead of our expectations. Revenue came in at just over $1 billion growing 11% over last year and 8% on a constant dollar basis, driven by strong internal storage revenue growth from global net volume growth and revenue management, as well as the impact of our data center acquisitions. Internal service revenue growth ticked up, with a 1.4% increase, primarily as a result of our shred business and growth from imaging and project-related revenue. While service revenue can be lumpy depending upon the size and timing of projects, we are pleased with the progress this quarter. While the first quarter had a benefit from favorable currency translation on a year-over-year basis, exchange rates don't appear to be a tailwind for the rest of the year. In addition, current exchange rates are relatively consistent with the rates assumed in our guidance. Our gross profit margin improved by 160 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by labor synergies from the Recall acquisition and the flow-through of our revenue management program. SG&A as a percentage of revenue also improved slightly year-over-year on increased sales leverage. Compared to a year ago, our adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter increased more than 17% or approximately 14% on a constant dollar basis, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin increase of 170 basis points to 32.9%. Before providing color on the business segments, let me first touch on a few other points. First, adjusted EBITDA included a benefit of approximately $4 million from the revenue recognition accounting change. Also, our structural tax rate for the quarter was 19.5%, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.24 per share, flat compared to last year, but impacted by the increased depreciation and amortization, as well as increased number of shares following our recent IO and other data center acquisitions. AFFO was $222 million in the first quarter up over $50 million year-over-year, in line with the adjusted EBITDA increase. Maintenance CapEx and non-real estate investment totaled $23 million, up slightly from $21 million a year ago. Remember that these CapEx items increased in the second half of the year, leading to AFFO being more heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Turning to slide 8, in internal growth performance for the quarter, you can see the impact of our revenue management efforts reflected in Developed Markets' results, with internal growth nicely ahead of inflation. Almost half of our total revenue comes from the Developed Markets storage business, which had 2.9% of internal growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, internal volume growth in the Developed Markets records business was negative by about 0.5 point, as guided to on our last quarterly call on a base of over 500 million cubic feet in storage, as we cycle over strong growth from new customers a year ago. Internal service revenue in Developed Markets increased 1% or $3 million due to project activity and shred growth, slightly offset by lower average prices for recycled paper compared to a year ago. In Other International, where we are shifting more of our mix, we continue to see good storage internal growth of 5.6%. Service internal growth in this segment grew 4.4%. In other segments, the details of which are in the supplemental, the legacy Data Center business saw strong internal revenue growth of over 29% albeit off a small base. Turning to slide 9, adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter expanded in the North America records management business compared to a year ago, as we continue to benefit from the flow-through of revenue management programs and realized benefits from Recall synergies and our transformation initiative. In North America Data Management adjusted EBITDA margins were slightly down year-over-year, as we continue to invest in more new product development. As a reminder, this segment has been restated and no longer includes our entertainment services business, which is now included with Corporate and Other businesses. Margins in Western Europe expanded strongly on good cost controls and synergies while adjusted EBITDA margins in Other International were flat compared to a year ago. In the Global Data Center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins improved nicely, as we continued to scale the business. We expect margins over time to move closer to the mid-to-high 50% range, as we integrate the IO acquisition and add more scale to this business. During the quarter, we leased 1.5 megawatts of new or expansion space, primarily in New Jersey, Northern Virginia and Denver, as we kicked off a 4 megawatt expansion in Phoenix. Turning to slide 10, you can see that our lease-adjusted leverage ratio was 5.6 times at the end of the first quarter as expected, after having closed the IO Data Centers and Credit Suisse transactions. Our current leverage ratio is comfortably in line with other REITs, especially when considering that our business is more durable than many other REIT sectors. We expect to remain in this range for the year before reducing our lease adjusted leverage ratio to about 5 times at the end of 2020. As Bill discussed, we target the lower lease adjusted leverage ratio in order to give us more flexibility to seize opportunities. As you can see in the supplemental, the structure of our borrowings is appropriate to where we are in the business cycle. As of March 31, our borrowings were 73% fixed rate. Our weighted average borrowing rate is down to 4.8%, and our well-laddered maturity is at an average of 6.6 years. During the first quarter, we executed a new seven-year U.S. Term Loan B and swapped half to fixed for four years, for an all-in rate of just under 4%. With regard to guidance we remain comfortable with the outlook we laid out on our February call, so we've moved the details to the appendix for your reference. As a reminder, our guidance reflects the impact of the new revenue recognition standard to reflect the capitalization of commissions and initial intake costs. We now expect annual adjusted EBITDA to benefit from this new standard by about $15 million, down from the $25 million to $30 million we guided to previously. As a reminder this accounting change does not impact AFFO, cash flows or EPS as the increased amortization expense associated with the new standard offsets the increased EBITDA. This additional amortization expense plus amortization of customer relationship value for the data center acquisitions and the increase in depreciation of real estate acquired in the data center deals, will bring total D&A for the year to around $650 million. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we remind you that year-over-year growth in the second quarter will be impacted by cycling against the $6 million of one-time benefits associated with the write-off of an earn-out from a prior acquisition, and the termination fee earned in the data center business that positively impacted internal storage, revenue growth and EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA growth for the remainder of 2008 (sic) [2018] should be relatively steady from the first quarter just reported, consistent with full year guidance. With respect to financing plans, we expect to continue funding growth investments through a combination of cash from operations, debt, capital recycling from the sale of real estate, as well as potentially ATM issuances, depending on market conditions. We are currently planning to generate approximately $70 million late this year from the sale of three infill properties in Greater London, as we consolidate into existing facilities and a new Midland's record center, with the proceeds used to fund growth investments. On a full year basis, we expect to see continued growth in cash flow from operations as Recall related costs are largely behind us. As a result, dividend coverage will improve relative to cash flow from operations, providing more capital to fund growth investments. Finally, I'd like to touch on our longer term performance expectations. As you can see on slide 11, the framework is unchanged. On a compound annual growth rate basis, we continue to anticipate revenue growth approaching 7% from 2017 to 2020, adjusted EBITDA growth of almost 11% and AFFO growth exceeding 11%. With expectations of annual dividend per share growth around 4%, we expect an AFFO payout ratio in the mid-70s and our leverage ratio to be around 5x in 2020. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter, which reflects the strength and durability of our storage rental business. Our core business is fueling cash flow growth thereby funding investment to continue growth and enhance shareholder returns. We're excited about accelerating our growth as we expand Iron Mountain Data Centers, and are confident in the value we'll create for shareholders over time via the platform we continue to build. We remain well-positioned to deliver on our near and long-term financial projections, and I believe our stock represents a compelling investment given our current yield and favorable growth prospects. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we open it up to Q&A.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Stuart. And just a few comments, first of all, we are pleased to have delivered amongst our best growth figures in the past five years, with 3.7% internal storage growth, EBITDA growth of 17%, AFFO growth of 30%, or 20% adjusted for the increased share count. And our data center business is now firmly established to become a significant contributor over time. All this, we feel makes us a stand out from an investor standpoint. With that operator, I'd like to turn it over to questions.
Operator: The first question is from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC: Hi. Yes. Good morning. You did guide in the first quarter to expect storage volume down given a tougher comparison. I'm wondering if you could give us some insights on your outlook for the balance of the year. And on a related note, you have had some wins in the federal business domestically. I'm just wondering when you think we might see the benefits of those transactions in the volume numbers.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: All right. Good morning, Sheila. So it's a good question. I think, our guidance from here forward is that we expect Developed Markets to be kind of the plus or minus roughly 0.5%. So I'm not going to predict what that's going to look like quarter by quarter, but I think, we're going to stay in that kind of zone. And that's consistent with our trade-off that we decided to do. If you think about it this way, minus 0.5% it's roughly around $5 million to $7 million of negative revenue headwind. And on the other side, from a revenue management standpoint, we're achieving if you do kind of the monkey math, we're achieving something like a 4% revenue or price increase is we're contributing about $50 million on the other side. So I'll take that trade any time especially in a mature market where we're not going for additional share in existing customers. So I think that the tradeoff that we're making quite purposefully is $50 million to the good on one side knowing that we're taking some risk around volume which is on a 0.5% is probably costing us $5 million. And if you then take out the costs associated with that over time, it's about probably a $4 million or $5 million drag on the business. And the pricing goes straight to the bottom line. And we see that trend continuing out into the future. Some quarters it'll be positive, some quarters it'll be negative, but we think that's the right trade. I think when it comes to the upside on it, as you point out, is some of the unvended area and the largest of the unvended is the Federal Government. So the addressable market of the federal government is about almost the same size as our total North American business. We have made, I would say, steady progress and it is making an improvement, but it's not moving the needle at this point. I just went to the opening that I referenced in my opening remarks down at Joint Base Andrews. And just by the interest by the Federal Government on that, I think it will start gaining momentum as people start seeing this as not a risky thing, but a normal thing to do to outsource some of their records management. And we find a lot more interest and support from the federal agencies. But it's making a impact today, but I wouldn't say it's moving the needle yet.
Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. And as a follow-up, on the data center business, could you talk about how the IO integration is going, and any insights on your expectations or programs you're putting into place, cross-selling that business with your other customers?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So let me answer it at a high level, then I'm going to ask Mark Kidd to actually comment it on more directly. So I personally couldn't be more pleased in terms of the way it's going, especially from the human capital integration. So I think we said when we did the acquisition we expected to pick up and aim to retain a large portion of the human capital from the IO acquisition and, touch wood, that seems to be going extremely well. So I'm very pleased with that. The other thing that's interesting – and Mark will give you – and then I'll turn it over to Mark and have him give you more flavor, is in terms of your cross-selling aspect, as you know, Sheila, that before we did the acquisition, over 60% of our revenue in data centers were from historical existing Iron Mountain customers which are 950 of the Global 1000 companies. That's gone down a little bit with the IO acquisition, and Mark will correct me, I think it's in the 40s which I see as a good thing because we've picked up a number of new logos which gives us opportunity to cross-sell in both directions. So the first thing is yes, we absolutely do cross-sell. I was with a large financial institution with one of the IO salespeople a couple months ago in New York City, and that was a customer that we had a long established record with on a number of areas, both as a buyer of their services and provider services to them. And that definitely is making a difference that I hear from the IO sales team in terms of getting even bigger share with these guys. But on the other side, I do see our opportunity to sell to companies that we hadn't been servicing, before that IO had serviced. So Mark, you may want to comment further in terms of how the integration is going.
Mark Kidd - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Absolutely, Bill. The integration has been progressing extraordinarily well. As Bill mentioned we've been very impressed to-date with the human capital, the teams and their relationships that they have with their customers. We've made very good progress overall on the cost programs that we had previously discussed in terms of identifying those and beginning to act on those which we're very confident in the numbers that we had discussed. On the commercial side, we've already had wins from our existing customers [Technical Difficulty] (00:29:56-00:30:08).
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think – hey, Mark, I think you're – unfortunately Mark's actually out with the IO team. So he's not in the conference room. Mark, I think you probably need to dial in. So we can come back to it, Sheila. Mark, why don't you try dialing back in on the bridge?
Mark Kidd - Iron Mountain, Inc.: My apologies.
Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. Thank you so much.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Sheila.
Operator: The next question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You indicated you're adding resources to your revenue management program in certain emerging markets. Can you elaborate on your overall progress in optimizing the pricing structure in storage and how many more quarters you believe pricing growth will remain elevated from historical levels?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, George. Yeah, it's good question. So, yeah, I think last quarter, I commented that there was probably a mix of catch-up and continue. I think now the results that we're starting to see come through. So as I said, if you do the monkey math in developed markets, we're getting a little over four points of revenue growth. I think we're going to see continued, I would say, between 100 basis points and 200 basis points of real price increase, in other words over inflation in the Developed Markets for the foreseeable future. I don't see a change in that. And we're delivering probably at the high end of that range. We're probably delivering a couple hundred basis points, maybe a little bit more in terms of what I'd call real price increase. And I don't see a big slowdown in that in terms of the Developed Market. So, I think, we have kind of lapped, what I would call the catch-up and now, that kind of 100 basis points to 200 basis points of real price increase over inflation, I think is sustainable. I think in terms of emerging markets, it's all upside. So Emerging Markets, we have rolled it out. I think it's now to four locations or during 2018, I think, we're rolling out to four locations. When I say four locations, four regions, but with specific countries in focus for the emerging markets this year in 2018. And so, we will start rolling it out. But we're growing at a deliberate pace in the emerging markets because the Emerging Markets is a place where we're still building share and not optimizing the business, right. So you can expect that we will get more and more traction in emerging markets, but we're proceeding with a little bit more deliberate pace in those areas because of the share gains that we still have targeted.
George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Very helpful. And then, you're planning to direct more resources to drive organic and inorganic growth in the Data Center business. Can you discuss how your expansion in data centers broadly will alter your longer-term margin profile and capital raising requirements?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Well, if you think about it right now is that we already said that you'll see even a change this year because you could see the margins that are flowing through, approaching 50%. And as Stuart said, we expect that to kind of, on a stabilized basis, to be in the mid-50, 55% to the upper-50s range. You can already see that we've made a step change since the acquisition of IO, Credit Suisse and FORTRUST because it's really given us a scaled platform. So you already see that. And for this year, for instance, it'll be pretty much around 50%. So we've guided that would be about $200 million of revenue and $100 million of EBITDA. Now if you see, we roughly have about 120 megawatts roughly at the end of this year in terms of capacity or after the acquisition of IO, I should say. And we have a total of 250 roughly of megawatts of capacity on what we already have in the family, so to speak, in terms of real estate land or shell that can be built in terms of what we have. So you can see that there's still a very – it's almost a doubling of our current business that we can actually build without doing another acquisition. So that would be what I would call more organic growth. I think just to be clear is that we do continue to look at places to expand, but think of that much more on greenfield, brownfield like a Credit Suisse deal or a small tuck-in. And we continue to – as we have over the last few years, as we continue to monitor what I would say the top 20 global markets, about half of those outside the United States, half of them internally. And we do see the external ones really interesting for us, because this is where we can use our D&A as a company, because we are by far the most global of any of the REITs not just the data center REITs but just REITs in general and we're in 53 countries and we have been there for a very long time. So if you think about the ability to cross-sell, our ability to actually build local scale in some of these countries, we think that our ability to actually find the right acquisitions, and drive through synergies both on the top line and the bottom line internationally is kind of a unique – it's a unique proposition that Iron Mountain has in the data center space. So it's not when we talk about looking to expand to cover the top 20 markets, it's not just domestically, it's internationally I think has a certain amount of attractiveness to us.
George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi good morning. This is Michael Cho for Andrew. My question is just around EBITDA margins and I guess margin expansion. Can you just provide a little bit more color on the cadence of the margin or margin expansion for the remainder of the year, just in terms of gross profit or SG&A just given where first quarter margins were and full year guidance?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. If you look at sort of the first quarter performance obviously very strong, we do expect to continue to have some revenue flow through. The EBITDA margin expansion that we've guided to for the year isn't as strong. We expected more in the first quarter. So the overall guidance we feel quite comfortable with the expansion that we've got built into that. Again, from a margin standpoint, the point we just touched on, you will get a little bit of impact from the data center business and the storage gross profit margins but overall EBITDA is right on track with guidance.
Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. And can you just remind us how much of the Recall and transformation cost efficiencies have not been actioned yet?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Almost everything has been actioned. The only thing that's really out there still to be actioned – and the activity we have going on this year is there's a couple of countries that we're still doing consolidation on that had some regulatory hurdles to get those started, so those are all in process now, as well as back office systems. Those are all being actioned and will be largely completed this year, particularly around HR and finance. And then we still have some real estate opportunities and consolidation is what we've always said would sort of be the later pieces of that to flow through, just getting leases lined up and things like that. So you're seeing some of that flow through and that'll continue on. But the vast majority of the Recall costs will be done by the end of the year.
Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you. I want to go back to a question that was asked earlier just in terms of volumes and expectations for the rest of the year. Hey, Bill, I understand what the company is trying to do between pricing and volume, but the investor concern is that the company is not kind of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. And I just want to ask, like if you're seeing the change in investor behavior that's impacting volume right now, what gives you confidence that you're going to see the volumes change to go from negative 5% to sometimes be as much as plus 5% and that we won't just be on a sustained downward trajectory in this area, because clearly it seems like it is a result of the pricing actions. If you could just elaborate on that a little bit?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Well, no, it's a good question, Shlomo. So just to be clear, that's why we call it revenue management and not just pricing, is we do monitor the elasticity that we're playing with extremely closely so that we won't let that happen. The great thing is – if I flip what you're saying, it's self-inflicted. In other words we can control it. So to me this is we're not going to kill the goose. And the other thing is we are also very careful and not about destroying customer relationships. So if you think about it, what we're talking about is a little bit over 4% price increase, right, we're not talking about 24% price increase. These customers are also important for us for our digital services. So our biggest pipeline right now is in information governance and digital services in absolute terms is our biggest pipeline. And that pipeline is primarily with people that we're serving on the physical storage business. So we don't want to damage those relationships. So it's not just the elasticity when we look at what's happening to volume. We don't look just on the elasticity on the physical business, we also look at its impact for us to sell end-to-end solutions with them. So we are very cognizant of it and as you point out, the great thing is it's in our control. So if we feel like we're pushing it too far, we'll pull it back. But if you said to me, do I think we can continue to have these kinds of real price increase, yeah, I think, right now we're probably north of the 200 basis points of real price increase that I just mentioned, but I think I'm very comfortable even with the caution that you're making that we can maintain 100 basis points to 200 basis points of real price increase because it's in our control.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Why would volumes go up if you're seeing this happen like you said, hey, we'll see – we're down minus 50, will you expect it to fluctuate between minus 50 and plus 50? What would make those volumes go up, would you have to pull back on pricing, or is there something else that would happen that just in the course of your business that will make the volumes go up?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's a couple things, so it's not – pricing, as you point out, affects part of it, part of it, don't forget what we're talking about, is 0.5% on a 500 million cubic foot business, right? So it's very small volumes that we're talking about on a relative size. So you can have a large customer that might have been on legal hold for instance that is doing some catch-up in terms of destruction during that period of time. And that can affect the numbers on a quarter-by-quarter basis as well. So it's not just pricing. So those are the things that kind of the ebbs and flows. And then some of the government contracts, I referred to the 400,000 cubic feet that we won from this one government contract which will get moved into a facility in less than a year. Those are kind of large contracts which can sway the numbers. So we think it's going to be plus or minus. We're probably, being frank, we'll probably have more that are on the negative side of zero than the positive side of zero over the next I would say 12 to 24 months. But that's what we expect.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then just going back to government contract, we've been hearing about government for like five to seven years. Are we at the point that you think this is going to be accelerating and this will be kind of a constant discussion that this is one of the untapped markets in the U.S. that's actually starting to open up to you. Is that just something you're anticipating?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Well, the only thing – you live closer to our nation's capital than I do, Shlomo, so you tell me. But anyway, no, look, the thing that I'm always careful about not committing to something I can't deliver because I don't want you to kind of throw it back at me because I like to do what I say I'm going to do. And I think I've been consistent to say I absolutely think the federal business will be a big business, I think I used to say 10 years. So now, I guess, I have to take a year or two off of that and say 8 years and I still stand by that, but I can't tell you when that eight years is going to happen because trying to predict how the Federal Government behaves is beyond my pay grade. So I do believe in the interest that I see and just the logic, right, I mean it makes no sense for the federal government to be doing this in house. And I think that more and more of the federal agencies understand that. But things don't happen quickly, right. So if you come back in eight years from now, I think I'd would be true to my word but I can't tell you within that eight years what I'm going to be able to have the proof point for you.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Justin Hauke of Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning. So I have a two-part question. The first one is just to clarify. I think you said that there might be a shift in the overall M&A investment, the $150 million more of that moving towards the data center side, so I just want to understand if I heard that correctly and if there's any change to the growth investment figure that you gave of $185 million?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. It's a good question. So Justin, just on that point, so think of it this way, go back to our 2020 slide, where we said 30% of our sales – we're already at 25% or just about 25% of our sales are in the what I would call the high-growth segment, which is Adjacent Businesses and Data Centers, right. And we said we're going to be 30% of that mix by 2020. And then, the main thing is your EBITDA. And that's all about getting to our EBITDA organic growth of 5%. And we're comfortably above the 3.5% that we needed to hit by actually the end of 2018. We're already there in the first quarter. So then you say, how do you get from here to there, and all I'm saying is that – and you're right to point out that $150 million of M&A, which we said traditionally is earmarked for emerging markets is we're now – now that data center is firmly established, we're looking at our high growth segments in one bucket. And we're saying what's the best capital allocation decision on that, consistent with our also stated objectives remain true to our financial model that Stuart went through, which is that deleveraging over time, bringing down the payout ratio of AFFO. So that's all part of our capital allocation decision. So what I was kind of foreshadowing is that we're putting that in one bucket. I can't tell you right now that we're going to make a change, but now when we look at those investment decisions, we look at it across that portfolio, consistent with driving 5% EBITDA, organic EBITDA growth by 2020, which will be fueled by roughly a 30% portfolio of fast growing businesses.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it, okay. That's what I thought, I just wanted to make sure that it's – so it sounds like it's an all-encompassing bucket now, as opposed to some incremental growth investment. So okay that makes sense and then I guess second part of the question is just for the balance of the year, obviously seasonally your maintenance CapEx is always low in the first half, so you have more in the second half, you've got the growth investments. With the leverage expected to hold at this level, how are you thinking about financing the remaining investments, is that through the ATM or are there more asset sales to come beyond the $70 million that it sounds like you incrementally announced this quarter?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: One thing that's important to remember right is a lot of the assets that we're buying be it acquisitions in emerging markets, or Credit Suisse, these are yielding assets. So it's not unproductive. So you're getting the EBITDA off of it. So you can fund it with debt and still be leverage-neutral in most cases. So you can expect us to continue to sort of like we've done with IO and with Credit Suisse to partially fund, from those cases, with equity and debt. But in other cases in terms of the development pipeline which is what you really see sort of more capital going to this year as we put in place a development pipeline, call it – we've talked about $185 million that that can be funded with other asset sales or organic EBITDA growth, as well as in some cases incremental borrowings and then the capital recycling.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, and just to answer your question on the ATM, so the plan that we laid out today and the guidance that we provided is without any ATM.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. Right.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great, okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.
Ryan Cybart - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Hi, good morning. This is Ryan Cybart on for Karin. So the topic of de-REITing under the new tax regime has been in the headlines again. Third Avenue argued in a letter to its investors that de-REITing could be an interesting option for companies with capital needs, so they're trading at big discounts. Just hoping you can update us on your thoughts around that.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: No. I mean, the REIT structure continues to provide a tremendous amount of value. If you look at where the core of the cash flow and the earnings comes from in the record management business in North America, we continue to get substantial benefits from the REIT structure and don't anticipate that changing even with the new tax regime. And we get some benefit from the new tax regime, obviously on the TRS side particularly, in the shred business where we'll be paying lower taxes on that side of it.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: And you think of it this way also, just if you just look at our AFFO this quarter on an adjusted share basis which was up 20% and if you think about – and that was in a period where we're growing the business and we had just grown the dividend, you kind of go this – we're an income-oriented stock, so why wouldn't you be a REIT? Because from our standpoint because of the margins in our business is we can walk and talk at the same time. In other words, we can grow the business, we can grow the dividend and return cash to shareholders. So maybe we're unique because of the high margin and high cash flow of our business, but makes sense.
Ryan Cybart - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay, great. And just wondering if you guys had any progress on the hiring of a senior leader for your data center platform?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: We have a senior leader for our data center platform actually. It may sound like we didn't because he had a hard time getting on the bridge. He's actually with his team out in Phoenix right now. So Mark Kidd is our leader. You're right that he's in the process of hiring a number of leaders on his team. But no, we have a leader in our data center business.
Ryan Cybart - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Eric Compton of Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Eric Compton - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A real quick one for me, just big picture. I understand your kind of optimal range right now for your at least adjusted net debt to EBITDAR is kind of that 4.5 to 5 range, and I'm wondering just longer term if you would be like comfortable getting closer to around 4.5, maybe even below it or if maybe just conceptually you view that as suboptimal for some reason. Just curious on kind of your longer term thoughts there.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, I think the short answer is, is that where our leverage is relative to our covenants, we're comfortable where we are today. So – and that's post the acquisition of IO, so we want to get leverage down to your point to the 4.5 to 5 times to create capacity on our balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities that could come up, either an acquisition or some dislocation in the market. And so if you sit down and do any type of theoretical cost of capital analysis, you'd come up also with that same sort of 4.5 to 5. So there's no reason today that you wouldn't say does it make sense sometimes to ever go below 4.5, maybe, but I think it would be unlikely. I think we'd find plenty of capacity in the balance sheet at the range.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, and if you think about it today, Eric, if you look at it is that as Stuart said – Stuart and his team did and our treasurer did a great job in terms of the recent issuance; it was sub 4%. So the debt holders absolutely get the nature of the company. I wish the equity holders would get it as well as the debt holders. But they see this as really a near investment grade or even priced at investment grade many times. So it's not about where we are now. And if you look at it relative to the REITs, people typically look at it through a C-corp, because that's how they graded the company before. If you look at it through a REITs, it's not – our leverage is actually right in line, but it comes down to – it's much more about headroom between covenants that we're trying to get to through the opportunistic reasons that Stuart outlined. So that's why we are deliberate, we are going to delever over time and we feel very comfortable we're well on track with the 2020 plan which will then naturally deliver us to that 5 range. And then we'll continue delevering from there. And so we'll do it deliberately but we're not going to do it in an unstructured way because there's no need to.
Eric Compton - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): All right. Thanks.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, thank you for squeezing me back in. Bill, we don't hear much about middle market anymore and it was always historically pointed to as this large under-tapped opportunity. And you've made some acquisitions there in the past and some of the capabilities and Recall were supposed to be there. Is there anything going on there of note, or what should we be thinking about in terms of potential for volumes over there?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, and I should update you in terms of the exact share. I think the last time I checked I think we're up to about 14%. I think when we started this journey, we were at 10%. So we've added four points of share in that and you can even kind of start seeing that in the mix of verticals versus – which are typically large enterprise customers versus the non-vertical. So we are making progress but it's obviously slower than I would like. But the sales teams are really doing a nice job. And I think as I said before, is we got some boost, we really – we probably went from 10% to 11% if I remember right when, before we did the Recall, and the 11% to 14% is just since Recall because our head of sales, as I mentioned before, is the former head of sales for Recall in North America. And he's done a very nice job restructuring part of the sales team to focus on it. It's just not as fast as I would like, because, as you rightly point out, is we have north of 50% market share on the enterprise and the middle market is the same. It's actually a little bit bigger than the enterprise market in terms of total absolute addressable market. So I keep saying to our guys, when are we going to get our fair share. So we're making progress but more to be done.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: The other thing I'll add in too is, you do see our North America team pursuing sort of a mid-market strategy in smaller markets, which is where a lot of these businesses are based right. So whether it be a hub-and-spoke system where they're moving out to sort of smaller cities outside of major cities and doing a store front and then storing the boxes in the facilities in major cities or creating smaller facilities to serve launching customers and then growing off of that. And we've seen some good success there both on revenue growth, although it's still a small base but some really positive signs.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So is there anything that you're expecting any change or is this really just in light of what's going on in the data center and the focus of the company with its capital over there, middle market is in the same kind of focus that it used to be within this company?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: No, it's actually – in fact I just authorized putting in a bunch more sales people. And it's minor investments. It's more getting people out, beating the street and partly, as Stuart said, it's getting people into geographical territories that they weren't hunting before. So look the gestation period anyway for our business isn't overnight, especially since some of the middle market is already vended, so you're actually also have that as a stickiness. But we're not taking our eye off of it. It's just happening slower than I would like.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes.
Operator: The next question is a follow up from Sheila McGrath of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC: Yes. Just two quick follow-ups. Service revenue growth was surprisingly strong at 1.4% just is that an aberration? How should we think about that? And then, the second is, if Mark's on the line could give us any additional insights that he thinks worth noting the data center business in terms of integration and cross-selling, that would be great.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. We'll give Mark Kidd another shot. He's dialed back in on here. And before I turn it over to Mark, Sheila, so I think, that the – it's not an aberration, but we're very pleased at the internal service. There are some one-offs in there like there always are. And I think Stuart mentioned the lumpiness of it because if you go back to our information governance and digital services business, which today is not huge, it's probably about $100 million worth of revenue. But that business is growing double digits and has our largest absolute pipeline of any business. So if you said to me, do I feel that we're going to be on the north side of zero rather than the negative side of zero, which we have been in the last couple of years, I think, in the drag, remember the other side of that equation is slower transport or slower use of transport in our core records business and data management business. I do feel that the growth now in information governance and digital services and our shred business is picking up the slack. So I don't think it's an aberration. Can I say that next quarter is going to be at 1.4%, remember we're guiding for the full year to be relatively flat. But I do expect that we're going to keep this through the course of the year in the positive territory as the information governance and digital services comes through.
Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC: Great. Thanks.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, yes.
Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC: Mark.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Mark, yeah. Sorry. Mark?
Mark Kidd - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Just confirming, can you hear me now?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes, we can.
Mark Kidd - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay, great. So I apologize for that before. Yes, on the data center integration in the business with IO, as Bill mentioned, we've been very, very impressed with the team and the human capital at the IO locations. They've been a great addition to the overall franchise. And so we've been working very closely with them on kind of building out the platform, advancing the commercial activity and also making sure we deliver on kind of the synergy elements that we had originally announced with the deal. So, on the costs side, we've made very good progress on putting the majority of those actions into place which will flow through the balance of this year as we had talked about. And on the commercial side, we've already seen a number of cross-site wins between our legacy portfolio and that which we brought on with the IO team, initially some smaller deals, but very good customer activity across both. And the other impact we've seen which is a big plus is that the Iron Mountain Data Management team's engagement given now that we have a larger portfolio across the country and even with Credit Suisse internationally. Their contribution to the overall pipeline has had a meaningful uptick over the last three months as well. And so I think, in aggregate, we are excited about the deals we've closed already. We do have full sales force integration across teams at this point from comp, quota, all the normal things that you expect and we see both actual results and pipeline results building nicely.
Sheila McGrath - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. Thank you.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Sheila.

With that, Bill, would you please begin?
Bill Meaney: Thank you, Melissa, and hello, everyone. We are pleased to report a strong finish to 2017, characterized by significant progress against our 2020 strategic plan, with solid momentum in the business and durable internal storage revenue growth clearly demonstrated in our fourth quarter results. Moreover, the acquisition of IO Data Centers coupled with Fortrust earlier in the year, provides us with the platform that will not only deliver our 2020 goals for Adjacent Business growth, but also drive higher and sustainable growth. As shown on Slide 3, we are well on track to having a business mix that will structurally deliver north of 5% EBITDA growth before acquisitions, up from about 3.5% as of the end of 2017. Turning to Slide 4. Full year revenue growth of 9% was slightly above our expectations. And adjusted EBITDA was in line with our outlook, up 16% over 2016, driven by strong internal growth, Recall synergies, transformation and a full year of contribution from Recall. This strong performance represents a 180 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins over 2016 and 220 basis points of improvement over the past two years despite the integration of Recall, which had historically lower margins than stand-alone Iron Mountain. In addition, AFFO for the full year was up more than 12%. Our strong 2017 performance benefited from favorable currency translation after three years of FX headwinds. For the fourth quarter, our results reflected continued strong internal storage rental revenue growth across the business. We achieved internal storage rental revenue growth of more than 4% in Q4, whilst internal service revenue growth was essentially flat, as expected, at minus 0.1%. In total, internal revenue growth was 2.5%, our strongest performance in the last 12 quarters. This healthy growth was supported by ongoing revenue management progress, primarily in North America, and continued worldwide net volume growth prior to the inclusion of acquisitions. We continued to generate positive net volume with seven million cubic feet globally before acquisitions over the past 12 months. This supports the durability of storage growth. And importantly, every one of these boxes is effectively in annuity for the next 15 years as new records stay with us on average for that length of time. We also made significant progress on the execution of our strategic plan.  As you will recall, our plan is focused on extending our durable business model through continued nurturing of our core developed markets, expanding into faster-growing emerging markets and growing our storage-related Adjacent Businesses such as art and entertainment services as well as data centers. We are doing this whilst capturing new service opportunities to provide innovative solutions to new and existing customers.  We have a robust outlook for 2018, reflecting continued successful execution against our 2020 strategic plan, and Stuart will have more details shortly. Slide 5 is a review of highlights related to our strategic plan. In developed markets, which include both our North American RIM and Western European segments, we achieved internal storage revenue growth of 3.4%, with modestly positive internal volume growth on a trailing 12-month basis. As noted last quarter, internal storage revenue growth in North America and increasingly, in Western Europe, is driven by revenue management rather than by organic volume growth. It is important to note that whilst our successful revenue management efforts may marginally impact the incoming volume from existing customers, it has not significantly impacted new customer behavior nor has it caused an increase in customer terminations or destructions.  Given our successful implementation in North America, we plan to add revenue management resources to Western Europe and Asia, Latin America, Australia and Eastern Europe during 2018. Furthermore, we will continue to seek growth from existing customers through revenue management programs and sales of services, and we will focus on volume growth from further penetration of unvended customers such as those in the mid-market in the U.S. federal government segments. An example of the potential from the U.S. federal government can be seen from our press release last week reporting that we secured a records management win with the U.S. federal prison system. It can sometimes take 12 months or more to inbound records from the federal segment, therefore, this volume as well as that from the U.S. Patent Office awarded late last year are not yet reflected in our reported volume. Looking at our goal to expand to the faster-growing emerging markets, they now represent more than 18% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis, almost double the relative size from about four years ago. Our progress against this goal was supported by emerging market acquisitions closed during the year totaling more than $87 million, which we purchased at a weighted average multiple of seven times stabilized EBITDA. Notable among emerging market deals in 2017 were: acquisition of the remaining portions of Santa Fe in South Korea, the Philippines and China; our entry into the Middle East; transactions in Peru, in Cyprus; a small shredding business in South Africa purchased from Stericycle; and a transaction in India that moved us into the market-leading position.  We continue to have a strong pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities in emerging markets and are pleased with the progress we’re making to deepen our presence in key growth markets that continue to experience strong, high-single digit internal storage growth.  Given our acquisition of IO Data Centers, we have begun breaking out our data center business as a separate reporting segment. Note that IO closed in January, so it is not reflected in our reported figures for Q4 or 2017. In addition, we have removed entertainment services from our North American Data Management segment and combined it with art storage as the nature of the storage assets and customer bases for these two businesses are more similar.  With the acquisition of Bonded Services in Q4, we expect to see improved synergies in the entertainment services business. The quarterly data for 2017, consistent with the new segmentation, can be found in the appendix to the supplemental.  Turning to Slide 6 in our data center business, we took a major transformative step towards shifting our business mix to faster-growing segments with our acquisition of IO for approximately $1.3 billion which closed in January. IO Data Centers substantially extends our existing data center platform and provides expansion capacity in the high-growth, high-absorption market of Phoenix as well as the strategically important market of New Jersey.  Phoenix is a very attractive market where co-location and cloud providers have made significant investments over the past few years. It has diverse energy sources and relatively inexpensive green power as well as attractive business environment and was the fourth highest U.S. market in absorption last year. New Jersey also is a critical market for our data center portfolio given the importance of the New York metro area to our global financial services customers.  The IO purchase represented a 15 times EBITDA multiple on a post-integration basis, including synergies of about $9 million. This multiple compares favorably to recent public and private market transactions, many of which do not provide the same growth outlook.  IO’s high-margin business is poised for significant growth, including partial synergies, and importantly, 95% of the forecasted EBITDA is already contracted. The IO deal follows our acquisition of Fortrust and the opening of our greenfield expansion into Northern Virginia in September. In addition, we plan to close on the purchase of two Credit Suisse data centers in London and Singapore in the first quarter.  In aggregate, we expect these data center acquisitions to be modestly accretive to AFFO in 2019, including the impact of shares issued to finance the IO deal and ATM issuances for the Credit Suisse transaction. For 2018, we expect the data center business to generate approximately $200 million in revenue and $100 million in normalized EBITDA.  We believe these acquisitions will create real value for shareholders given the growth characteristics of the data center space, the specific markets we’ve entered, additional development capacity and the uniqueness of Iron Mountain’s brand and customer portfolio. Including these three transactions in our organic base, including Northern Virginia and the underground data centers in Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, our existing data center operations span 90-plus megawatts with expansion capacity of an additional 160 megawatts, bringing our total potential platform to more than 250 megawatts. Stuart will have more detail on the financial impact of our 2018 guidance and 2020 plan from the accelerated growth in our data center business in a few minutes. On Slide 7, I want to reiterate that following the issuance of debt and equity to finance the IO transaction, we remain on track with our deleveraging and payout ratio targets for 2020, which assumes a 4% annual increase in dividends per share, as shown in this depiction of our financial model.  Stuart will address our balance sheet shortly, but I’d like to briefly note that whilst we’re disappointed with the market selloff of REITs in anticipation of increasing interest rates, it is important to recognize that those rate hikes are generally associated with inflationary pressure. Unlike many REITs, we have the ability to pass through inflation-based rental rate increases on an annual basis, and we see meaningful flow-through on those increases given the high-margin characteristics of our storage business.  In a nutshell, given our 75% storage gross margin, coupled with the ability to increase pricing in line with inflation, higher inflationary environments generally expand our margins and accelerate our cash generation well ahead of inflation. In a word, inflation helps us further helps us further outperform as a business, which is pretty unique in the world of income-oriented stocks. To wrap up, we had a very eventful year with solid fundamental results from storage revenue underpinning our progress in driving improved profitability, whilst at the same time laying the foundation for sustained and accelerated growth through expansion of our faster-growing portfolio of data centers, Emerging Markets and Adjacent Businesses.  Our progress drives growth and adjusted EBITDA and cash flow that ultimately supports our ability to continue to grow dividends per share and delever over time. In fact, Iron Mountain is unique amongst top-yielding S&P 500 companies and that we continue to demonstrate strong internal revenue growth with attractive long-term growth potential.  We are encouraged by the tremendous progress made in 2017 and our momentum moving into 2018, and we will continue to be disciplined about deploying capital to accelerate growth in a manner that is consistent with our financial framework.  With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Stuart. 
Stuart Brown: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. We’re excited to deliver another strong quarter and year of robust storage rental growth and enhanced margins, reflecting the strength of our global position and the discipline of our management teams. We remain steadily on track to deliver on our financial and strategic goals, anchored with a disciplined investment strategy oriented toward faster-growing, value-creating businesses.  On today’s call, I will review our 2017 full year performance compared to expectations and cover the fourth quarter’s operational and financial drivers. Then I will lay out our expectations for 2018 with an update on our 2020 plan, considering also the recent data center acquisitions.  Turning to our full year performance on Slide 8 of the presentation. Results were generally in line with our guidance discussed on last quarter’s call. Revenue came in at $3.8 billion and just above the range as a result of strong internal storage revenue growth, driven by our revenue management efforts as well as currency translation benefits.  Adjusted EBITDA of $1.26 billion was in the middle of our range. Compared to the full year 2016, our adjusted EBITDA margin improved 180 basis to 32.8%, with higher gross margins and lower SG&A as a percentage of revenues. Our structural tax rate for the year was slightly lower than we had guided on the Q3 call due to the mix in North America taxable income between the Q1 and taxable entities. AFFO came in at the higher end of our range due to efficiencies in capital maintenance projects following the acquisition of Recall, as discussed last quarter.  Let’s now turn to our results for the fourth quarter. As you can see on Slide 9, it shows our key financial metrics, our fourth quarter total revenues grew 6.1% over last year or 4.1% on a constant-dollar basis. Internal storage rental revenue increased a strong 4.2% in the quarter, while internal service revenue declined 0.1% as we cycled against a large entertainment services project a year ago.  Our gross profit margin improved by 130 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by synergies from the Recall acquisition reducing labor expenses and the flow-through of our revenue management program. Compared to a year ago, our adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter increased over 10% to almost $327 million, leveraging growth of approximately 8% on a constant-dollar basis.  And EBITDA margin increased 120 basis points to 32.9% as we leverage labor and facility costs. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.29 per share, inclusive of a $0.02 per share increase in amortization expense, reflecting a catch-up associated with an adjustment to the life of Recall’s customer relationship value. Adjusted EPS would have been $0.31 per share excluding this catch-up.  AFFO was $154 million in the fourth quarter, in line with the expectations discussed in our last call, but down year-over-year due to timing of capital expenditures and cash expenses. Maintenance and non-real estate investments increased $28 million compared to a year ago as the costs were more back-end weighted this year, as we have previously indicated. On cash taxes, there was a swing of $14 million compared to a year ago. Turning to Slide 10 in internal growth performance for the quarter. We are very pleased with the momentum in internal storage growth, which resulted from strong revenue management efforts as records volume held flat in developed markets and continued growing in emerging markets where we're shifting more of our mix. Almost half of our total revenue comes from the developed markets storage business, which had 3.4% internal growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, records volume growth was modestly positive on the base of over 500 million cubic feet in storage. Internal service revenue in developed markets increased 0.1% due to continued growth in our shred business and other project-based revenue, slightly offset by lower average prices for recycled paper. In Other International, we continue to see storage internal revenue growth of 6.8%. Service internal revenue growth in the segment was flat as we continue to cycle over a high level of Recall destruction projects a year ago. In other reporting segments, the details of which are in the supplemental, the legacy data center business saw strong internal revenue growth slightly north of 20%, which excludes our recent acquisitions. Internal service revenue growth in Corporate and Other was down year-over-year due to the lapping of the project in entertainment services business. Turning to Slide 11. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter expanded in North America records management and Western Europe compared to a year ago as we continue to benefit from the flow-through of our revenue management programs and realize the benefits from Recall synergies and our transformation initiative. In North America Data Management, adjusted EBITDA margins were down slightly year-over-year as we continue to invest in more new product development than a year ago. As a reminder, this segment has been restated and no longer includes our entertainment services business, which is more skewed towards a service than storage. In the Global Data Center segment, adjusted EBITDA margins improved as we continue to scale the business. Over the long-term, we closer to a mid to high 50% range as we integrate the IO acquisition and continue to scale. Before I cover guidance for 2018, let me briefly turn to our balance sheet. We continued our successful refinancing efforts in the fourth quarter with a GBP400 bond offering resulting in our having over 80% of our debt at fixed rates and a reduction in our weighted average interest rate to 5% at year-end. In addition, these efforts extended our average maturity to 6.8 years with a well-laddered maturity schedule. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our lease-adjusted leverage ratio was 5x, helped by the December capital raising associated with the IO Data Center acquisition, which closed in January of this year. We expect our leverage ratio to be closer to the mid-5x EBITDAR for the first quarter and remain there for most of the year, and then decline as we begin recognizing growing cash flows from data centers, acquisition synergies and lease-up. We remain on track with our plan to reduce our lease-adjusted leverage to about 5x by 2020, as I will discuss in a moment. Let's turn to expectations underpinning our guidance for 2018 summarized on Page 12 of the results presentation. Please note that our guidance is on a constant-dollar basis and based on January 2018 exchange rates. In addition, it reflects the impact of the new revenue recognition standard we adopted effective January 1, 2018. This guidance is very much in line with long-term expectations and reflects our growing data center platform. At the midpoint and on a constant-currency basis, we expect total revenues to grow by 8%, adjusted EBITDA by 14% and AFFO to grow by 9% in 2018 compared with 2017. 2018 total revenue growth will be driven by internal storage revenue growth, which is expected to be between 3% and 3.5%, reflecting ongoing revenue management efforts in developed markets and volume growth in emerging markets. For the first quarter, remember that North America will be lapping a prior year period that had a significant amount of new customer activity. As a result, developed markets' trailing 12-month internal volume growth reporting in Q1 2018 is expected to decline up to 50 basis points and then improve as we move through the year. For the full year, we expect to see positive internal volume growth in Western Europe, while we anticipate lower income and volume from existing customers in North America, leading to a slight volume decline overall in developed markets. As a result, net internal volume growth in developed markets is expected to be flat to down 25 basis points in 2018 on a base of over 500 million cubic feet. However, as mentioned, revenue management and emerging markets revenue growth are projected to deliver total storage rental revenue growth of 3% to 3.5%. Our internal revenue guidance does not include the data center business recently acquired as these would be in operation for less than a year and wouldn't be a part of our internal growth calculations for 2018. The data center revenue is expected to be approximately $200 million with leasing approaching 10 megawatts, but not all will take occupancy in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA growth is expected to accelerate with the expansion of our data center business as well as margin expansion from the continued realization of savings related to the Recall acquisition, our continuous improvement initiatives and ongoing revenue management initiatives. In addition, our adjusted EBITDA will benefit from the new revenue recognition standard by about $25 million to $30 million due to the capitalization of commissions and initial intake costs. Excluding the impact of the revenue recognition standard, adjusted EBITDA growth would be approximately 12% at the midpoint, and adjusted EBITDA margin will increase 120 basis points from 2017. Our structural tax rate is expected to be between 18% to 20% in 2018, reflecting lower rates in the U.S. taxable lease subsidiary, offsetting continued growth in our international businesses. Interest expense is expected to be between $415 million to $425 million, while our average share count is expected to be around 287 million shares in 2018, reflecting the financing of the IO Data Center acquisition. Adjusted EPS for 2018 reflects the increased depreciation and amortization and interest expense from recent data center acquisitions. There is no material benefit to adjusted EPS from the new revenue recognition standard as the cost capitalization will be largely offset by amortization related to these expenses. AFFO growth reflects the strength and durability of our storage business. We expect growth of 9% to the midpoint of guidance, with maintenance capital expenditures and non-real estate investments of approximately $155 million to $165 million next year, together representing roughly 4% of revenue consistent with 2017. Also, we don't add back the amortization related to commissions to calculate AFFO, so the new revenue recognition standard has no material impact. Let me turn to our capital investment expectations. As always, we remain focused on expanding shareholder value through prudent capital deployment where we can achieve returns in excess of our hurdle rate. For 2018, we continue to expect to spend $150 million on core M&A transactions as well as $100 million to acquire the two Credit Suisse data centers. The bulk of the core activity is expected to be in higher-growth emerging markets, consistent with our 2020 plan. In addition, we expect to invest $185 million on data center development, including data halls in Northern Virginia and expansion in Phoenix, which will come online and generate storage revenue beyond 2018 with stabilized double-digit NOI yields. We expect to fund these growth investments through a combination of cash from operations, debt, capital recycling from the sale of real estate as well as potential ATM issuances, particularly to fund the Credit Suisse data center acquisition. Lastly, our cash available for distribution, or CAD, continues to fund our dividend as well as maintenance and core growth investments, as you can see on Slide 13 of the presentation. With our recent expansion in the data center business, we have updated our 2020 plan that we've previously laid out on Investor Day. As you can see on Slide 14, on a compounded annual growth rate basis, we anticipate revenue to grow by almost 7% from 2017 to 2020; adjusted EBITDA to grow by 11%; and AFFO to grow over 11% or over 7% on a per share basis. With expectations of a dividend per share growth around 4%, as Bill discussed, we expect an AFFO payout ratio in the mid-70s and our leverage ratio to be around 5x in 2020. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in 2017, which continues to be underscored by the strength and durability of our storage rental business. Our core business fuels the cash flow growth, thereby funding investment to continue growth and enhance returns to shareholders. We're excited to accelerate our growth as we expand in the data center space and confident in the value we'll create for shareholders over time by the platform we've built. We remain well-positioned to deliver on our near and long-term financial projections. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we open it up for Q&A.
Bill Meaney: Thank you, Stuart. Just a few points. We continue to drive improved internal storage revenue growth across both developed and emerging markets. The recent expansion of our data center business through the acquisition of IO and Fortrust and the expected acquisition of Credit Suisse data centers will take our organic EBITDA growth from 3.5% in Q4 to over 5% in 2020. We have done all this whilst remaining committed to our financial framework and targets. Net of all this, we continue to be a standout in the S&P with a strong dividend plus robust and sustainable growth. With that, I would like to hand it over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore.
Sheila McGrath: I was just – first, I had a question on guidance, if you could give us a little bit more color. Now owning more data centers, will this mean higher CapEx and straight-lining adjustments to get to AFFO?
Stuart Brown: Yes, it will mean – well, most of the CapEx that we'll be having initially will really be building out the development pipeline, right? We're really going from a pretty small development pipeline, but the growth opportunities that we have in Denver, in Arizona, in New Jersey as well as the Virginia campus, we'll continue to build the development pipeline. With that comes, from a GAAP standpoint, obviously, capitalized expenses and capitalized interest. And then as the leases grow, we will be straight-lining rent adjustment coming into AFFO.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. And a follow-up. Could you give us an update on how leasing is going at some of the data center projects and some insight on the IO transaction and integration?
Bill Meaney: Yes, it's a good question. We're really pleased by – I guess, we expected an acceleration in terms of the pipeline, in terms of new sales, but I think getting the new logos, so to speak, from IO, which are also existing customers for Iron Mountain both, some on the data center side, but a number of them in our data management or our records side, has really accelerated the conversation both for us, but also for the IO sales force. So we're really encouraged. It's obviously early days, but the feedback that I've been getting from the sales teams is they've already seen an increase in activity, an increase in interest in what we're offering.
Stuart Brown: In Northern Virginia, the first data hall we built out is about two-thirds leased already, and that's why we've got in our plans to go and build up the next two data halls. We've seen a lot of interest, the potential pipeline as a multiple of what we've got in our expectations for next year for lease-up. So we're pretty confident in the 10 megawatts that we've got in the guidance for next year.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, great. I’ll get back in the queue.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hey, good morning. Just two, just on the volume decline in 2018, it sounds like there's some kind of mathematical calculation risk over there. Can you just explain why particularly the volumes to decline?
Bill Meaney: Hi, Shlomo, good morning. Yes. By the way, your – I got the question, but your phone is breaking up. But anyway, there's a couple of things going on. One of the things, as Stuart pointed out, is that we're lapping a strong comparable in Q1 of last year because of some new customer activity. But overall, it's the same trend that we called out last time is that if you look at incoming volume from existing customers in North America versus Western Europe, Western Europe, we're still seeing kind of, what I'd say, steady incoming percentage growth from existing customers, where we've seen a reduction in North America. Now some of that may be because we're being a bit more aggressive in terms of revenue management which, obviously, we rolled out a couple of years before we start rolling it out in Western Europe. That being said, we don't see an increase in destruction rate, and we don't – and we actually see a slight uptick in terms of new customers as we kind of focus on unvended, mid-market and federal government. So we expect that trend to continue. I mean, there is a little bit of an overlap of a high comparable in Q1. But as Stuart said, we think, overall, our developed markets will be flat to minus 0.25 basis point. And we expect those – that kind of trend to continue, and it's mainly driven by a slowdown of incoming volume from – still growing, but a slowdown of incoming volume from existing customers in North America. And I think, going forward, we will continue to optimize price for existing customers and continue to seek new volume more and more from unvended opportunities.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Just to understand this better, if I were to look in 2019 – to be roughly flat or I guess [indiscernible] volumes start to decline?
Bill Meaney: No. Well, I think it will be roughly – if you look at developed markets, it will be roughly flat. I mean, I think you're still going to be, from a volume – don't forget, this is on 500 million cube, and so I think volume, if you look at developed markets, are probably continuing to hover in kind of the flat, plus or minus, let's say, 0.25 basis point, so maybe negative, maybe flat, maybe slightly up. But we continue to feel that we're not going for share in these markets. And so we think the right thing to do is to make sure that we're using revenue management appropriately, so we're not trying to increase the amount of growth from existing customers.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And just, Stuart, can you walk us through some of the assumptions beyond 2018 to get us to 2020, how are you going to delever to 5x and get AFFO coverage down to 70% to 75% if you're going to be continuing to invest in data center and build out these data center assets? Is there some kind of big step-up in margin that we should be expecting that are going to improve the leverage ratio? Just can you give us some of the pieces of the puzzle that we need to build a model that will help us understand this?
Stuart Brown: Shlomo, let me start with the – I mean, the target of – for leverage and – for our leverage framework is really built around two things: a, optimizing our cost of capital; and b, making sure that we've got capacity in our balance sheet to be able to take advantage of opportunities. There's no liquidity issue where we're sitting today from a leverage standpoint. So as we want to delever over time, it's more about getting back to creating that capacity for us to take advantage of dislocations. So with that said, we said when we purchased IO that we will be taking a step-up in leverage related to that and that will delever naturally over time with organic growth. However, we will be putting capital back to work in development as well. And so the funding of that additional development as we kind of build our data center pipeline like other data center REITs, how are we going to fund that? We will get some cash flow from operations. We will use the ATM for things like Credit Suisse, and we're looking at capital recycling opportunities. And we've been – just to give you an example of one we've got right now is we've recently purchased a property in the Midlands outside of London. And we're going to sell some fairly high-value properties that are in – much closer into the city, I think it's three properties, as we move out to the Midlands over the next couple of years. So those are the types of opportunities where we can sell those types of properties through a short-term leaseback and then move back and move out to cheaper properties as records management becomes more archival so that we've got a number of levers that we can pull to fund the data center expansion. And if you look at the model that we provided on 2020, coming back to your payout ratio question, right, we're not going to – we don't anticipate the dividend to grow as fast as AFFO. And so again, you get a natural reduction of the payout ratio down into the mid-70s.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, and I'll work with that. And then can you give me – give us, on the acquisition – excuse me, when you're saying the data center is expected to provide $200 million of revenue, $100 million of normalized EBITDA in 2018, what are you normalizing for?
Stuart Brown: So the only thing that's normalized for in that number is the integration costs related to IO, and that's $4 million to $5 million. That $4 million to $5 million is built into our total EBITDA guidance, but we normalize for that when you look straight at just the data center number.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPM.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, it’s Andrew. When looking at the current status of the 2020 plan on Slide 14, one of the underlying assumptions there is to achieve the $2.54 dividend per share goal is a higher margin assumption. The implied margin for 2020 is now 36.8%. Previously, it was 35.6%. What gives your team confidence in higher 2020 margins than previously thought?
Bill Meaney: So let me kind of give you the high-level view of it, Andrew, and then I'll let Stuart comment more. But the part that's really given us the confidence is the traction that we've gotten on the revenue management side of the storage business. You can see that in terms of the margin expansion that we've gotten in the last 12 months because what we're doing right now is we still think we'll be able to maintain 3% to 3.5% internal revenue growth on the storage side, and we're doing that at the same time whilst minimizing the amount of racking and boxes that we have to put in place to take the boxes because we're relying more and more on price. So we feel really good about – and we already see that. We've seen an acceleration in our margin increase. But I mean, Stuart, you may want to comment more in terms of our specific margin target.
Stuart Brown: Just two other quick things I'll point out, right, we're coming in, in a little bit of a higher base, right? We've outperformed expectations in 2017. The other thing, Andrew, don't forget, is the revenue recognition accounting change has an impact on that margin as well, so you need to normalize for that.
Andrew Steinerman: Right. So just to say, cleanly, the success of 2017, revenue recognition, but it's not like you're saying I'm going to have higher synergies than previously thought on Recall or higher transformational initiatives.
Bill Meaney: No, no. It's really driven by the gross margin on the business.
Andrew Steinerman: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.
Karin Ford: Hi, good morning. Just a couple more questions on guidance. What are the expectations on the service side for revenue growth and margins in 2018?
Stuart Brown: Revenue growth on the service side is expected to be flat. It will be a little bit better than we've had in the past really because of the shred business. We see stronger growth on the shred side.
Karin Ford: Okay. And do you expect steady margins based on that?
Bill Meaney: Well, I think, actually, if you look at it, Karin, if you look at historically over the last three years, we're really pleased in the progress that we've made both on the storage margin but also as well as just in terms of storage growth. You can start seeing through – you see that we have positive internal storage rate of growth both for developed markets and emerging markets. And that's really how – as we've been replacing with historically with the bedrock, which was the transportation, with some of the new service offerings, so we feel really good with the progress and the momentum that we're building there.
Karin Ford: Great. Next question is, you mentioned you're going to be rolling out revenue management into the emerging markets in 2018. How much do you think that could boost organic revenue growth in the emerging markets?
Bill Meaney: We're not – we're going to stay within our overall guidance that Stuart laid out, the 3% and 3.5% overall. I mean, we'll give you more flavor as we go forward. You could see a little bit of the impact this past quarter, but we're still focused in those markets. Think about those markets, a lot of them were still focused on getting to a market-leading position. And when you're in a market-leading position, obviously, volume is your primary lever that you're looking at. And then at some point, you start harvesting that volume and optimize it with revenue management. So we are introducing because we think there are some – there is some low-hanging fruit in some of those markets. But I think our first quarter call, sort of speaking, that we are applying some of the tools now in emerging markets is Western Europe because we think there's a lot more that can be done if you just look at that Western Europe, we're still relying on volume growth more than revenue growth in terms of – I mean, volume growth more than revenue management to get to the revenue growth in that market. And we think we can optimize that further as we look at being efficient capital allocators.
Karin Ford: Okay, thanks. I know I've asked you this question on calls past. But now that the tax law is settled, did you guys review whether or not you want to maintain your REIT status? And did you consider de-REIT-ing?
Bill Meaney: I'll start, and then Stuart could give you the technical answer. Yes, I mean, of course, we look at these things, but it's not even close, right? I mean, if you think about us as an income-oriented stock, we're kind of unique. We have a high yield and we have strong growth going forward. And we're attractive to income-oriented investors, whether they are REITs or C-Corp type investors. And given the nature of our business where we generate a lot of cash, the REIT framework is still an efficient way for us to give benefits to our shareholders, and we drive our – most of our revenue from real estate in terms of the storage nature of the business. And the fact that tax rates have come down, it just means they're paying less tax on the service side of the business. So – but I mean, Stuart, you may want to comment.
Stuart Brown: The other thing I'll add is on the data center side, I mean, the main reason we're expanding the data centers relationship we have with our customers and our ability to create value, the ability to leverage the REIT status on that is clearly helpful as well, right? So if you're Credit Suisse of the world, you're not getting the tax shield that we can provide as a REIT on those things. So a lot of data centers that are on the balance sheet of C-Corps are actually better in place than a balance sheet of a REIT. So we'll continue to leverage that as well.
Karin Ford: Great. Last one from me. In past cycles, have you seen demand increase when GDP growth goes above 3%? And what type of economic forecast have you baked in the guidance?
Bill Meaney: Yes. We haven’t – if we look at the guidance, right, what we've baked in is a little bit of inflation because probably, in the near term, I think the biggest benefit for us is – it's kind of like a rain dance, I pray for inflation every day I come to work because inflation, our top line is really driven by inflation. And GDP, for sure, I think if you've been following the company a long time, my predecessor had shown a number of graphs where GDP does drive volume growth. But I think given the amount of growth that we expect in – the change in growth of GDP over the next 8, 12 or 24 months, I think that's going to be less of a driver than the change of inflation. And of course, with a 75% gross margin storage business, every point of inflation expands our margins. So you were kind of unique in that sense. So I know that a lot of income-oriented companies don't like inflation because it's hard to keep dividend growth at pace with inflation. In our case, it's just the opposite. It allows – the more inflation allows us even to outperform with our dividend. So it's – so I think in the near term, I'm doing my inflation dance.
Karin Ford: Great. Thanks for taking the question.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Sheila McGrath with Evercore.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. Any update, insight how we should think about Recall and transformation impact in 2018?
Bill Meaney: It's mostly – I mean, Stuart, you may want to give more, but it's mostly done at this point. I mean, there's still a little bit – we always said that we think there's more to get done on some of the integration in terms of integrating facilities in real estate, and we're still picking through that. But I would say the bulk of it, I mean, Stuart.
Stuart Brown: Yes, the bulk of it is done in terms of the Recall investments. We do still have some back-office systems and some IT Recall costs as well, as well as the real estate that Bill mentioned. And the synergies will continue to sort of flow through as we ramp up. It's built into the guidance numbers, and we're right on track.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. And then just on G&A, that was a little higher than we had forecast in fourth quarter. I wonder if you can provide any detail on that and how we should think about this line item going forward.
Bill Meaney: If you look at – what I would look at, Sheila, because there's puts and takes, there is a seasonality aspect in terms of certain things that happened at the end of the year. If you look at year-on-year, you're right, Q3 to Q4 were flat. But if you look at year-on-year, we saw a nice improvement. There was some noise in the end of the quarter that we had some VAT issues that we're still working through, for instance, in India. But I think if you look at year-on-year, we continue to see that we'll continue to slowly tick down. I mean, in fairness, we've got most of the SG&A improvement, and we baked a little bit into our guidance for 2018. But a lot of what you see between the flattening out between Q3 and Q4 is in the year. But year-on-year, we're pretty happy.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, that's helpful. And then I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Iron Mountain sales force and cross-selling all of Iron Mountain. Are you restructuring incentives or anything to encourage the sales force to sell the new and expanded data center segment? Or is this segment going to rely mostly on the data center specific sales force?
Bill Meaney: No, it's a great question. That's one of the things that really excites us about the data center space. I think as we might have mentioned back in December that 65% of our sales – of our customers right now in our data centers are Iron Mountain ones. And then with IO, there's about a 45% overlap. And even in the short time that we've owned it is we see that the inquiries coming through our data management especially and, to a certain degree, our records management folks has been increasing. So – and how we coordinate that, there's always been a pretty good coordination, but we coordinate it with both art and science. So the art is fixed. So I'll give you an example. The Credit Suisse data centers came through our records management sales force in Europe that have been the relationship manager with Credit Suisse for a number of years, not even the data management folks just because of the strong relationship we have with Credit Suisse. And that we use both spiffs, and we also have some of those people actually carry a quota with a – which is the science part of it. But that's one of the reasons why we're really excited. And as I say, 950 of the Fortune 1000 are our customers, and over 35,000 data centers just in North America alone are people in and out of almost on a weekly basis. So it is starting to show real benefits.
Stuart Brown: Just to add one quick point onto that as well, just to give you a little bit of color. I mean, our data center team, even district commercials and our the data center team met the first day that IO closed at IO's facility, right, we got the entire commercial team together. And one of the reasons they're excited to be a part of Iron Mountain is now they've got a much bigger platform to be able to sell. And companies have been owned by private equity, right, or don't have the sort of the balance sheet to be able to provide the capacity for these sales teams to be able to provide the customers. So they've got a great roster of customers and a lot of potential transactions in the pipeline. And I guess I should probably welcome them all to the Iron Mountain team.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank.
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thank you. Hey. Really nice job on the internal storage growth, the 4.2% in Q4. That kind of took the full year up to 3.9% versus a range of 3% to 3.5%. Was there anything in there in terms of one-time like a termination fee or anything like that? Or was that just kind of the pure price kind of versus making the volume growth algorithm?
Stuart Brown: The only unusual item that was in there for the year was that – which we have it in the second quarter, and we fully talked about the SimpliVity on an annual basis, we had the SimpliVity termination fee back in the data center. And so that impacted the storage rental growth about 20 basis points for the quarter. But other than that, it's just strong underlying performance, 20 basis points for the year.
Kevin McVeigh: Great.
Stuart Brown: Yes.
Kevin McVeigh: For the full year. So the 3.9%, Stuart, would have been 3.7%, right, x that?
Stuart Brown: Correct.
Kevin McVeigh: Is that the way to think about it?
Stuart Brown: Yes.
Kevin McVeigh: Super. And just as you folks think about kind of price in kind of the revenue management versus the volume in the emerging markets in 2018, to get to that 3% to 3.5% range, is there any way to bracket how much is kind of revenue management versus emerging market unit volume growth, just to try to get a tighter range on what would be 3% versus 3.5%?
Stuart Brown: No, I mean, we gave you the guidance at the top level. If you look at the momentum that we built in the business between revenue management and volume growth in terms of how that's driving the 3% and 3.5%, it's pretty clear. And if you look at the emerging markets, you can see a slight upward trending, but I would instead continue on those trend lines. Effectively, what we're calling out is a similar – we expect a similar momentum or continued momentum and similar trend in the businesses.
Kevin McVeigh: Got it. And then just last one from me, if I could. The rev rec, the $7 million of revenue and the $25 million to $30 million in EBITDA, does that sit in storage or service? And would that be considered part of that internal growth, the $7 million of revenue? Or is that not impacted at all?
Stuart Brown: It was mostly – really mostly in service because it's the commission side, right, that's getting capitalized on EBITDA.
Kevin McVeigh: Got it. And Stuart, that impacts the internal growth in terms of the revenue or no?
Stuart Brown: No, no, we will exclude definitely internal growth.
Kevin McVeigh: Okay, awesome. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And next question is a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you for squeezing me back in. Stuart, can you give us just a little bit more detail on what your expectations were for data center in 2018 organically versus how much of the data center $200 million revenue, $100 million EBITDA, is acquisition? I know the vast majority of it is, but can you give us a little more specificity?
Stuart Brown: Yes. On the revenue side, I think the ongoing legacy business was about – I kind of remember off the top of my head, but – about $30 million – from the legacy business, about $30 million, and then you had the Fortrust acquisition and then IO on top of it from a revenue standpoint. And then from the IO transaction, we talked about it, with the equity offering, that, that will be, from an EBITDA perspective, around $80 million after integration.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: So when I think about it, should I be expecting, including the other acquisitions like Credit Suisse and everything, more like $90 million from EBITDA from acquisitions?
Stuart Brown: I mean, the numbers that we've provided include Credit Suisse, right. So the guidance numbers include Credit Suisse assuming that closes here later in the first quarter.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Right. Okay. I was just trying to get a kind of an organic growth of what you guys are seeing, expecting versus the acquisition growth.
Bill Meaney: I think if you can think about it, Shlomo, this way, is that we expect this year – because some of the acquisitions we have, we have to build out some capacity, so I think the organic growth will be a little bit slower than what we've seen in the previous years. So I'd say mid-teens in terms of organic revenue growth, and EBITDA will grow a little bit faster than that as some of the assets stabilize because we're, obviously, moving up in terms of our EBITDA margin. But I think it's kind of – I would expect kind of mid-teens in terms of revenue growth and a little bit better on EBITDA.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And as that was the last question, I would like to return the call to management for any closing comments.
Bill Meaney: We'd just like to thank everybody for listening in, and we look forward to a continued strength in 2018. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session and today's conference call.

Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Iron Mountain Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Melissa Marsden: Thank you, Austin. Good day and welcome everyone to our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. We appreciate that the timing of today's call is a bit unusual for our U.S. audience as we are conducting it today from Sydney, Australia and will be meeting with some new and legacy Recall investors later today and tomorrow. The user-controlled slides that we will be referring to in today's prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations site along with the link to today's webcast. You can find the presentation at ironmountain.com under About Us/Investors/Events & Presentations. Alternatively, you can access today's financial highlights, press release, the presentation and the full supplemental financial information together in one PDF file by going to investors.ironmountain.com, under Financial Information. Additionally, we have filed all the related documents as one 8-K, which is also available on the Web site. On today's call, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic plan; followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Referring now to Page 2 of the presentation, today's earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2017 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings call presentation, supplemental financial report, the safe harbor language on this slide, and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in this supplemental financial information package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Meaney: Thank you, Melissa, and hello, everyone. We are pleased to report strong third quarter financial and operating results and solid progress against our 2020 plan. We achieved financial performance in line with our expectations and drove robust internal revenue growth and enhanced profitability across the business. Our results reflect the durability of our high margin storage business and improved contribution from Recall synergies and our transformation initiative, both of which have enhanced profitability and cash flow growth. As a result, today we also announced a 6.8% increase in our quarterly dividend per share, well in excess of inflation. Even after this growth in the dividend, we expect the payout ratio to be a little below our prior guidance with the previous lower dividend per share rate. During the quarter we made meaningful progress on the execution of our strategic plan across all facets of the business. As you know, our plan is focused on extending our durable business model through continued investment in our core developed markets, expanding into faster growing emerging markets and adjacent storage related businesses such as data center and art storage, and capturing opportunities to provide new innovative solutions to both our new and existing customers. We also achieved internal storage rental revenue growth of 3.5%, which reflects our revenue management focus and 1.3% growth in internal records management volume or prior to the effects of acquisitions and dispositions. As noted last quarter, trailing 12 month volume growth now includes Recall volume in the base which increased by about 20%, making percentage growth figures a bit lower even though the growth in underlying cubic feet of records remains consistent. In fact, new volume from new and existing customers of 49 million cubic feet over the past 12 months is consistent with last quarter's reported figure and compares favorably with pre-Recall levels of about 43 million cubic feet on a trailing 12 months basis, which you can see in the chart in the appendix. These favorable trends demonstrate the consistency of customer service behaviors, and importantly, these new records stay with us for an average of 15 years. Slide 4 is a review of the highlights related to our strategic plan. In developed markets, which include both our North American RIM and Western European segment, we achieved weighted average internal storage revenue growth of 3.2% with 1 million cubic feet of net internal volume growth on a trailing-12 month basis. We are pleased with the durability of volume growth and our ability to achieve price gains in developed markets. In addition, I am pleased to report solid progress from our dedicated focus on the U.S. federal market opportunity. We recently secured an additional multiyear contract from the United States Patent and Trademark Office or PTO. We will be responsible for relocating more than 4.5 million patent files, which includes capturing file level metadata, packing, removal, and transportation of all records to our secure federal government compliant storage facility. This contract reflects our unique ability to address the government's needs for improving the security and accessibility of government owned records with superior chain of custody and highly responsive service, while helping to reduce its operational expenses and real estate footprint. With this award, we now protect all significant repositories of PTO's intellectual property, including their data center and continuity of operations records, their patent and trademark files in micrographic format, and their hard copy patent files. Looking at our goal of expanding our business into faster growing emerging markets, we are at about 18% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis, almost double the relative size from about 10% just three years ago. Progress against this goal was supported by emerging market acquisitions closed during the quarter, including the acquisition in Cyprus noted on last quarter's call and a small deal in South Africa totaling about $25 million. In adjacent businesses, we have laid the foundation for significant expansion of our data center and entertainment services businesses, both of which have growth rates in excess of those of the traditional records management, data management businesses. Turning to Slide 5. During the quarter we opened the first phase of our Northern Virginia data center campus in late September with the first third of that building being fully developed and more than 50% pre-leased. When adding existing capacity from our Boston, Boyers, Pennsylvania, and Kansas City locations to current and planned expansion capacity associated with recent acquisitions and Northern Virginia development, we have the potential to provide roughly 110 megawatts of multi-tenant and hyper scale data center capacity. We have included a capacity Slide in the appendix of this presentation for your reference. We see the data center business as an area where one plus one equals three. In other words, we see our unique combination of additional data center capacity plus our deep data management customer base has an opportunity to add significant value and achieve higher fill rates. In September, we closed on the acquisition of FORTRUST, which we discussed on our last conference call. We also entered into a sale leaseback agreement for two Credit Suisse data centers in London and Singapore, among the fastest growing global markets in terms of data center absorption. We expect to close this transaction in Q1 2018. After closing, we will have the ability to leverage the existing infrastructure and in 12 to 18 months time, develop up to 10 megawatts of new data center capacity in both buildings for lease to other customers. The sale leaseback structure is attractive to both us and corporate data center operators who increasingly are utilizing such strategies to refine their IT infrastructure. Most enterprise data center facilities are over-engineered and overbuilt. We can help these companies monetize their assets as they look to focus on core capabilities whilst regenerate rental income from captive, high credit quality tenants, and develop the remaining capacity to support new customer requirements. Synergies will come over time as we build out the additional data center capacity and gain economies of scale from the existing operations. Operational costs are in place to scale up the business in these locations. We expect a double digit stabilized yield from this transaction following build out and lease up of the expansion capacity. As noted earlier, this transaction is not part of our 2020 growth plan. That plan, which didn’t assume data center acquisitions also did not assume the issuance of equity. You may have noted that at the time we announced the Credit Suisse deal, we also filed a registration statement for an ATM or at the market equity issuance plan. We think ATM issuances are prudent way to match and to fund smaller transactions that are not included in our core M&A plan. Our ATM plan can support up to 500 million of equity issuance over time, but we have earmarked just $100 million, about 2.5 million shares or less than 1% of total outstanding for the Credit Suisse deal. Also in adjacent businesses, we acquired Bonded Services, a leading provider of media asset management services for global entertainment and media companies for approximately 57 million pounds or $77 million. This acquisition is included in our year-to-date total of approximately $195 million, of which $55 million with the cash portion of the FORTRUST consideration. Entertainment and media companies require specialized services for protecting and preserving intellectual property whilst also making sure then can monetize it. Such as the project for MTV's 30th anniversary that we supported last year and similar relationships with major studios, recording artists and sports franchisees. Providing these customers with both physical and digital storage as well as capabilities transform content from monetization and longer term preservation in one place is ideal. Bonded also provides fine art vaults and shipping, logistics and distribution and related services through locations in the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, France, The Netherlands and Hong Kong. And it doubles our existing entertainment services businesses and solidifies our position as the partner of choice. Turning to Slide six. We also made good progress on our innovation agenda in moving certain projects out of the garage. We launched Iron Cloud and expanded our Policy Center offering which we previewed at April's investor day. Iron Cloud's on demand storage can be accessed through a secure connection from customers to our network of secure data center and caters to the unique security and operational needs of medical imaging surveillance video and other specialty media. Our suite of data management solutions enables organizations to manage risk by complying with industry standards and implement advanced schemes to protect against cyber attacks. Just in a few short weeks since the launch, we have already secured a major win with an U.K. pharmaceutical company. To wrap up, we had a very eventful quarter with solid fundamental results underpinning our progress with new initiatives and the expansion of our faster growing emerging markets and adjacent businesses. We continue to leverage our deep customer relationships and leading brand attributes of trust and security to offer more technology enabled solutions as our customers continue to transform to a more digital way of working. These are early days but we are encouraged by the progress we are seeing and we will continue to be disciplined about how and where we deploy capital to accelerate growth outside the traditional businesses. Our progress supports growth and adjusted EBITDA and cash flow that ultimately underpins our ability to grow our dividend per share and to delever over time. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Stuart.
Stuart Brown: Thank you, Bill, and good day everyone. We are excited to report another strong quarter of continuing growth at our core storage rental business and good progress increasing our capital flexibility through our refinancing activity. We remain steadily on track to deliver on our financial objectives and strategic goals with a disciplined investment strategy. As Bill mentioned, it is based upon this continued demonstration of growth and business durability that our board of directors increased the fourth quarter dividend by 6.8% to approximately $0.59 per share, reflecting an annualized rate of $2.35 per share, up from $2.20 per share previously. On today's call I will provide some color on the third quarter's operational and financial drivers, touch on the implications of our refinancing activity and then cover our outlook for 2017. As we have noted previously, we will issue specific 2018 guidance in connection with our fourth quarter earnings call in February, consistent with most peers. As you see on Slide 7, which shows our key financial metrics, our third quarter total revenues grew 2.4% over last year or 1.4% on a C$ basis, impacted by the disposition of our legacy Australian business as well as our businesses in Russia and Ukraine. Internal storage rental revenue growth was a strong 3.5% in the quarter, while internal service revenue declined 20%. The growth in internal storage revenue resulted from our revenue management focus and continued growth in internal global net volume. That is growth prior to acquisitions and dispositions. Our gross profit margin improved 210 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by synergies from the Recall acquisition and the flow through of our revenue management program, partly offset by $3.5 million charge associated with the recent natural disasters. In particular, our service gross profit has improved by $10 million year-over-year to $102 million. In addition, SG&A as a percentage of total revenues decreased 20 basis points year-over-year excluding Recall costs due to the benefits of our transformation initiatives and synergies. Compared to a year ago, our adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter grew about 10% to $323 million. That’s growth of over 8% on a C$ basis and the adjusted EBITDA margin increased 230 basis points to 33.5%. AFFO was $210 million in the third quarter, an increase of $32 million or about 19% from last year. The strong growth resulted from the almost 10% increase or $29 million of growth in adjusted EBITDA and more than funds the 7% dividend increase we announced today. Touching on Slide 8 quickly. This shows the relative size of each product line and the contribution of our results split between storage and service and showing line of business. Over 80% of our adjusted gross profit is derived from storage activities with a 75% gross profit margin. We continue to innovate our new service and storage offerings for our customers focusing on value added services that deliver gross profit growth and we are pleased with the progress supporting our strategic objectives for developed and emerging markets. Turning to Slide 9 and internal growth performance. You see developed markets, which includes North America records and information management, North America data management and western Europe, as well as other international, which includes our emerging markets businesses as well as Australia. Almost half of our total revenues comes from the developed markets storage business which grew internal storage revenue by 3.2%, largely from our revenue management initiatives including programs to improve customer mix. In total, in developed markets we achieved internal volume growth of 0.2% for the third quarter on a trailing 12-month basis as illustrated on Slide 15 of the appendix. Turning to North America records and information management specifically. Whilst internal volume growth was negative 0.2%, we continue to see strong internal storage revenue growth of 3.5% in the quarter. Looking ahead, we anticipate North America internal storage revenue growth to be north of 2.5% with flat internal volume growth, plus or minus, as we work to optimize returns, balancing revenue management and capital efficiencies. Internal service revenue in developed markets was down 0.1% as growth in information governance, digital imaging projects, tread activity and other project based revenue was offset by lower activity in the data management and other businesses and slightly lower paper prices. In other international, we continue to see strong internal storage revenue growth of 5%. Service internal growth in this segment was flat as we cycle over a high level of Recall [construction] [ph] projects underway a year ago. And you can see in our supplemental reporting package, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded in all segments compared to the year ago except in North America data management where we continue to invest in new product development as Bill discussed. Adjusted EBITDA margins in this business segment though continue to be a healthy 53%. As a reminder our corporate and other segment includes overhead costs as well as adjacent businesses such as data center and fine art. Internal results are impacted by the small comparative base from a year ago as well as integration costs associated with recent acquisitions in this segment. Shifting now to our balance sheet. We opportunistically executed several meaningful debt transactions in the third quarter which together provide increased capital flexibility and term out our borrowings that you see on Slide 10. First, we amended our credit facility with improved covenants which increased flexibility and better recognized the value of our real estate holdings thereby reducing our lease adjusted leverage ratio. Second, we redeemed 200 million Canadian dollar senior notes due 2021, utilizing revolving credit capacity. Additionally, we redeemed $1 billion of senior notes due 2020 at a 6% rate and issued new senior notes at 4.875% due 2027. Lastly, we extended and increased our AR securitization program. In total, these actions extended our average maturity to 6.5 years reduced our average cost of debt by about 30 basis points, resulting in approximately $18 million in annualized interest expense savings. We incurred a charge for debt extinguishment cost of $48 million in the quarter. The attractive pricing reflects bondholders understanding the health of our business and durability of our cash flows. As of the end of the quarter, we had reduced our lease adjusted leverage ratio to 5.5 times from 5.8 times in Q2 and increased the capacity available on our capital structure remaining on track with our plan to reduce our lease adjusted leverage. Let's turn to our guidance for 2017 which is summarized on Page 11 of the results presentation. Our core guidance remains unchanged. So given where we are in the year, we are converting guidance to reported dollar or R$. Given the somewhat limited net impact of currency changes, we expect to remain within the same guidance ranges on a C$ and reported dollar basis. Given we have increased our outlook for storage internal revenue growth to be between 3% and 3.5% from 2.5% to 3%. As a result of this better growth in considering a modest benefit from exchange rate, 2017 total revenues are expected to be near the high end of the guidance range. On adjusted EBITDA, we are maintaining our guidance range despite the delayed timing of acquisitions though still incurring integration costs, the impact of the Russia Ukraine dispositions as well as charges related to natural disasters, which were partly offset by favorable exchange rates and onetime items we highlighted in the second quarter. As a reminder, our shared service implementation costs as well as innovation investments are weighted to the latter part of the year. As a result, we expect only limited adjusted EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter from the third quarter. Following on the strong margin improvement in 2017, we remain on track with our 2020 plan to deliver about 200 to 250 basis points of margin improvements from our underlying business as outlined at our investor day, implying an improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins of 50 to 75 basis points in 2018. In addition, our expectation for the 2017 structural tax rate is now 21% to 22%, driven by changes in our business mix. For 2017, the increase in taxes will only be somewhat offset by the partial year benefit of the interest expense savings. Touching on AFFO guidance. We expect to be closer to the upper end of the range of $760 million, as we expect total maintenance and non-real estate investment to be roughly $150 million for the year, benefitting from better efficiencies and discipline following the acquisition of Recall. In turn, we expect an improved dividend payout ratio relative to AFFO considering also the dividend increase we have just announced. The FORTRUST and Bonded acquisitions are not expected to have a significant financial impact this year given the partial year contribution and the integration cost associated with both transactions. Remember also that FORTRUST was partially funded by a private placement of shares to the seller, so our outlook reflects an increase of about 2 million shares outstanding, or roughly 1 million shares on a weighted average basis for 2017. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter, reflecting the hard work and discipline across the organization. We remain well positioned to deliver on our financial projections for 2017 and our performance continues to be underscored by the durability of our storage rental business which builds our cash flow growth thereby funding investment to continue growth and returns to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we open up to Q&A.
William Meaney: Thank you, Stuart and just to sum up. We had a very good quarter punctuated by another period with strong revenue growth and particularly strong storage revenue growth of 3.5% before acquisitions. We continue to be on track with our integration of Recall which shows through our continued growth in EBITDA margin. Based on this performance, we have pulled forward our anticipated 6.8% dividend per share increase by a quarter and even with this payout ratio of roughly 80% of AFFO, we will be below our original guidance for the year with the previously lower dividend. We continue to make good progress in our adjacent business areas with the closing of the FORTRUST data center business in this quarter and the announcement of our agreement to purchase some of Credit Suisse's data centers. And doing all this whilst improving our financial flexibility, extending debt maturity and reducing our interest cost. With that, I would like to turn the call over to the operator so we can begin Q&A. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath: Good morning in Australia. Another solid storage same store revenue growth of 3.5%. You did cite the yield management system. I am just wondering if there are any other factors driving that strong growth relative to your 2016 kind of growth levels.
William Meaney: No. I mean you can see if you look at the overall business, it's the result of the volume growth that we had. And so if you look across the whole business it’s positive volumes, and the revenue management together yield to 3.5%. But I think that the most -- the big difference as you say, the year ago, Sheila, is the revenue management program that we started putting in place two years ago. And it takes a while to ramp that through as contracts becomes renewed. And you can see the difference between, say, North America, from an internal revenue growth versus Europe. Where in Europe we are probably about a year behind, in developed markets as well, about a year behind from when we rolled it out in North America. So we think there is still more to be done specifically in Europe and developed markets as those results are flowing through from the work that we did starting a year ago in those geographies. But a big part of it is the revenue management systems.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. Great. And just one follow up. On the data center space, I know it's still small in your adjacent business, but you are allocating more capital there. I just was wondering if you could talk about pricing of the two acquisitions. How you look at it? Is it just on a stabilized basis or how you are underwriting it because I realize it's a competitive environment out there.
William Meaney: It's a good question, Sheila. You can probably appreciate having watched -- having you watched this phase for a while. We have passed on more than we actioned. In other words, it's an area where you have to be disciplined in terms of your capital allocation. So our first and foremost thing is to make sure that on a stabilized basis that we get the types of returns that makes sense given our cost of capital, both on an IRR and an NPV type basis. So typically what we find is that if we are doing a Greenfield like northern Virginia, you are kind of in the 14%-15% internal rate of return. And when we do the acquisitions, it is that we are pretty disciplined if we look at something that’s north of 11%. So it is a little bit - it's fair that when you are buying something with revenue already attached to it, it is a little bit lower in terms of internal rate of return; but on the other side is, you are taking less risk, right. Because it's coming across with customers. So when we look at it, we first look at it on an NPV and IRR basis and we also look at the cost of acquiring a megawatt versus what it costs us to build it out. So we kind of look at two different lenses and that goes without saying as we only focus on high quality assets. And high quality assets is not just the physical aspect of the building, but it's also that the absorption rates we see in the markets that they operate in. So we are really excited about, for instance, the Credit Suisse, and we look forward to closing that because London and Singapore are amongst the best markets globally in terms of absorption and specifically the London operation is in the [Floyd] [ph] estate, which is a great location. And Denver is also in the top ten markets. A great question.
Stuart Brown: Yes. The only thing I would add real quickly, Stuart, is that if you look at it on a replacement cost basis, which Bill touched on, FORTRUST, we paid about $13 million per megawatt. And you need to remember, this 85% lease. So that in itself is good and then the cost to build out the future capacity is actually -- that’s $6 million a megawatt. So you sort of think about where the replacement cost is, we feel really good about this investment as well for instance.
Operator: The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: So why are you guys not giving guidance out for '18? Again, usually you have been doing that ever since I have been covering you. Just why are you not giving it out now?
Stuart Brown: Shlomo, this is Stuart. I will take that one. Since I have just joined a year ago when we issued guidance at the third quarter. So what you are seeing is that -- and you see sort of some of the things have changed even now in terms of how the business changes from February to March. And the end of the day, we have given 2020 outlook out there at our investor day. So you have got a little bit of a roadmap to work from already. And we would be able to give the most appropriate guidance, it's really better for us to get 2017 closed out to what final results are, tax rates, things like that. So in February we will be able to give a better quality guidance in the sense of number of business decisions that have been made. So this is something we talked about really back in the first quarter already. I think actually in the fourth quarter last year we had mentioned this.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: So did you say anything -- I missed something about adjusted EBITDA set up for, I thought you said for '18. Did you make any comments about the EBITDA for '18 or I just misheard that.
Stuart Brown: Yes. I mean basically I said consistent with the 2020 plan that we expect EBITDA margins would be 50 to 75 basis points higher in '18 relative to '17.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: I mean based on what I am seeing in terms of both the transformation, the integration, some of the pricing, that sounds like kind of a low ball number to me.
Stuart Brown: No. We will give more detailed guidance in February. We are just trying to lay out the roadmap with what the 2020 plan is and that’s consistent with that.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And can you just talk a little bit more about the North American volumes. You are negative by two-tenths of a percent, last quarter one tenth of a percent. Excuse me, this quarter one tenth of a percent to last quarter. I think you alluded a little bit to the kind of juggling between pricing and volume over there. Can you just elaborate on that a little bit more?
William Meaney: Yes, sure. Shlomo, this is Bill. So I think the best way to think about it, if you look at North America and western Europe, right. Both very similar markets in terms of level of maturity. If we look at this quarter in North America rim, we had 3.5% internal revenue storage growth and in western Europe we had 2.3%. And then if you look at the volume that’s made up that, is that in, as you pointed out, North America was negative 0.2% and western Europe was, internal volume growth of positive 2%. So this tells you where we are -- we are obviously a little bit ahead in North America than we are in Europe in terms of rolling out the revenue management system. We started rolling it out about a year ago in Europe. And what we are doing with the revenue management is optimizing it. For sure, when you adjust price it does at some point affect the speed of incoming volume from customers and you can see that a little bit happening in the divergence between North America and western Europe. But at the end of the day what we are interested in is what you eat is cash. And so we are really happy with the North American results that we had 3.5% internal storage revenue growth. And that allows us to even further optimize the CapEx because we are getting more value for stakes on the shelf, if you will. So western Europe at 2.3%, I am not saying it's bad, we are actually -- we are happy with the 2.3% internal storage revenue growth but we think there is more to come. But there is some elasticity as you try to optimize that and you can see that in the North American and western European numbers this quarter.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. That’s good color. And then just two kind of metrics type numbers. I want to get some color on, first, my calculation on the mature markets is, between pricing and mix. The west was 2.7%-2.8%. Stuart, does that look right to you? And then also for Stuart, it looks like ARDSO moved up both sequentially and year-over-year. May be you could give us a little color on what's going on there.
Stuart Brown: I missed the second question, Shlomo. Can you say it again?
Shlomo Rosenbaum: The second question is receivables days. It looks like they were up to me sequentially and year-over-year. So just wondering what's going on over there.
Stuart Brown: Yes. So the first question was specifically on developed markets?
Shlomo Rosenbaum: I was just looking at total company -- I mean the days that I am getting were 73 days versus 69 days for the last two quarters and if I look year-over-year it looks like it was 67 days last turn 3Q '16.
Stuart Brown: Yes. So on the -- going right to the first question. On the receivables, the receivables is up mostly in North America where AR is up and that’s really driven by fewer collection days that we actually had in September in the U.S. And it was up a little bit in India as well. It was the other market where receivables are up. We had a tax law change there and so what you are seeing in India is little bit of a lag in terms of getting billing out and collections done as over a pretty short period of time. You have got an entire system in India changing to new tax regulations. So that’s what's going on in the receivables. If you look at the developed markets and other international volumes which is in the appendix to the presentation, the net internal growth number there is about 0.2%.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. So we should see that reverse in the fourth quarter on receivables?
Stuart Brown: Yes. You should see some improvement in trend in the fourth quarter.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And I am sorry I have used up a lot of the time but just a pricing thing I want to confirm. Was that 2.7, 2.8 between mix and pricing sound right in developed markets.
Stuart Brown: Yes. In total that’s about right. Both North America and in Europe, yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird and Company. Please go ahead.
Andy Wittmann: Thank you for presenting the cash chart, that was very helpful. When I look at the cash chart, it looks like you took up your guidance for the year in terms of the customer inducements and customer relationship spend from $60 million from $35 million, which is a pretty decent amount, I would say. I wanted to ask you, Bill, what you are seeing in the marketplace? Was this just you guys being opportunistic on a select handful of deals or is the inducement need a little bit higher today to get those organic boxes in the door.
William Meaney: Andy, you have been watching us long enough -- it's opportunistic and you can't time these things. When the opportunity arrives, it arrives. So there is always a little bit of movement up and down in that number because it's market driven.
Andy Wittmann: Got you. And then I guess my next question was related to the Credit Suisse acquisitions. It sounds like there is already some vacancy there. Sounds like there might be a little bit more. Can you talk about the lease up plan and how long it takes to get to some level of stabilization? Maybe the way to look at it from our point of view externally is at what point do you get this to be FFO accretive.
William Meaney: Yes, it's a great question. So the nature of the Credit Suisse acquisitions because they were running these for their own [books] [ph], is think of 2018 as the year when we have to move some of their operations out, which was not data center related, and then prepare the data halls for lease. So in '18 you will see the thing slightly dilutive, and then in '19 it's flat and by 2021 it's fully stabilized. So that’s kind of the -- so already by 2019 you will see that it's flat to slightly accretive and that’s really the first year that we are able to start leasing out part of that 10 megawatt that I talked about. So 2018 is effectively creating the 10 megawatts.
Andy Wittmann: Got it. Thank you for that. Stuart, maybe one for you. I wanted to ask about, I guess sequentially here with the refinancing we got some benefit to the lease adjusted leverage ratio. Can you talk about the mechanics of the new credit agreement and how that had an impact on that reported results. I guess maybe the fundamental question there is, was it definitional? Was it mostly a definitional change or was there an improvement in the least adjusted ratio sequentially here?
Stuart Brown: Yes. The most important is, is that if it was definitional, there was a change in the definition and calculation. But what that does is it improves the overall capacity in terms of where our leverage is today and where the covenants are to build real capacity and your ability to fund future growth if we needed again to be opportunistic. Our overall goal is to continue to reduce our lease adjusted leverage ratio. But the way the mechanics work or the key mechanics on the lease adjusted leverage ratio is that to adjust for rent expense and capitalize that in the lease adjusted number. The old credit facility was eight times rent, the new facility is six times rent. So we have got annual rent of around $300 million, right. That’s reduced your overall leverage about $600 million. And the way -- the reason that that was done is essentially it was a backend way to give us credit for the value of the $28 million square feet that we actually own on balance sheet. The value of the real estate that we own is gone up since we lasted the credit facilities. We had to work out mechanism to give us credit for that and this is a way to do that.
William Meaney: Yes. Andy, the important thing about these ratios is if you look at our total level of indebtedness, it's actually pretty consistent with our peer group, both on the industrial REIT and belt storage and the data center REITs. You don’t see a big diversion. But the important thing is now at 5.5 we have a full turn against our most restrictive covenant which kicks in at 6.5. And what we have always said is, it's less about the absolute number, the 5.5 for instance, it's more about that we would like to see 1.5 over time we would like to see 1.5 to two turns of free board between our most restrictive covenant is versus our debt, it just gives us the flexibility to steward this thing. So right now, I mean the good news is we have got a full turn below where our most restrictive covenant is and over time as we have guided to, is we will see that widen to 1.5 or better.
Andy Wittmann: Very helpful and very clear. I wanted to just go one other question on some of these matters and specifically talking around the usage of the ATM. I guess since the Credit Suisse deal is going to be funded with these fresh proceeds of the ATM, is it your intend, Bill, that you have those proceeds in the door before that closes. And maybe more broadly speaking, is the ATM going to be done under a 10b-51 plan or is it going to be at management's discretion opportunistically in the marketplace.
William Meaney: It's going to be at management's discretion depending on the marketplace. I think again, looking at our balance sheet right now, we are not going to have guns to our heads to say that we are absolutely going to use the ATM to fund the Credit Suisse. Our intention is to do that and Stuart and myself in the board will make a decision on when to use the ATM but the good thing is we have the financial flexibility. So over time I think you are right. You look at a macro level, is it wasn’t a coincidence that we announced the ATM when we announced the Credit Suisse acquisition because what we said at the 2020 plan stood on its own. But we didn’t have any data center acquisitions built into that 2020 plan. So we just think an ATM is the very efficient and kind of great mechanism to fund specific acquisitions such as the Credit Suisse opportunity. So that’s our intention. It's to use the ATM to kind of match fund these tuck-in acquisitions that weren't part of the original plan, original 2020 plan. But again with our balance sheet we have the flexibility on timing. We are not kind of forced to draw down any of it [today] [ph].
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Cohen: This is Michael Cohen for Andrew. Just a quick follow up on that discussion around leverage and the ATM. I mean it seems like a lot of financing capacity or flexibility coming on board. I mean is there anything particular that’s driving that decision for more flexibility now versus some other point.
William Meaney: I think, Michael, you can fill on this -- I think the year where we see the most relevance in the ATM quite frankly is the data center space. We feel really good at the results we have been able to build on over the last three years in the data center. We are really pleased in terms of the pre-lease commitment that we had in the Northern Virginia. So we are really seeing the proof points in the markets that one plus one equals three. So the ATM at this point is mainly focused on making sure if we see other opportunities like the FORTRUST and the Credit Suisse come down to pipe, that we have a mechanism or a tool and a tool kit that allows us to do that efficiently. So again we don’t guide to acquisitions in the data center because as I pointed to out to Karen, or Sheila rather, is that we have passed on more than we executed on because we are pretty disciplined but at the same we are very pleased in terms of the traction that we are getting in that segment.
Michael Cohen: Understood, thanks. And if I could just follow one quick question around, I know we touched on this on the North America volumes. And I knew you gave some color with North America and western Europe. Did you say for North America, I just want to make sure I got this that that customer's are holding back new volumes because of pricing. Is that what I heard or...?
William Meaney: What you see is there is a relationship between organic volume growth from existing customers based on the pricing. I mean like people will determine whether or not they decide to store on side or how quickly they sent boxes in to trust to be stored depending on the price of that. Like anything else it's not completely inelastic. So we do try to optimize that and so we feel pretty good where we planned it right now and as Stuart remarked is that we expect volume going forward is as a result in North America to be kind of plus or minus with zero points as we continue to drive better results in terms of internal storage revenue growth. Because revenue growth is the thing that drives EBITDA which drives our ability to grow cash flows. It drives our ability to grow dividend. So that’s really the name of the game. So since I have been in the company this is the best result that we had in North America overall, say looking at optimization. If you look at western Europe which as I say is similar level of maturity and similar customer behavior is much stronger internal volume growth but the overall result, in other words how much price growth we are getting at the same time is lower. So we are only getting 2.3% internal storage revenue growth and going forward we will continue to look to optimize western Europe as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Karin Ford with UMFG Securities. Please go ahead.
Karin Ford: First a clarification. Stuart, did you say that there would be limited EBITDA growth looking quarter-over-quarter from 3Q to 4Q and if so, just why is that?
William Meaney: Yes. Consistent with what -- the answer is, yes, that’s what I said. And that the main reasons for that are higher integration cost that we will be incurring and will flow through adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter as well as then the fact that the shared service cost of some of the innovation spend is backend weighted. So those are two main causes. The timing of acquisitions, right. Original guidance and assumed acquisitions would be earlier in the year, so you would have picked up the EBITDA and would have incurred the integration cost by now. Obviously, you get delayed EBITDA. The other thing is you also have gotten, from a year over year standpoint, we have disposed of Russia and Ukraine. It isn't sequentially but year-over-year basis.
Karin Ford: Right. Got it. And the $3.5 million of disaster expenses, what line item is that in on the income statement?
Stuart Brown: That is in corporate and other from a -- it's sitting in CFG. Sitting in sort of the corporate overhead costs. I am sorry, in cost of sales.
Karin Ford: Okay. Great. And then just last question is, to sum the revenue management topic, I know you said you still think you have some more wood to chop there and you are going to get some more benefit from there. But once you get at sort of rolled fully through and get your system where you want it. Is that kind of a onetime benefit or do you think that that will help elevate core organic revenue growth going forward?
William Meaney: It's a great question. We think the level that we are talking about -- if you look at 3.5% for the North America, we think that we can continue to maintain kind of north of 2.5% going forward. So there is a little bit of catch up but for the most part we feel really good that customers understand the value equation that we provide and they understand that that’s kind of an appropriate level of price increase for them. Which will just naturally over time increase our margins as well. So we feel pretty good that we can continue to push that through. I think where we still have probably the most wood to chop, as I said is Europe and developed markets. I mean we already have started chopping that year, year and half ago but it just takes longer to because visible.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh: Congratulations on the dividend boost. So you are kind of 235 existing this year. If we look at kind of the equity issuance into '18, do we maintain the 235 or is it goal to kind of keep it at the 220 that it was throughout all the 2017? Or would there be a step up commensurate with the equity issuance to keep it at that 235.
Stuart Brown: We would intend to keep the dividend rate the same, right. It's very consistent with what we said even back at investor day in terms of passing the synergies and transformation benefits back to shareholders. If you look at the dividend payout ratio, it's actually improving from what we have put out in the original guidance. So we have got plenty of capital to continue to fund the ongoing business and as Bill said, if we do think sort of our outside of the plan like the data center acquisitions, we would look to fund that either through ATM or we also have, or at least opportunities to sell some of our existing real estate to fund data center growth.
William Meaney: Yes. Just to be clear, Kevin on that is, it's very [consistent] [ph] dividend per share. So we are very focused on growing dividend per share and we only increase dividend per share when we know we can maintain that as we said we are able to do that and at the same time improve our payout ratios as a percentage of AFFO.
Kevin McVeigh: That’s helpful. And then just going back to the pricing a little bit. Bill, so if we get to kind of 2.5, if you would, is there kind of a certain level we should think about where the unit volume growth settles. So if there is kind of a tradeoff, does that get to kind of 50 basis points of decline so it's a net two, or any thought around the sensitivity because as you price the price right it looks like the new volume growth has slowed a little bit. Does that -- is there an acceptable range? Is it 50 basis points of decline or anyway to think about the sensitivity of price to volume.
William Meaney: Kevin, just to be clear, what we are talking about is internal revenue volume of storage growth. So that’s net of any pluses or minuses. So when we said we did 3.5% in North America, that’s assets are tracking out to 0.2% volume. So when Stuart guided that next year when you feel really good that we are going to be north of 2.5%, that’s 2.5% net of any up or down in terms of volume. So that’s including that. So at the end of the day which we guide on and focus on is internal revenue storage growth because that’s what you eat. Right. That’s what drives the dividend per share growth.
Kevin McVeigh: I get that. I guess I am just trying to figure out is it, hypothetically would it be three percentage points of price that gets offset by 50 basis points of volume decline that gets you in that 2.5% or.
William Meaney: No. No. I mean you don’t see that now Kevin. If you look at the overall company, is we are up in terms of volume growth and up in terms of revenue growth on an internal basis. So, no, you don’t get those types of swings.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow up from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Just wanted to follow up, just on items that were, I guess you would say taken out of the garage, Iron Cloud and Policy Center. Is there a significant startup cost on those items that, or is it going to be flowing through over the next several years as you try to grow those business. And can you give us just a little bit of color on that and how we should think of it.
William Meaney: It's a great question Shlomo. First of all, as we look at both of those things, a lot of the original startup cost has already been come through. There is a little bit more development that we still have to do or we are doing on Iron Cloud to add more features to it. But that’s kind of on a go forward basis. I mean where I see the bigger investment in both of those things is on the go to market side which typically have a shortage of patient period. I mean if we see an opportunity to ramp that up, we will talk about that on guidance in February for '18. But specifically for those two, most of where I would call the development cost, a little bit still ongoing which is about say building out more features, is pretty much done. And you have seen that in the lower service margins, in the EBITDA margins in data management process which was a reflection of some of the expense that we have done to launch Iron Cloud but still it was 53% but it's lower versus a year ago. But I think if we do make investments in either of those areas next year, it's more in the go to market side.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: And what you talked about [adjacent] [ph], I mean I am just trying to think about what are you looking for because there are newer things that you are rolling out and clearly when there is a go to market and something like that, there is an investment that’s going to show up on the numbers. When you are looking for a return on something like that, like what's the time that you expect to see like a material return on something like that.
William Meaney: These things are pretty quick, right, because of just the nature and the size of the investment. And then if you look at pure market investment is that you are definitely getting a payback within two years and in some cases it's within a year. To be honest with it, the thing that we are looking at more on things like Iron Cloud because the market interest, and we have been getting a lot of positive feedback from some of the technical analysts on these things is it's more like the question is, is it something we can build and also do we need to use partners to really execute -- to take advantage of the opportunity. So those are kind of decisions we are going through. But on the go to market side you generally see fairly quick payback. It's definitely within two years and lots of times within the year that you make them.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. We currently have no more questions.
William Meaney: Thank you, operator, and good evening for those in United States and good morning to all those here in Australia. Thanks a lot.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Melissa Marsden - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you and welcome everyone to our Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. The user-controlled slides that we will be referring to today in our prepared remarks are available on our Investor Relations website, along with the link to today's webcast. You can find the presentation at ironmountain.com under About Us/Investors/Events & Presentations. Alternatively, you can access today's financial highlights, press release, the presentation and the full supplemental financial information together as one PDF file by going to investors.ironmountain.com, under Financial Information.

On this morning's call, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic plan; followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phone lines for Q&A. Referring now to page 2 of the presentation, today's earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2017 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.

In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in our supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased this morning to report strong second quarter results and our first acquisition in the data center space. We're excited about this transaction and look forward to welcoming the FORTRUST team to the Iron Mountain Family. We achieved financial performance in line with our expectations and the durability of our high-margin Records Management Storage business drove solid internal growth and enhanced profitability across the business. Our second quarter financial and operating results demonstrate solid execution of our strategic plan. As you know, that plan is focused on extending our durable business model through continued investment in our core developed markets, whilst expanding into faster-growing emerging markets and capturing opportunities to provide new, innovative solutions to both our new and existing customers and to tap into new storage-related segments such as the Data Center business. Let me start with highlights on the third slide of the earnings call presentation. Our second quarter financial results were in line with our expectations and reflect how our rapid integration of Recall and success with our Transformation initiative have significantly enhanced the Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO that support recent dividend increases and provide a solid foundation for future growth in dividend well in excess of inflation. We continue to make progress on our goal of reducing SG&A as a percentage of revenue, down 80 basis points from the first quarter to 23.4% whilst our EBITDAR margins improved 230 basis points sequentially to 33.5%. Prior to one-time items, which Stuart will detail later, the sequential improvement would have been 170 basis points or 32.9% in terms of margin. During the quarter, we also achieved internal storage rental revenue growth of 4.8%, which as noted, included a data center lease termination fee. Excluding that fee, we posted very strong internal storage rental growth of 4%. This growth reflects improvement in pricing through revenue management efforts and 1.3% growth in internal global records management volume or excluding impacts from acquisitions and dispositions. You'll note in the supplemental report that trailing 12-month volume growth now includes Recall volume in the base, rather than being held out separately as acquisition-related, which is how we have presented Recall volume for the past four quarters. As we have noted in calls over the past year, after lapping the anniversary of the acquisition, folding in Recall's volume into the base increases it by about 20%, which has the impact of making all percentage growth figures a bit lower, even though there is little to no change on an absolute basis. Slide 4 shows the absolute volume change for total records management storage. Importantly, new volume from both existing and new customers of 50 million cubic feet over the past 12 months is up from 44 million cubic feet of new volume over the 12-month period prior to the Recall acquisition. This demonstrates the benefit of the transaction and consistency of customer behavior related to storage of new regulatory and legal documents. And remember that the 9 million cubic feet of net record growth stays with us for an average of 15 years. Based on the strength of our core fundamentals, we remain comfortable with our full-year revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO guidance for 2017. Whilst we benefited from some one-time items in the second quarter, our expectations are unchanged. Stuart will have more on the pluses and minuses shortly. Slide 5 is a review of progress during the quarter against our 2020 strategic plan. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we achieved internal storage revenue growth of 3.4% and 1.8 million cubic feet of net internal volume growth in developed markets on a trailing 12-month basis. We are pleased with the durability of volume growth and our ability to achieve price gains in the developed markets. In addition, we continued to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in developed markets, closing on four tuck-in deals in North America, including an acquisition of a small shredding business. In terms of expanding our business model into faster growing emerging markets, we are just shy of 18% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis, a major improvement from about 10% just three years ago. Year-over-year progress against this goal was supported by acquisitions closed during the quarter, including those in the remaining markets that were part of the Santa Fe deal, namely Indonesia, India and the Philippines. We also closed on a transaction in Peru during the second quarter. In total, we invested $27 million in emerging markets in Q2, which includes some real estate assets. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on a $29 million acquisition in Cyprus. We continued to nurture a strong pipeline of M&A opportunities and are maintaining our full year guidance for acquisition investment independent of the data center acquisition announced this morning, which I'll address in just a minute. Also, during the second quarter, we sold our business in Russia and Ukraine to OSG, a leading records management provider in Russia. We remain confident in the long-term attractiveness of the market opportunity and growth characteristics of these countries and will continue to participate through a passive 25% minority interest in the combined entity. We believe that owning a stake in the OSG business that now includes Iron Mountain customers and operations is the best value-creating strategy at this time. Turning to slide 6, we meaningfully advanced our adjacent business strategy with the signing of an agreement to acquire FORTRUST, a Denver-based data center company, for approximately $128 million, which we announced earlier this morning. This acquisition adds 9 megawatts of existing capacity and allows for significant future expansion. Together with the first phase of our data center campus in Northern Virginia that goes online next month, we will have a total existing capacity of more than 30 megawatts by the end of the year. Adding the expansion potential from FORTRUST, full build-out of our Northern Virginia campus and construction in progress in our Boyers and Kansas City locations, we have the potential to expand our data center platform to more than 70 megawatts. FORTRUST is a great fit with our business. It is highly regarded private data center operator with a distinction of having 100% critical systems uptime throughout its 15-year history. And FORTRUST's focus on enhanced security and consistent accessibility for critical applications is very consistent with our brand positioning in targeted verticals. It has a diversified base of more than 250 customers, with the top 25 representing about 50% of annualized rental revenue. In addition, Denver is quite attractive as a critical location for customers seeking East-West data center redundancy and the market is seeing solid demand driven by the technology solutions, data management, software, education and healthcare industries. The acquisition, including the real estate, represents a multiple of approximately 13 times stabilized EBITDA and will be funded with a combination of cash and unregistered stock issued to the seller. Assuming this deal is funded with approximately $73.5 million worth of equity at or near the current stock price, it would be $0.01 per share to $0.02 per share dilutive to EPS in 2017 and neutral to AFFO. We expect it to be accretive to EPS in year two or 2019. Our year-end run rate revenue mix following this data center transaction will bring adjacent business to roughly 3% of total revenue relative to be at 5% by 2020. Combined with the growth in our emerging markets, we are well positioned to meet our goal of 25% of total revenues from our higher growth portfolio by 2020. In summary, we had a solid quarter characterized by good operating fundamentals, strong financial performance, improved profitability and excellent progress in all three pillars of our strategic plan. We continued to identify attractive investment opportunities that both strengthen the durability of the core business and drive growth in new businesses. This progress supports growth in Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow that ultimately underpins our ability to grow our dividend per share and to delever over time. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report on another strong quarter of healthy continuing growth in our core Records Management business. This morning, I'll provide some color on our quarter's operational and financial drivers and then cover our outlook for 2017. As you see on slide 7, which shows our key financial metrics, our second quarter total revenues grew 8.4% on a C$ basis and were modestly impacted by delayed closings of acquisitions compared to our original outlook. As Bill mentioned, we achieved strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 4.8% in the second quarter, or 4% excluding a lease termination fee from a data center customer whose business had been acquired. Service revenues increased 5.1% in the second quarter on a C$ basis with internal service revenue down 1.1% as higher paper prices in our Shred business this year were more than offset by cycling over a high Recall destruction revenue a year ago in our Other International segment and less tape rotation in our Data Management business. As noted last quarter, we will be cycling against last year's paper price increases in the second half. So at current paper pricing, we don't anticipate further upside this year. With year-to-date internal service revenue growth of minus 0.4%, we continue to be comfortable with our outlook for flattish internal service revenue growth for the full year. Selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues were down 230 basis points year-over-year and decreased 80 basis points from the first quarter, driven by transformation and integration progress and excluding Recall integration costs. Our Adjusted EBITDA grew by 23% on a C$ basis in the second quarter. Excluding the additional month of Recall in our 2017 results compared with last year, growth was about 18% due to solid operational execution and acquisition synergies, resulting in margin improvement across all our regions. In addition, results benefited from almost $6 million of non-recurring items this quarter, including the data center lease termination fee just mentioned and the reversal of an earn-out provision on a previous acquisition. I'll speak to our Adjusted EBITDA outlook in a few minutes. But at a high level, we expect these favorable items to be largely offset by integration costs associated with acquisition activity in the second half, as well as a loss of EBITDA from the sale of our Russian and Ukrainian businesses. Looking at the Adjusted EBITDA margin on a sequential basis, that is to attract progress on synergies and transformation, the Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 230 basis points from the first quarter, driven by top-line growth, gross margin improvement, acquisition synergies, the overhead improvement and to a lesser extent the nonrecurring items. Compared to a year ago, the Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 390 basis points to 33.5%, of which about 60 basis points was due to the nonrecurring items. AFFO was $217 million in the second quarter, an increase of almost $62 million or about 40% on a C$ basis. This strong growth resulted from growth in Adjusted EBITDA, timing of maintenance capital expenditures, as well as a swing in the timing of quarterly cash taxes compared to a year ago of about $14 million. Remember that annually, cash taxes will generally reflect our structural tax rate. But we will have some quarterly volatility. Year-to-date, cash taxes have been just a little bit lower than our expected annual run rate. Let's turn to slide 8 to cover internal growth performance by segment for the quarter. In the North America Records and Information Management business, internal storage revenue grew by 3.7%. This growth was largely driven by higher average price, as reported internal volume growth was flat. North American internal service revenue growth of 1.3% resulted from higher revenues from Information Governance, or Digital Imaging Services, shred activity and paper pricing, and other project-based revenue. The North America RIM Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 400 basis points to 43.3%. As you can see on this slide, the total North America RIM business represents over 50% of total revenues. The strong growth in this segment has a significant impact on overall growth. The North America Data Management business trends were in line with the first quarter, with internal storage revenue growth of 2.9%. Internal service revenue declined about $2 million due to the ongoing reduction in tape rotation. While the internal service revenue decline on a percentage basis is more noticeable in Data Management compared to other segments, remember that Data Management service is just 3.4% of total revenues. Further, new services are just beginning to offset these declines, but we expect it will be some time before the tape handling declines are fully offset. The Adjusted EBITDA margin in North America Data Management declined slightly from a year ago as a result of increased investments in product development. However, the margins remained a very healthy 53.4%. The internal storage revenue growth in Western Europe improved 2.5%, up from the first quarter, reflecting good revenue management efforts. The internal service revenue decline of 1.7% or less than $1 million was due mainly to a lower contribution from Data Management and fewer destruction projects in the UK. In the Other International segment, which includes the larger legacy Recall Australian business, we continue to see strong storage internal revenue growth of 7.1% and improving margins. Service internal growth in this segment was impacted by the high level of Recall destruction projects underway a year ago. The Adjusted EBITDA margin in Other International was 29.2% in the second quarter, continuing to improve year-over-year. Remember that this segment, representing emerging markets plus Recall's larger Australian and New Zealand business, now account for over 20% of total revenues. In our Corporate and Other segment, we recorded the lease termination fee in our Data Center business, that drove a very high internal storage growth on a percentage basis given the small base. The Fine Arts Storage business also had a strong quarter driven by new sales leadership and implementation of enhanced sales management tools, as well as a focus on customer retention and operational efficiencies. Touching on slide 9 quickly, this shows the relative size of each segment by product line and the contribution to our results through a storage and service lens. Storage provides over 80% of Adjusted gross profit with the remainder from service. We continue to innovate on new offerings for our customers focusing on value-added services, which deliver gross profit growth. Before turning to our outlook for 2017, let me quickly touch on the composition of our global business as well as our balance sheet. Remember that roughly 70% of Adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. is in U.S. dollars, demonstrating the limited impact foreign exchange fluctuations have on our results. Also, we continued to match our foreign-denominated debt to create natural currency hedges to mitigate translation exposure, while also being tax-efficient. At quarter end, 23% of our debt is in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In keeping with this focus, in May, we completed a €300 million senior unsecured note offering. We had great execution resulting in a transaction that was historically significant, and we believe that at a 3% coupon was the second lowest coupon ever for a reverse Yankee issuance. This reflects bondholders' understanding of the health of our business, durability of cash flows and strength of our balance sheet. We're keeping a close eye on market conditions and may have additional opportunities for refinancing activity later this year. We maintain liquidity of nearly $1.3 billion at quarter end and our lease-Adjusted debt ratio remained at 5.8 times, which is in line with our expectations. Let's turn to our guidance for 2017 summarized on page 10 of the results presentation. Our core outlook remains unchanged on a constant dollar basis. However, we are updating underlying assumptions for the acquisition of FORTRUST and increased our internal revenue growth expectations for storage. With our strong first half internal growth momentum, we now anticipate internal storage rental revenue growth to range from 2.5% to 3% for the year, an increase of 50 basis points driven by both volume growth and pricing improvement. Our EBITDA guidance is unchanged. As noted earlier, we had $6 million of onetime benefits in the second quarter, which we expect to be offset by the timing of acquisition activity and the divestment of our Russian and Ukrainian businesses. In addition, our shared service implementation costs as well as investments in data technology and consumer storage are weighted to the second half of the year. Therefore, after a strong sequential increase in Adjusted EBITDA, we expect a flatter progression of growth from here to the end of the year. Regarding AFFO, our range of guidance for the full year is unchanged with maintenance CapEx and cash taxes increasing in the second half of the year relative to the first half. With the FORTRUST acquisition expected to close in the third quarter, we haven't Adjusted EBITDA or EPS guidance ranges given that we will have only a partial year contribution of results and will incur integration costs. We don't intend to exclude these integration costs from our Adjusted EBITDA definition in the same manner as we do for Recall costs, as this is more of an ordinary course acquisition in terms of size. Also, the partial year addition to revenue from this deal would be subsumed within our guidance range. However, from an investment standpoint, we are assuming an additional $128 million of growth capital, of which $73.5 million funded from the private placement of shares to the seller based on the average price prior to closing. Therefore, our outlook reflects an increase of about 2 million shares outstanding or roughly 1 million shares on the 2017 weighted average share count. Turning to slide 11, our projected cash available for distribution and investments, or CAD, also remains unchanged other than for FORTRUST. For 2017, we continue to expect CAD to cover our anticipated full-year dividend and required maintenance capital expenditures, with approximately $120 million of capital remaining to support core growth racking and other discretionary value-creating investments. The private placement of shares and borrowings will fund the estimated $345 million needed for growth investments including FORTRUST and excluding Recall costs. Slide 12 shows the same information, but in a sources and uses format based on our AFFO guidance for the year. As we can see, AFFO, which by definition adds back non-cash items and deducts maintenance CapEx, covers the dividend, as well as acquisitions of customer relationships and inducements with the same $120 million of cash remaining. That $120 million plus debt and private placement equity as shown is adequate to address the investment in FORTRUST, our existing data center development plus acquisitions, real estate investments and innovation. Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and remain well positioned to deliver on our financial projections for the year, having maintained strong internal growth momentum. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before we open up for Q&A.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Stuart. Just a couple of high-level comments before we turn it over to Q&A. First, we have had a very strong quarter in terms of the financials perspective, 4% internal storage revenue growth, year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion of 330 basis points excluding all the one-time items and strong AFFO growth which continues to drive dividend growth and to deleverage the business. Second, incoming trailing 12-month volume growth has gone from 44 million cubic feet to 50 million cubic feet after absorbing Recall, showing the robustness and quality of the business, the physical storage side. And third, we've made significant progress in building our higher growth segment aided by M&A, both in the emerging markets and now in the data center space. With that, I'd like to turn it over to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first questioner today is going to be Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mr. Steinerman ....
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Sorry about that. My question is within the internal storage guide, could you give us a sense of how much net pricing benefits?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Well, you can see it in terms of the – you see the difference, Andrew, between the 4% internal revenue growth and you see the increase in volume. So you can kind of – we don't do it on a like-for-like basis as always, one's on a trailing 12 month and one's quarter-over-quarter but ...
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: ...but you can kind of see that we're getting significantly more price than we have in the past.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. And last question. On the internal guide of 2.5% to 3% for the year, are you counting second quarter as 4.0% or the higher number?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: We are counting the second quarter as a 4.0% because we're stripping out the SimpliVity termination when HP bought them.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question for today is going to be Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask a question on the FORTRUST acquisition. First as a clarification, you are buying the real estate as part of this deal? And then secondly, the 13 times pricing on synergized EBITDA, what's included in that synergized EBITDA?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. So, we – so Karin, we are buying the real estate – we're buying the whole business including the real estate.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: And the 13 time synergize is after also building out the additional 7 megawatts of capacity.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: And fully leasing...
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. Karin, it's just to clarify. It's really – so it's the – if you look at the current run rate of EBITDA with the leases that they have in place, if there are – we have couple leases signed that haven't taken occupancy yet. And the synergize also, there is a little bit of synergies, not a lot. And then a build out of some of the existing spaces and it's not the future development space.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. Does it include getting the 75% leased portion up to call it stabilization...
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. It's stable – fully stabilized yield which is if you look at sort of a 95% occupancy, you're going to get a yield there of call it 12%.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: ...on the initial purchase and then obviously a higher yield on the future development.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. Great. Second question is just on the Northern Virginia Data Center. Can you just talk about leasing progress on that and when you would expect to hit stabilization on that development as well? development as well?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Originally, we've guided that it will take us about three years to get stabilized on that. I think it will be a bit faster than that. But I think in terms of pre-leasing activity, we had a few small customers already coming, but we had a lot of people, in fact this week, we had a tour of someone looking at both Northern Virginia as well as Denver. He's looking for in the new order of a couple of megawatts at both facilities. So, we feel pretty good in terms of where the interest in terms of that facility. We've already had quite a few sales tours, looking at that and it comes online as said in the middle of August.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Great. Last question is just for Stuart, on debt to EBITDA and you said the 5.8 time, this quarter was in-line with your expectations, are you still expecting to get debt to EBITDA down to 5.6 times at year-end or has that target changed with the incremental acquisitions you've made this quarter?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It'll still be around 5.6 times, you've got to remember, we've funded it – the seller actually wanted to take Iron Mountain stock and so we were able to fund that with the basically same leverage ratio as the existing balance sheet.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question is going to be Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird and Company. Please go ahead.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. I guess, I'd maybe ask a couple of questions here on service to start out with. I noticed that North American Rim service was plus 1.3%, that's continuing a trend of relatively positive results. Are you working on any large projects that are happening here in the last couple of quarters or this rate of service growth in North American Rim is sustainable?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. No, I think it's more than sustainable and, in fact, although these were more in Western Europe, we had a few projects that have slipped into the third quarter, because the timing on these things is never exact. So we feel pretty good about the pipeline on the service side. And as you can see, the North American was naturally our primary focus in terms of getting our service pipeline built up because it's by far the largest portion of our service revenue. Most of it comes from North America, but we see good progress across the spectrum looking at Europe and also data management in terms of building the pipeline.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: The one thing I'll add is that the first half was helped by the higher paper prices that we will be cycling against. It started to increase last year August, September.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess, Stuart, on the financial statement, I just noticed in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation as well as the Adjusted EPS reconciliation there is the other income line actually had a pretty significant number. I think it was like almost $40 million in EBITDA and $0.07 in EPS. So I was just wondering if you could give us some detail as to what that is?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's really all boiled down to FX and the change in FX in the quarter, and you can see that impact also in the supplemental where we go back and adjust FX out of that in the, what is that on page, pull it up real quick, but you can see it was about a 1% impact in the second quarter in terms of growth rates, and so that just flows through to the other.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Final question here just on the guidance. I just want to understand, check my understanding of this. On the FORTRUST acquisition, it sounded like the income statement impact because it's partial year or whatever it gets absorbed in the range, but the capital structure impact is in fact included in the guidance that you've given today. Is that right?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: That's correct. That's correct. So even as Karin asked a few minutes ago, even with that, we can keep getting the leverage down close to 5.6%.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And I can't imagine Russia, Ukraine was too much revenue, but what was the annualized revenue from that, if you don't mind us asking?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It was about $12 million. In the year, the impact was about $12 million, so an annualized basis call it $15 million or $16 million of annualized revenue, maybe $18 million...
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Maybe $18 million.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: $18 million annualized impact on revenue.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And the next question today is going to be Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, Stuart, can you just walk through kind of some of the give and takes in the quarter? I guess starting on revenue, onetime benefit from a lease termination, I think you said that was $6 million. What was the in-quarter impact negative from disposition of Russia, Ukraine?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. So the in-quarter impact was pretty small; the impact for rest of the year, so it was probably about a $0.5 million impact on negative impact on EBITDA. You'll end up seeing a piece of that in the second half actually flow through sort of other income, right, because now we have a 25%, we will maintain a 25% investment, so as a minority, so it comes out of EBITDA, but we continue to remain invested in Russia. So you'll end up picking some of that back up from an EPS and AFFO standpoint. But
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: What about revenue?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: ...of the $6 million the biggest piece of that was the lease termination fee and it was about $2 million impact from the other – from the accrued earn-out that we ended up not paying.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, but – how much, I know you said $0.5 a million impact on EBITDA on the quarter from Russia, Ukraine. How much was the Russia impact?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I mean, that's the biggest piece of it. We don't breakout EBITDA by country, so.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. What I am trying to get is that there, if I'm trying to normalize the revenue for the quarter so if we take out $6 million from the termination plus the accrued in that earn out, I also wonder if we have to remove any disposition, so I'm looking on a go-forward basis. So, what should I remove for the dispositions?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, this would be just under our smallest about a half – okay, so this is a disposition about a $0.5 million and the lease termination was about $4 million of the $6 million.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then...
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: And those are two adjustments, those are the normalizations you should make.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then for a currency headwind in the quarter what was the aggregate currency headwind during the quarter in from the company?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah that's – it is on slide 7 of the supplemental, it was about 1%, it was – yeah, about 1% impact.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then the termination fee was because it compare the – the client got bought out and someone moved the business elsewhere?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, HP bought SimpliVity, here in Boston and then they moved it into their data center, they had the excess data center space so they is part of that acquisition they move SimpliVity out, but they paid out the contract.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then if I go ahead and look at the internal storage volume growth on the pages where you have those borrower's bars, it looks like they are below trend a little bit before the Recall acquisition. So, if I go back, it just looks like North America and other international just seems to be a little bit lower than they were before the four large borrower's bars with the – with Recall, I want to know if there is any commentary on that?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: That's just increasing the base, I mean it's the – because now the base is 20% bigger than it was before with Recall volume in there.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, I should divide it by 0.8 to get kind of a more normalized of what I should think about it?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: No, not really let me get it – your – we're sort of try to talk about it from a volume basis, right. The volume is up and as you can see that in the that in the charts in the earnings presentation, but your denominator like your base of what you're comparing that growth to, that 9 million cubic feet over the last four quarters, is your growth that you're dividing that by 20% figure base, so you can't just take that – we can't just take that times 0.8 normalized.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. I think, I mean, I think the way I would think about modeling on a go forward basis is do it around the absolute, right. In other words, the new absolute. We said that over trailing 12 months we have gone from $44 million to $50 million of incoming volume. So, I would kind of think about it in terms of the absolute rather than just try to mess around with the percentages.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. All right. I'll just probe that a little more offline, but just if you go to page 28 of this supplemental, there is this bar chart that looks like volume has been coming down and I was just wondering if you can give us if you look at top left like year-over-year growth in units' storage, in records management storage portfolio in cubic feet, can you just explain to us what that is exactly, I guess it's down 2.1%
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. So that utilization, you got to remember that the divestments are in that as well. So, you get impacted by the disposals that we've done related to the Recall transaction. So, those divestments as well as Russia right, so go down even in Q1 because of the divestments.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. So it's all divestment related?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's what I'm getting to. Okay, pretty good. Thank you.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think the divestments is about 14 million impact cumulative, yeah – yeah 14 million cu was the impact.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So, then it would have been flat, if I put it together just year-over-year?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. It would have been up a little bit, but...
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: One of the areas that we continue to improve through our real estate consolidation. So, generally the trend line is moving up, but you have to take out this one off.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. All right, I'll ask you more offline on that. But, thank you very much.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And our next questioner today is Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Hey, I wonder if you could just a following up on Andrew's question. The boost of the storage internal on the pricing side, was that primarily step up in pricing on Recall or was that across the base business?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's across the base business, we've been -- Kevin we've been, as you know that you can plan the stores while they – we started building up our revenue management expertise probably three years ago. And it takes a while for that to bleed through just the natural tenure of our contracts and we're really starting to make – you starting to see the progress that we've been working on three years now starting to bleed through into the pricing across the business.
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it, got it. And then just on the slide 11, where you talk about the cash available for the FORTRUST, is it the full $130 million or should we adjust it for the private placement of stocks, till maybe to not $350 million, it should be the $345 million or so less the price, private placement or in terms of incremental capital or is that, I am thinking in terms of cash need?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: $345 million is not our cash right, as we've been talking about in investor day, there are different things that we can do to fund our growth, obviously borrowing is a piece of it, if you can see clearly on the next slide you got the private placement of debt and we've also even got capital recycling. So, we continue to do some real estate investment as well, that you don't really see above the service, above the surface, because we are selling some real estate to acquire real estate in better locations or where we want to grow.
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. So, that's all, all different avenues in terms of funding?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, if you look at the next slide, if you look at slide 12, we can clearly see sort of Yeah. If you look at the next slide. If you look at slide 12, you can clearly see the sort of funding it shows the source of expectation.
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: There look to be no further questions. So, this will conclude the Q&A session and today's conference call.

Executives: Melissa Marsden - Iron Mountain, Inc. William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc. Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.
Analysts: Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc. Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Melissa Marsden - Iron Mountain, Inc.: (00:31-00:40) include a short slide presentation that will be referenced during today's prepared remarks. The user-controlled slides are available on our Investor Relations website, along with the link to today's webcast. You can find the presentation at ironmountain.com under About Us/Investors/Events & Presentations. Alternatively, you can access today's financial highlights, press release, the presentation and the full supplemental financial information together in one PDF file by going to investors.ironmountain.com, under Financial Information. Additionally, we have filed all the related documents as 1-8K, which is also available on the website. On today's call, we'll hear first from Bill Meaney, Iron Mountain's President and CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic plan; followed by Stuart Brown, our CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. Referring now to page 2 of the presentation, today's earnings call, slide presentation and supplemental financial information will contain forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2017 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the earnings commentary, safe harbor language on this slide, and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP financial measures when presenting our results, and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in our supplemental financial information. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report solid first quarter results. We achieved financial performance in line with our expectations, underpinned by the durability of and the consistent growth in our high-margin records management storage business. We are particularly pleased by the strong top line growth seen across the business. We also continue to demonstrate progress in building positive momentum in the service side of the business as we grow new offerings to offset legacy transport services. Overall, we performed well against our strategic plan. At its core, our strategic plan is about extending our durable business model through continued investment in our large and developed market core, whilst expanding into faster-growing emerging markets, and seizing opportunities to provide new innovative storage solutions to both our existing customers, as well as new segments. As most of you are aware, last week, we hosted our Investor Day in New York, featuring several members of the senior executive team responsible for delivering results across our reporting segments. The event included breakout sessions that provided insights into how we approach innovation, and a peek into the garage to highlight some of our current initiatives. Given that the content from that event is so fresh, and our first quarter results are consistent with the trends and trajectory we discussed last week, we'll keep our prepared remarks brief. If you weren't able to join us in person last week, the webcast replay, presentation slides and transcript of our Investor Day are all available on our website. I would encourage you to review those materials as that form allows for a deeper dive, as well as exposure to additional members of the management team than can be accomplished in a typical earnings call or a one-on-one meeting. During Investor Day, we also touched on how our rapid integration of Recall transaction and success with our transformation initiative have significantly enhanced the adjusted EBITDA and AFFO that support recent dividend increases, and are providing a solid foundation for future growth in dividends in excess of inflation. Turning to first quarter highlights, on the third page of the earnings call presentation, total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and core storage fundamentals were in line with our expectations, both on an internal and total basis. And we continued to make progress on our goal of reducing SG&A as a percentage of revenue, reaching 24.2%, down 100 basis points from last year, and down 30 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. We also achieved storage internal revenue growth in Q1 of 3%, with positive internal volume growth in all reporting segments and a worldwide average of 1.9%. New volume from existing customers of more than 34 million cubic feet over the past 12 months was consistent with what we've achieved in recent years and included the expected increase from Recall. This demonstrates the consistency of customer behavior related to storage of new regulatory and legal documents. We continue to maintain our focus on driving volume growth, whilst also beginning to realize some improvement in pricing through revenue management efforts. Based on the strength of these core fundamentals, we remain comfortable with our 2017 full-year guidance. Slide 4 is a quick review of progress against our 2020 strategic plan during the quarter. In developed markets, which includes both North America in RIM and our Western European segment, we continue to drive positive internal storage revenue growth with 3.2 million cubic feet of internal volume growth on a trailing 12-month basis. In terms of our progress with expanding our business model into faster-growing emerging markets, we are just shy of 18% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis, a major improvement from about 10% just 3 years ago. Year-over-year progress against this goal was supported by acquisitions closed during the quarter. Also noted last week, our pipeline is substantial and provides solid coverage of what we need to execute to bring emerging markets to 20% of total revenue by the end of 2020. In adjacent businesses, we continue to see attractive opportunities in our Data Center business, as discussed last week. During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of a small art storage business in Brooklyn that has a long history of providing storage and transport services to prominent collectors, gallery owners and museums in the New York metro market. Combining expansion in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses, we made further progress in Q1 with shifting our revenue mix in line with our 2020 plan goal, as noted on slide 5. Our objective is to reach 25% of total revenues from our higher growth portfolio. Supported by the acquisition of Recall, we are approaching 20% of our mix coming from these businesses. As previously noted, our guidance includes M&A, as well as strong organic growth to support this transition, both in emerging markets, as well as in adjacent businesses. As this shift progresses, we expect to see faster EBITDA growth. Our progress in shifting our revenue mix, along with the benefits from both Recall integration and our transformation initiative, can be seen in the year-over-year comparisons of financial performance on slide 6. We've substantially integrated Recall's business and implemented actions that enabled us to achieve synergies faster than our original expectations, and we have enhanced EBITDA growth through our transformation efforts. The financial impact from these efforts is flowing through. As stated on our fourth quarter earnings call and noted again last week, we expect to generate $180 million of combined savings benefit for 2017, with roughly $20 million of that to be reinvested into innovation, operating expenditures and shared service efficiency programs. Whilst integration is largely complete on a management and culture basis, we remain on track to add another $50 million of bottom line benefit from transformation, bringing the total from these two efforts to $230 million by 2020. As you can see, the weighted average increase in our shares outstanding year-over-year is roughly in line with revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-20% range. Additionally, we increased our quarterly dividend per share by 13% in the fourth quarter, so the majority of this improvement is going directly to shareholders without compromising future growth. Turning to slide 7, we're all familiar with the link between rising interest rates in REIT public market valuations, and the additional correlation between rising interest rates and rising inflation. Given that we are a real estate company generating more than 80% of our gross profit from storage rental related activity, we believe we are unique among REITs in our ability to pass through inflation in the form of upward-only, CPI-type escalators in our contracts. Typically, these are annual escalation provisions. Additionally, the fact that our storage gross margins are around 75%, inflation escalators have a positive and compound effect on margins, especially during periods of high inflation. I would add that the shorter term rental contracts are balanced against our average box age of 15 years and 98% customer retention. So, the average customer stays with us for 50 years, supporting the durability of the rental income stream. Remember that rising interest rates don't have an impact on customer storage demand, and the net operating income doesn't change if the market value of the underlying real estate fluctuates. In summary, we had a very good first quarter, and we continue to execute on all three pillars of our strategic plan. In the short term, these accomplishments support both the reinvestment necessary to extend the durability of our business, and continue growth in cash flow and our ability to grow our dividend. This is all whilst continuing to advance our growth in EBITDA ahead of debt, and hence, de-lever over time, and concurrently, continuing to create value through our M&A activities. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be reporting on another strong quarter that demonstrates the durability of our business and the success of our business plans. Similar to Bill, my comments will be brief this morning and cover key highlights, certain operational and financial metrics, and our outlook for 2017, which remains unchanged since February. Before diving into the details, let me walk you through the key financial highlights. First, we achieved strong internal storage revenue growth of 3%, excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions. This is consistent with last quarter's performance of 2.9%, and reflects solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets. Second, we maintain consistent adjusted EBITDA growth of over 24% from the acquisition of Recall and underlying margin improvement. Third, the integration of Recall and our Transformation Program continues to be on track, as evidenced by the 100 basis point decline in SG&A as a percentage of total revenue this quarter, as Bill discussed. Let's now turn to slide 8, which shows our key financial metrics. First quarter total revenues growth of 25.1% was in line with our expectations, driven by acquisitions and the strong internal storage revenue growth. The internal storage revenue growth of 3% was driven primarily by net internal records management volume growth of 1.9%, as well as benefits from our revenue management efforts. Service revenues increased 26.6% in the first quarter, 0.6% of which was internal growth. The improvement in internal service growth resulted from higher paper prices, as well as increases in project-related revenue. At current paper pricing, we expect to benefit to the first half of the year until we begin to cycle against last year's price increases. Compared to a year ago, the first quarter adjusted gross margin declined 120 basis points due to the mix of Recall's lower margins, including higher rent expense, as pre-acquisition Recall leased close to 90% of their facilities on a square-foot basis. Sequentially, adjusted gross margins declined 80 basis points from the fourth quarter as a result of the seasonality of utility cost and compensation expense. Adjusted to exclude Recall integration costs, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20.1% from a year ago. SG&A as a percent of total revenues, however, decreased 100 basis points from last year due to the transformation integration benefits, as well as a reduction of bad debt expense. The 24.4% increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by acquisition benefits, top line growth and the SG&A improvements just noted. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by $6 million of expense this quarter related to the innovation investments, which we talked about last quarter. As a percentage of total revenues, the adjusted EBITDA margin in Q1 was 31.2%, 10 basis points lower than a year ago due to the mix of Recall's lower-margin business, mostly offset by other business improvements. Looking at the adjusted EBITDA margin on a sequential basis, that is to track progress on synergies and transformation, the EBITDA margin declined 50 basis points from Q4, due partly to the seasonally higher operating expenses in the first quarter, as well as the $6 million of expense-related innovation. Excluding just for the $6 million, adjusted EBITDA would have been 31.8%, up 10 basis points sequentially from Q4 2016. Growth of adjusted EPS to $0.24 per diluted share for the quarter was negatively impacted by $0.03 related to the year-over-year increase in our structural tax rate, which was 14% a year ago and 23.1% this quarter. The tax rate was above our guidance, partly driven by a change in U.K. tax legislation, whose application was recently clarified. The legislation affects our interest deductibility, and we have included this in our effective tax rate, while we are actively pursuing remediation and restructuring to mitigate its impact. In addition, our tax rate has been impacted by our anticipated mix of earnings. Despite our Q1 structural rate, we expect that our full year 2017 structural rate will be closer to the higher end of our guidance, or approximately 20%. AFFO was in line with our expectations at $170.9 million. Compared to a year ago, AFFO growth was limited as we lapped against a cash tax benefit, resulting in a $34 million swing in cash taxes paid. Remember that the calculation of AFFO was changed in the third quarter of last year, so that it reflects cash taxes. While annually, cash taxes will generally reflect our structural tax rate, we will have some quarterly volatility, such as this quarter when AFFO is reduced by a net $30.4 million compared to a year ago, when cash taxes were actually a benefit of $3.6 million. Let's turn to slide 9 to cover internal growth performance by segment for the quarter. The North America records and information management, or RIM, internal storage revenue growth continued to be strong. This performance was driven by price improvement and volume growth. We saw improvement in the North American internal service revenue due to growth in the shred business, including the higher paper prices, and improvement in information governance and digital solutions, which provides digital imaging services to our customers. The North American data management internal storage revenue grew 2.7%. However, internal service revenue declined due to the ongoing reduction in tape rotation, as discussed in our Investor Day. The adjusted EBITDA margin in North America data management declined year-over-year, primarily as a result of increases in investments associated with product development, however, remains a very healthy 52.3%. The internal storage revenue growth in Western Europe of 1.7% improved from the fourth quarter, while internal service revenue growth of 4.4% benefited from an increase in special projects in the U.K. and new customer wins in Germany and Spain. The Western Europe adjusted EBITDA margin declined year-over-year due primarily to a one-time tax benefit in the U.K. of approximately $3 million, which we discussed a year ago. In the Other International segment, which includes the larger legacy Recall Australian business, we continue to see strong storage and service internal revenue growth, and improving margins. As for Corporate and Other, adjacent business internal service revenue showed a small $600,000 decline related to lower project revenue in art storage. Moving to slides 10 and 11 quickly, consistent with the fourth quarter call, slide 10 shows the relative size of each segment and its contribution to our results through a storage and service lens. Storage continues to provide more than 80% of adjusted gross profit with the remainder from services. As you heard in our Investor Day, we continue to innovate on new service offerings for our customers, focusing on value-added services which deliver gross profit growth. Slide 11 contains the same information as slide 10, but viewed on a product line basis. Before turning to our outlook for 2017, let me quickly touch on the composition of our global business. The chart on slide 12 remains consistent with the data provided on the Q4 conference call. As you can see, roughly 60% of worldwide revenues are generated in the U.S. And importantly, approximately 70% of adjusted EBITDA is in U.S. dollars. This demonstrates that the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations are somewhat muted on adjusted EBITDA. Also, we continue to match our foreign denominated debt to create natural currency hedges to mitigate translation exposure, while also being tax efficient. At quarter-end, 23% of our debt was in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Let's turn to our guidance for 2017, summarized on page 13 of the deck. Our outlook for business trends and fundamentals remains unchanged since February on a constant dollar basis. For full year 2017, at the midpoint, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow by 17.5%, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding to around 33%, an increase of about 200 basis points compared to 2016. In addition, AFFO is expected to grow by 11.5% of the midpoint, supporting our expected dividend growth of 7% in 2018. As noted in February, our guidance assumes that we invest about $20 million in operating costs associated with innovation initiatives and global shared service programs. We continue evaluating several storage and service line innovations, and should these innovations meet or exceed specific success-based hurdles, related operating expenditures associated with commercialization of these initiatives could have a minor impact on full year adjusted EBITDA expectations. That being said, we have not made any commitments at this point and have not changed our guidance to reflect this. Turning to slide 14, our projected cash available for distribution and investments, or CAD, also remains unchanged from the Q4 earnings call. For 2017, we continue to expect CAD to cover our anticipated full-year dividend and required maintenance capital expenditures, with approximately $125 million of capital remaining to support core growth racking and other discretionary value-accreting investments, and requiring about $200 million of external funding for the remainder, excluding Recall costs. Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, we had liquidity of nearly $1 billion at quarter-end, and a lease-adjusted debt ratio of 5.8 times, which is in line with our expectations. In the short-term, we expect our leverage ratio to remain above long term targeted levels following the Recall acquisition, and then trend down as we collect divestiture proceeds, fully realize the synergies and transformation benefits, and continue internal growth. We expect our lease-adjusted debt ratio to be 5.6 times at year-end, and then trending down to 5 times in 2020, as we laid out in our Investor Day. To remain in our targeted capital structure and to take advantage of market conditions, we expect we will term out a portion of our borrowings with longer-term debt and attractive rates, thereby extending our average maturity. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and results that are consistent with expectations. We are well positioned to deliver on our financial projections for the year having started with strong internal growth momentum. As I said last week at our Investor Day, our steady growth, strong margins, and very effective field leadership will allow Iron Mountain to thrive in all business cycles. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Stuart. And before turning it over to Q&A, I'd like to just briefly summarize some of the key points. First, we continue to execute well in our plan. We are pleased with the performance across all metrics, and particularly call out our organic revenue growth because this provides the fuel in the tank for the business. And putting this all together, it furthers the durability of our business model, the cash flow and dividend growth as well allows for investment for future developments. With that, I'd like to, operator, turn it over to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. This is Michael Cho in for Andrew. I just want to touch on the services segment for a minute. I think you discussed paper prices and some project-related revenues this quarter. But just more broadly about that, I realize Iron Mountain is pressing into and introducing new services to offset previous growth headwinds, but also those new services could come with a lower gross margin profile. How should we view this quarter's results in that context, where services organic grew and margins expanded as well?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, Michael. This is Stuart. What you see, we've been through a little bit from paper pricing, but to take a step back, I mean, we've been experiencing a decrease in activity in records and tape rotation, as we've talked about. And so the team has been doing a great job talking to customers and working more on solution selling. So while the new activities that we're working on for our customers will likely be at lower gross margins than our storage business, when you look at it compared to our service business, we wouldn't expect any real degradation of gross margins from that. And again, we're focused on gross profit and solution selling. So, when you think about different activities that we've got going on out there for our customers, and they're looking for help managing things like HR records, scanning businesses so that they can monetize and take advantage of the records that we store for them, we think that there's not going to be any real degradation in the gross margin to that. And over time, the innovations that we're working on today is – a number of these, as Bill talked about earlier, are still in the garage in early days; these are things that we're going to continue to innovate on as we talk to our customers.
Michael Y. Cho - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Bill, can you discuss progress in penetrating the middle market channel in the quarter following the Recall transaction? I asked since 1Q records management volume growth, as you noted, accelerated to 1.9% from 1.7% in 4Q. How much of that acceleration represents improvement in the middle market versus other potential drivers you're seeing?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Good morning, George, and thanks for the question. It would be wrong to say that, that 0.2% uptick that you're seeing is from the middle market. That being said, you're right to say one of the areas where we're building kind of tailwinds to the business is the middle market, and we continue to be pleased in terms of the results we're getting it. I mean, in fact, actually before Investor Day, whilst I was in New York, I was calling on a financial service customer. And actually, through their independent agents, is that's another area where we're starting to look at offerings on where we can help support some of the people that support them. And that's clearly the smaller end actually, the SMB market. So, we're starting to build real momentum in that segment, but I think it would be too early to call out all the volume increase that we're seeing is coming from there.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Right. And any specific drivers you would call out in terms of the volume growth acceleration?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: A lot of it comes back to almost what Stuart was saying before, because as we're actually getting better at new service offerings in the service area, we're providing solutions, and those solutions, the exhaust from a lot of those solutions are more storage. And I think I maybe mentioned this on previous calls, is that we're actually taking a page out of our playbook that we use when we started building our services in the emerging markets because many times in the emerging markets, where the category of storing documents is not well understood, our first offering for those customers was solving a specific problem and solution, and it was a service that we provided. And part of that service is we built a further relationship with them, and built more storage on the back of it. So I think what I would say at this point is that we are getting better with our sales force in the developed markets. As in the emerging markets, we always had to kind of approach it that way by getting them much more about solution selling rather than the transaction sales, and that's having benefits, both in the service as well as on the storage.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it; that's helpful. And digging quickly into the services piece of the business, can you elaborate on your pipeline for project-based services revenues and the ability for these new services to offset declines in legacy transport?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think that we're continuing to see good progress on that, but as I said at the last call, it will be lumpy. In other words, almost by the very nature of project revenue, so it's much easier predict on an annual basis than it is on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But we're starting to build real scale in that. So obviously, even the volatility will start looking smoother and smoother as we build a bigger base of project-based revenue. But if you think about the drag of the – or the downtick in the legacy transport business as the business becomes more about proof than use, then you can see that the performance that we have – we're very pleased with the strong positive internal sales performance that we had in service this quarter. And think of it about 50/50. In other words, 50% of that was through building a lot of these new project-based service offerings, and the other half was the growth in our shred and paper business. So it is clearly having a strong impact in terms of offsetting what was our – the predominant portion of our service portfolio, which was transport in the past.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Just want to go back to the first quarter organic storage growth of 3%. And then you're still guiding to 2% to 2.5% for the year. Can you just talk about the cadence of that growth, how you expect it to progress through the year?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Karin, hi, this is Stuart. If you think about it, first of all, 2016, we really had an uptick in storage growth last year, in the second half of the year. And again, I'll point out that, that was after the Recall acquisition, so really showing that our commercial team is really staying focused on delivering. And so we anticipate that we'll be, in the second half, on a year-over-year growth basis, it will slow down because we will have tougher comps. That said, I think at this point, having what we've delivered in the first quarter, we'll be closer to the 2.5% than the 2% in the guidance.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: That's helpful. My second question is a bigger picture one. I hesitate to ask it because I know you converted to a REIT not too long ago. But in light of the Trump Administration's proposal to reduce corporate tax rates down to 15%, in that environment, would it make sense for Iron Mountain to remain a REIT?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's a good question, Karin. And rest assured, you can imagine we're watching it very closely. But I think, first, remember that we do have a very large service portfolio. So tax reform would be a real benefit for us because we pay full corporate taxes on still our service part of the business, which you can see in our structural tax rate, is not insignificant. So if we can get real tax reform, even – let's take what was proposed yesterday, but who knows what's going to finally shoot out, that would be a real benefit to us; that's kind of the first point. The second point I would just say, it is something that we're heavily engaged, both directly on our own steam as well as through NAREIT. So, for instance, I personally have been to Washington twice this year, and it's not because I like the place. But I've been down there twice since the beginning of the year with our government affairs people, as well who – and the person who leads our government affairs is a former tax attorney or is a tax attorney. So it is one of the key things that we focus on when we're on The Hill, as well as with NAREIT. And I was with a bunch of CEOs with NAREIT in late winter. And one of the things, particularly, that we are sensitive to, and it hasn't been clarified, is how the dividends that flow through the qualified REIT subsidiary, which are non-qualified dividends, how those are going to be treated under the new tax legislation, because the past, both we and NAREIT are very focused to make sure those dividends get treated at the same tax rate as the pass-through because it keeps it at a level playing field. So specifically, the one thing that did come out in the proposal that we saw yesterday is we would be continuing our lobbying efforts, both as Iron Mountain and through NAREIT, to make sure that non-qualified dividends coming through the REIT subsidiaries would be treated on the same basis as any tax rate for a pass-through.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the color.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Karin.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. This is Adam on for Shlomo. One question I had and another question's been answered. There's a comment in the presentation about several innovations that if you meet or exceed success-based hurdles, the related OpEx associated with the commercialization would impact EBITDA. Can you just explain that a little bit more? Is that kind of a recognition item in terms of operating versus capitalization, or is that kind of incremental expenditure?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Actually, it would be both. I mean, first of all, I should say if something comes – starts developing in the garage that looks promising, it's actually a good news story. But we haven't built anything in because at this point, we're still in the exploration phase. But it would be both OpEx and CapEx. But then, if you look at it in terms of the total numbers that we're guiding to, it would be noise in those numbers. So it wouldn't affect, in any significant way, either our EBITDA or our CapEx guidance at this point. But we're just calling out that it's – we haven't baked that in at this point because we don't know how things develop in the garage.
Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Everything else has been answered on my end, so thank you.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I'd just like to thank everyone for participating this morning. I know it's a busy season, and also for those of you that joined us last week at Investor Day, we hope you enjoyed as much as we did and, again, we appreciate your time. So, have a good morning or good afternoon wherever you are. Thanks.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be reporting a solid fourth quarter and full year results for 2016. Before I discuss in more detail our results, I want to point out that both the quarter and the year witnessed major progress on continuing as well as enhancing the durability of our business. This has been marked by continued strong internal volume and revenue growth before all acquisitions in our developed or mature markets. Moreover, we further extended our business model into the faster and higher growth emerging markets. Additionally, we continue to building on our brand and reputation, serving 940 of the Fortune 1000 companies through our growth and expansion in Adjacent Businesses. A major support to all three pillars of durability has been the transformative nature of the Recall acquisition where we are ahead of plan in most areas. This transformative acquisition is having a major impact on both the financial and strategic goals of our company. Turning to a more detailed overview of our progress in these areas, total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and core storage fundamentals were in line with our expectations, both on an internal and total basis. Notably, our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded more than 50 basis points, a sequential improvement over Q3, reflecting continued margin expansion as a result of Recall acquisition synergies and our Transformation Initiative, whilst integrating the historically lower margin Recall business. We also achieved storage internal revenue growth in Q4 of nearly 3%, internal volume growth was also positive in all storage segments and averaged 1.7% for the quarter. New volume from existing customers of more than 30 million cubic feet was consistent with the past few years, demonstrating the consistency of customer behavior related to storage of new regulatory and legal documents. In short, we maintained our focus even in the midst of the Recall integration related activity. Stuart will have more shortly on our updated guidance for the year, which reflects consistent performance, expectations for the core business fundamentals, continued strong growth in high-single to low-double digits on an internal basis in our Adjacent Businesses and our Other International segment, which excludes Australia, updated foreign exchange expectations, the expected impact from the reinvestment of some Transformation savings into innovation and further efficiency initiatives, and our expected cash available to support distributions and growth investment. Returning to our overall summary, slide 4 is a quick review of progress against our 2020 strategic plan during the year. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we continued to drive positive storage rental internal growth for the year with 1.9 million cubic feet of internal volume growth on a trailing 12-month basis. In terms of our progress of expanding our business model into faster growing emerging markets, we are just shy of 18% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis, a major improvement over 10% just three years ago. Year-over-year progress was also supported by our other transactions in four additional new countries. In addition, we acquired tuck-in businesses in existing markets in Western and Eastern Europe that strengthened our market positions there. In Adjacent Businesses, we achieved strong topline growth in our data center business where we continued to see attractive complementary opportunities. In October, we broke ground on our 80-acre site in Northern Virginia, which remains one of the strongest data center markets in the country. We expect to bring the first of four buildings online in the third quarter, and once fully built out, this site will more than quadruple our existing capacity. Whilst the construction is under way, we continue to see good momentum and are managing the development of new space in our underground data center in Boyers, Pennsylvania, to address both new customer demand as well as growth from existing customers. Between our Boston facility and the underground data centers in Boyers and Kansas City, we continue to see internal growth in excess of 20% in this business area, albeit off a relatively small base. We also solidified our leadership position in art storage with two tuck-ins during the year, Fairfield and Cirkers. We continue to see opportunities for consolidation in this storage market segment. Combining expansion in both Emerging Markets as well as Adjacent Businesses, we made good progress in 2016 with shifting our revenue mix in line with our 2020 plan goals as you can see on slide 5. As we noted in the past, we have an objective to reach 25% of total revenues from our higher growth portfolio. Supported by the acquisition of Recall, we are now quite close to 20% of our mix coming from these businesses. As I mentioned, our guidance includes M&A and near double-digit organic growth to support this transition, both in Emerging Markets as well as in Adjacent Businesses. As this shift progresses, we expect to see faster EBITDA growth and expansion in ROIC. Turning to progress on the benefits from Recall integration on slide 6, as we noted last quarter, we've gotten off to a great start with integrating Recall's business and implementing actions that enabled us to achieve synergies faster than our original expectations. The integration has gone well. Our cultures were similar, thus enabling us to quickly combine teams and advancing number of objectives that were key to achieving the synergies. As you can see, the financial impact is flowing through very strongly, and we are early in seeing some of the potential for further benefit in having by far the leading global platform. Our guidance assumes $80 million of net synergies to be realized in 2017, and roughly $65 million of that was included in our 2016 exit rate. Overall, when combined with the $100 million of cumulative benefits from our total $125 million Transformation Program, we expect to generate a $180 million of combined savings impact for 2017, with roughly $20 million of that to be reinvested into innovation and shared service efficiency programs. I'll have more on that shortly. Turning to Transformation on slide 7, when we started this effort in mid-2015, our three decades of acquisitions had left us with overly complex reporting structures, overlapping teams and processes and overhead costs that had ballooned to more than 28% of sales. That was four to five percentage points higher than most companies our size and breadth. So, we committed to further reduce our overhead by 2018 into transformed teams and processes to enable us to work faster and more efficiently. We've made a lot of good progress to-date entering 2017 with our overhead as a percentage of sales including Recall at just under 25%, and excluding Recall at 24%. We have plans to derive this next $25 million of Transformation benefit from moving to a new model for delivering HR, finance, and IT functions. Moving forward, each of these functions will leverage best-in-class shared service providers to scale their service to our business partners around the world. Doing so allows us to retain cash for reinvestment and dividends without compromising our goal of having global excellence or centers-of-excellence. For example, the transformation of our finance function will include implementing a single finance system across the world to improve the consistency of our reporting and processes. Similarly, the HR team's globalization effort will include implementing a standard people management system across the business. These shifts will require an investment this year that will slightly exceed the in-year benefits of our Transformation Program, which is reflected in our guidance. We expect this work to take the better part of this year with timelines varying by function and country. Stuart will have more in a few minutes on the impact of this on 2017 guidance. The pace of our progress in Integration and Transformation can be seen in the year-over-year comparisons of financial performance on slide 8. Whilst the weighted average increase in our shares outstanding for 2016 relative to 2015 is roughly 16.5%, our growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and AFFO exceed the growth in share count. Additionally, we increased our quarterly dividend per share by 13% in the fourth quarter so the majority of this improvement is going directly to shareholders without compromising future growth. Switching gears for a moment on slide 9, we've all seen the linkage between rising interest rates and REIT public market valuations. And cycles have shown in the past that rising interest rates and rising inflation often go hand in hand. Given that we are a real estate company generating the majority of our profits from rental related activity, we believe we are unique among REITs in our ability to pass through inflation in the form of upward-only CPI type escalators in our contracts. As our storage gross margins are 75%, the CPI escalators on our rental income have a positive and compound effect on margins, especially during periods of high inflation. Additionally, when we do have the opportunity to leverage inflation, it happens more quickly than for a typical REIT as we have shorter duration storage rental contracts on average of three years for large customers and one year for small customers, which allows for more timely price adjustments. Furthermore, a portion of our customers have auto renewal contracts for which we implement quarterly pricing contracts or changes on a rolling basis that are tied to CPI. And I would note that the shorter term rental contracts are balanced against our average box age of 15 years coupled with 98% customer retention. So, the average customer stays with us for 50 years, supporting durability of the rental income stream. In terms of rising interest rates, we don't generally see an impact on customer storage requirements and the net operating income we derive from storage related activities doesn't change if the market value of the underlying real estate fluctuates. Our storage internal revenue growth has less variability than the same-store NOI and other real estate sub-sectors as we demonstrated during the great financial crisis or GFC. Lastly, effective control of real estate through long term leases with multiple extension options means we aren't as impacted by fluctuations in the value of underlying real estate. Before I turn the call over to Stuart, I'd like to say a few words of how we think about investing in new products and innovation. You may have seen our news a couple weeks ago that Fidelma Russo will join us as Chief Technology Officer in mid March. We are very excited to have Fidelma coming on board from Dell EMC, where she served as Senior Vice President and General Manager for the technology company's Enterprise Storage and Software business, one of the largest units of the EMC business. This is a new position that we're creating to respond to our customers who are increasingly asking us for enhanced solutions to their needs around information storage and data extraction. In a sentence, our innovation efforts are focused on customer solutions and processes that can further strengthen our differentiation and support growth in service and storage. We have discussed some of these items previously and look forward to sharing more of these with you at Investor Day on the April 20. Fidelma will build upon the strong momentum established by our existing technology team lead by Tasos Tsolakis. I'd like to thank Tasos for all he's done for our company over the years. Tasos transformed our IT function into a strategic enabler for the business. And over the last several years, he led our business improvement initiatives, most recently being the integration of Recall and our Transformation Program. Tasos has delivered enormous value in his time here and he leaves behind a highly capable team. We thank Tasos for his contributions and we wish him continued success in his future endeavors. In summary, 2016 was a very good year with solid execution on all three pillars of our strategic plan as well as closing and successfully integrating Recall, making Iron Mountain the most global of information management companies. All of these accomplishments in the near term support increased sustainable cash flow and our ability to grow the dividend consistently, whilst continuing to de-lever, and even more importantly, longer term, they provide us with an enhanced strategic position. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be reporting on another strong quarter and the continued success of our operations team to grow our customer base and control costs. Before diving into the details, let me first quickly cover a couple of administrative items. To simplify our reporting, we have made certain terminology and definition changes. First, we are no longer using the term adjusted OIBDA and have replaced it with adjusted EBITDA. It's purely a terminology change. The measurement itself and historical numbers remain the same. EBITDA is easier for me to pronounce and simpler for new investors following the company. Second, we tweaked our future AFFO definition. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we will eliminate the deduction of discretionary growth capital, which we refer to as innovation investment as well as add back all depreciation and amortization, which will be more consistent with how other REITs treat certain non-cash adjustments. More detailed explanations of these changes are on slide 17 of this presentation. Let's now turn to results. Our 2016 performance was generally in line with expectations as a result of the tremendous effort by the organization to successfully integrate Recall while delivering on our Transformation Initiative as Bill discussed. Before diving into the details, let me walk you through the key financial results of the quarter. First, we achieved strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 2.9% excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions. This is up from 2.1% in the third quarter, reflecting solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets. Second, we very effectively enhanced our profitability. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved to 31.7% with storage and service gross margin improvement, reflecting benefits from both Transformation and Recall synergies. Third, the integration of Recall continued on track, and we entered 2017 with a $65 million annual run rate of net synergies toward our target of $80 million to be realized in the year. Now, let me quickly review our full year 2016 results compared to our guidance on slide 10. Both on a reported dollar basis and on a 2016 constant dollar basis, performance was generally within the ranges of our guidance. The 2016 constant dollar budget rate was set in January 2016 and currency changes had a minor positive benefit in our reported results compared to budgeted rates. Revenue both on a reported basis and a 2016 constant dollar basis was squarely within guidance. AFFO came at the high end of our expectations as we leveraged our scale and optimized our capital expenditures. Approximately 80% of the capital expenditure reductions were permanent as we implemented more cost effective solutions or eliminated spending, while the remainder was deferred into 2017. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted EBITDA was within our range despite the lower overall profitability of the legacy Recall business. As we mentioned on prior calls, pre-acquisition, Recall had a lower margin profile compared to Iron Mountain's base business. Going forward, we continue to believe that we can optimize the legacy Recall business and bring it in line with our profitability levels. Adjusted EPS for the full year came in slightly below our guidance range due primarily to real estate depreciation, which does not impact FFO or AFFO being non-cash. Re-negotiations of several legacy Recall leases resulted in shorter asset lives than expected. Therefore, real estate depreciation was higher than anticipated. Let's now turn to slide 11 which shows our key financial metrics. Fourth quarter top-line growth of 24.2% was driven by acquisitions and strong internal storage revenue growth, slightly offset by foreign exchange headwinds compared to a year ago. The fourth quarter total revenue growth rate was slightly lower than the third quarter, reflecting divestitures. The internal storage rental growth in the fourth quarter of 2.9% was driven primarily by net internal records management volume growth of 1.7%. Internal volume growth was positive in all of our major markets. Service revenues increased 24.8% in the fourth quarter, but declined 0.9% on an internal basis primarily due to declines in transportation and handling activities as well as Western European service projects. As we've highlighted in previous calls, service business growth rates can fluctuate as on a relatively small basis and our mix is shifting towards more project-based revenues. We continue to focus on sustaining and gradually improving gross profits as services are complementary to our core records management and data storage businesses. The growth in adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was driven by top line growth and acquisition benefits. In addition, we continued to benefit from our Transformation Initiative and Recall synergies. As a result, we've improved our adjusted EBITDA margins sequentially and year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins improved from the third quarter by 50 basis points to 31.7%. Year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 10 basis points as we effectively leveraged SG&A costs despite headwinds from Recall's lower gross profit margin. The total gross profit margin continued to trend positively from Q3 as we realized Recall synergies and optimized operations. Compared to a year ago, the fourth quarter gross margin declined due to the mix of Recall's lower margins. Recall's gross margins as we've highlighted had higher rent expense, as pre-acquisition, at least close to 90% of their facilities. However, we were able to capture overhead efficiencies to more than offset this gross margin decline resulting in the expansion of adjusted EBITDA margins. Let's turn quickly to slide 12 to cover financial performance by segment for the quarter. Before speaking to specific performance, it's important to understand the relative size of each segment and its contribution to the results. The pie chart on this slide shows the relative size of revenue to each business segment, split by storage and service. Storage provided more than 80% of our fourth quarter adjusted gross profit, while service provided less than 20%. While we continue to innovate on new service offerings for our customers, it is important to keep in mind the impact of service declines and increases. For example, North American data management service revenues are less than 4% of total revenues, so the overall North America data management business continues to be highly profitable with increasing margins. In North America records and information management or RIM, internal storage rental revenue growth continued to be strong. This performance was driven by price improvement and volume growth. The improvement we saw in the North American internal service revenue was partly driven by the on-boarding of a large retail customer in the shred business for whom we began providing ongoing destruction services in over 10,000 locations. In North America data management, we saw strong internal storage rental growth revenue of 3%, reflecting an improvement from the third quarter. However, service internal growth declined due to the ongoing reduction of tape rotation as we discussed previously. The adjusted EBITDA margin in North America DM increased over last year to 54.4%. The internal storage rental revenue growth in Western Europe has also improved from the third quarter. However, revenues were impacted by certain contract renegotiations that we mentioned on prior earnings calls. The Western European adjusted EBITDA margin declined year-over-year due to Recall's lower margin business, overhead costs which are not yet fully synergized and a reduction in service project revenue compared to a year ago. In the Other International segment, which now includes the larger legacy Recall Australian business, we continued to see strong storage and service internal revenue growth and improving margins. Before turning to our outlook for 2017, let me quickly touch on the composition of our global business. The first two pie charts on slide 13 reflect our revenue and adjusted EBITDA composition by U.S. dollar and other currencies based on fourth quarter results, which includes Recall's more global business. As you can see, roughly 60% of worldwide revenues are generated in the U.S., and importantly close to 70% of adjusted EBITDA is in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations may be more muted on adjusted EBITDA than many realize. Also, we have matched our foreign-denominated debt to create natural currency hedges to mitigate translation exposure, while also being tax efficient. As of year-end, 23% of our debt was in non-U.S. currencies. Let's turn to guidance for 2017 as summarized on page 14 of the deck. Our outlook for business trends and fundamentals remains unchanged. We expect storage rental growth of 2% to 2.5% and solid growth in our emerging markets and adjacent businesses. We refined 2017 guidance from our preliminary outlook presented in November due to negative currency impacts and finalizing our back-office shared service initiatives and innovation-related plans. Our guidance is now based on 2017 constant dollar budget rates, which reflects and holds constant January 2017 exchange rates. Next year, we plan to issue initial guidance in connection with our fourth quarter earnings call consistent with many of our peers. Our 2017 guidance also reflects the full-year impact of divestitures of legacy Iron Mountain businesses in Australia and Canada, which represent a full-year impact of approximately $47 million in revenues. Please note that 2017 guidance excludes Recall integration cost of approximately $135 million. For full-year 2017, at the midpoint, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow by 17.5% with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding about 200 basis points to around 33%. We remain confident with the Recall synergy expectations as we continue to successfully integrate the two businesses. Further, our guidance assumes we invest about $20 million in operating costs associated with innovation initiatives and global shared services programs that Bill mentioned. So not all of the savings from our Transformation program will flow through to the bottom line. These extra costs are expected to disproportionately hit the first quarter given our kickoff of the shared service programs. Please note that due to the rapid integration with Recall, it is difficult to isolate integration benefits from Transformation benefits, so we'll be reporting these benefits together through the improvement in our overall adjusted EBITDA margins. Also, I'd like to point out that we will no longer be guiding to FFO as we believe AFFO is more representative of the cash generation characteristics of our operating businesses and provides a better measure for dividend coverage. In 2017, AFFO is expected to grow by 11.5% at the midpoint compared to 2016 supporting our dividend growth. Included in AFFO is the expectation that maintenance capital expenditures and non-real estate investments will be between $150 million and $170 million. Regarding allocation of capital to real estate ownership, we plan on optimizing our real estate portfolio through capital recycling. This means funding purchases through selling buildings in non-strategic locations while cap rates are at near all-time lows, and using the proceeds to purchase properties in more strategic locations. These types of programs enable us to take advantage of market pricing opportunities, enhance our utilization, and ensure we own properties in key markets. Our strategy remains to invest where the value creation is most compelling and reflects the best use of capital which generates the highest returns. Our guidance also assumes that we invest $160 million to $180 million in business acquisitions and acquisitions of customer relationships primarily building market share as we consolidate in our emerging markets. Turning to slide 15 and our cash available for distribution and investments, or CAD; for 2017, we expect CAD to cover our anticipated full-year dividend, required capital expenditures, core growth racking, and a portion of our discretionary investments. As a result, inherent in our guidance is an assumption that we would have approximately $125 million of capital available after funding the dividend to support core growth racking and other discretionary value-creating investments, and require $200 million of external funding for the remainder excluding Recall costs. Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, we had liquidity of nearly $1 billion at year-end and a lease adjusted debt ratio of 5.7 times, which was in line with expectations. In the short-term, given the timing and proceeds of divestitures and investments related to innovation and shared services, we expect our leverage ratio to remain above long-term targeted levels and then trend down as we fully realize the synergies and Transformation benefits and continue internal growth. Overall, we are pleased with our 2016 performance and with the progress we've made integrating Recall and executing on Transformation. Looking ahead, we are confident that we are well positioned to deliver on our financial projections for the year. Our expectations are underscored by the durability of our high-margin storage rental business, and we're extending that durability through solid execution of our strategic plan, including capitalizing on value-creating growth investments and optimizing our costs and capital expenditures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks before Q&A.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Stuart. And before opening up for Q&A, I'd like to reiterate that we are pleased with our performance in what was a very eventful yet positive year for the company. We successfully integrated Recall. We achieved strong performance in the business with solid operating fundamentals, and are excited by further opportunities in both emerging markets and the adjacent business area. Our guidance for this year calls for solid gains in revenue, EBITDA, and AFFO, and that we expect will drive durable cash flow to support investment for both long-term growth as well as consistent increases in our quarterly dividend in line with our earlier expectations. We look forward to updating you on our multiyear plan at our upcoming Investor Day on April 20. With that, operator, I'd like to open up to questions please.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And your first question will be from Kevin McVeigh of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you. Great job on the quarter. Hey, the internal growth's really strong at 2.9% bringing the full-year to 2.3%. Wanted to figure out how Recall factors into that. And then I know it's not included in. When it does, is that what kind of causes the range of 2% to 2.5% for 2017 appreciating. It's up from 2.3% for 2016 overall, but is 2% to 2.5%, how do we think about that relative to the 2.9% you put up in Q4 and again really nice job there.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Kevin, and welcome back.
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. Great to be back.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So you've got it right on the head, Kevin. So, basically, just to be clear, the internal growth is calculated on excluding Recall, right.
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So it is purely internal growth. But, at the same time, it's including as the business has gone through the course of the year, it's including internal growth on the acquired portion of the Recall business. So that's why we're guiding next year for the 2%, 2.5% because the denominator will change in terms of that calculation. So you're right, it's very strong performance in the growth in the fourth quarter, but the denominator will change slightly in terms of the calculation going into 2017. So the guidance range is between 2%, 2.5%.
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. That's super helpful. And then in terms of how should we think about overall CapEx with maintenance being kind of $150 million to $170 million, as we think about the business overall, are we getting to a point where the total percentage starts to come down as you become more efficient in consolidation and things like that?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Hey, Kevin, this is Stuart.
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, Stuart.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, over time it will. We still in 2017 will have a little bit I'll call it of above-average run rate. Some of that's just due to the maintenance that we've got on some of the Recall facilities that are flowing through in 2016 and 2017 and then after that it should be trending down.
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Awesome. And thanks again, congrats.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: The next question will be from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning. It's Andrew. I think you zipped through North America RIM storage number real quick. 1.9% growth for the quarter and 1% for the year really is kind of a record level of growth for that segment. It might sound glacial, but you haven't done 1% organic in North America in RIM storage since 2012, and so just it feels like there's some momentum in that business. Do you agree with that assessment?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, look, I think – good morning, Andrew. I think it is a fair – you probably know, I'm kind of always a glass-is-half-empty person focusing on what we have to do rather than what we've done. But, no, I think the North American team has made some really good progress, both on the volume side and on the pricing side, so I think it's starting to flow through. But there's always more that we can do, but I think you're right. I think they've done a nice job. And as you know, nothing happens really fast in this business. In fairness, it's not something that they've done in the last quarter or the last year. It's something that they've been doing over the last three years.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And could you just make a quick comment about 2017 for services organic, will that be close to flat this year?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, Andrew. Yeah, that will be close to flattish. Again, you've got to remember, the service internal growth doesn't really have as big an impact as it flows through to gross profit in the bottom line, but flattish – it will be plus or minus 1% to 2%.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from George Tong of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You are achieving Recall net synergies faster than you originally expected. Can you discuss where the upside in synergies is coming from? And if you see room for your original synergy targets to go higher?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. Good morning, George. Well, first of all, I think we are getting, as you pointed out, faster and I think we talked about that on the Q3 call. I think it really comes down to, first of all, before especially being a public takeover, to take over a public company, our level of diligence before we could close the deal was limited, right. So we had to make certain assumptions and we tend to be conservative in those assumptions until we actually can open the barn door, so to speak, and see what's there. So the good news is that we have been able to execute a lot harder and lot faster in terms of getting the synergies than what we had forecasted based on really almost publicly available data or very limited diligence. So that's the good news. And it sets us up well for 2017 where our target is $80 million and we already had $65 million exit rate in 2016. In terms of getting more, we're still working through the upside. As we've always said, we do expect that there will be additional synergies coming out of this acquisition and we always consider that most likely or most probably in the real estate segment, and we're continuing to pick through that. The good news is some of that may come through quicker because of the shorter leases that we pointed out, but it still has to be a location-by-location basis. So we're not forecasting an uptick in the overall synergies at this point, but we're pleased by the progress we've made so far.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. That's helpful. You indicated plans to reinvest $20 million of your combined $180 million in Recall synergies and Transformation savings for 2017. Can you elaborate on these investments and when you might expect to see benefits?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. It's a good point. I think that any continuous improvement – think of Transformation as a continuous improvement program. It's any of those things that you would expect that you're going to reinvest when you have the right opportunities into the business. But it is fair to say that the first tranches of the Transformation program flowed straight through to the bottom line. So the two areas that we're investing: one of them think about getting the last $25 million of the Transformation benefits or the continuous improvement benefit is associated with shared services in our IT and HR and finance functions. And that's going to require some double running while we transition to new service providers in those areas and some upfront investments. So that's one part of that $20 million is that we will have some double running cost during 2017, which will effectively mean that $25 million of next tranche of Transformation benefit won't be self funding in the year, right. So that's part of it. And then the other part of it is in line with bringing Fidelma onboard to further accelerate what we've been doing over the last couple years and investing more in technology on behalf of our customers so that they can get more out of the information that we're storing for them. You'll see some of that on Investor Day, some of the investments that we're making and what we call innovation on behalf of our customers. So some of it goes into that and as Fidelma further builds on the team that we have there.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Yeah, makes sense. And lastly, your Records Management internal volume growth was relatively consistent with prior quarters in the 1.7% range, but your internal storage revenue growth accelerated to 2.9% in the quarter. Can you discuss the drivers behind that I guess particularly pricing?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think that we are making some progress. As I pretty much say on every quarter, and also kind of reiterating part of my answer to Andrew, is nothing happens quickly in this business, because the good news is it's a highly durable, stable business; the bad news is it's a highly durable, stable business. In other words, any change I make today takes some time to actually start flowing through. And, as you know, that we've been working an making sure that we're getting the right value, i.e. price for some of the services that we're working on and that's starting to show real benefits, so.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe this one is for Stuart. I'm just trying to bridge the $30 million lowering of the top end of the guidance range; this $20 million seems to be coming from increased investments, what's the other $10 million coming from and then afterwards I'd like discuss, is the increased investment a pull forward from 2018 or is this just increased investment so just less expectation for profitability because of that?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, Shlomo, I think that if you're focused on EBITDA, I think maybe the simplest way to look at it is to start with the Q4 run rate that we've got, so we start with a Q4 run rate of just under $300 million and if you annualize that, that's going to get you to almost $1.2 billion, $1.188 billion. You got to remember in Q4 also we were having increasing synergies and Transformation benefits. So not all that flows through the quarter. So you have to annualize those benefits as well. That will get you about $40 million and you're going to have organic growth goes on in the business, right, every year. It's about 2%. And so that will get you about $25 million. Then you've got some incremental synergies that we've talked about, the difference between incremental synergies to be actioned in 2017, that's about $15 million and then you've got M&A activities that we have built in the guidance, which will give you about $10 million of EBITDA in 2017. You take all that together and you get to almost $1.280 billion when you add those up. And then we talked about the $20 million that we're going to be reinvesting back into shared services and innovation, that gets you close to $1.260 billion which is close to the midpoint of the guidance of $1.265 billion, that's the easiest way to sort of walk through the change from where we're going from 2016 into 2017.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: What changed last quarter to this quarter, just is it all the $20 million, is there something else that's in there and also...
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: If you're looking at guidance in November to guidance now, it's really the $20 million and the FX rate that had a negative impact as well. Those are the two main changes.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: But hasn't there been somewhat of an offsetting impact from rising paper prices also from November?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. You could be, but we've assumed in guidance right now that the paper prices stay consistent from 2016 – right, they're volatile. So we've assumed that 2016 stays on average flat with 2016 at about $140-$145 recycled (sic) [recycled sorted office] paper pricing.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then the $20 million of costs that are coming in for this investment, is this something that is a pull forward from 2018 that you're expecting to happen in 2018 or is this just a new investment program here?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I mean, you'll start getting the return to the benefits from them really more in 2018. So you think about the back office shared services that Bill talked about. We'll have double running costs this year, so in 2018 those double running costs go away and then we start to take back office costs out. So those will continue to have benefits as well as the revenue growth that we expect and some of the other innovations will really start to benefit 2018 as well.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: What I'm getting at with this question is really, we had a certain expectation for a combination of both Transformation and Integration synergies in 2018. Is this cost investment of $20 million then increase the number that we were expecting in total because there was $125 million from Transformation, you had about $100 million from Recall Synergies, does that now go up because we have this investment program in 2017, so does the aggregate number start to go up for 2018?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It's going to be – yeah, what I'd tell you is that, and Bill sort of touched on it, we've really moved Transformation into a continuous program to really take cost out of the business, and improve capital deployment and keep growing the business. So what you'll do is, yeah, you should continue to see margin improvement in 2018 and 2019 as benefits from these in terms of, are we going to specifically call them out as Transformation benefits. I don't think we're going to sort of specify them that way.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think it's a good try, Shlomo, for us to kind of give you 2018 guidance, but we're not going to do that. I mean, I think you can take it to the bank that we're investing $20 million back into the business because we expect to get a return on that. But to give you what the exact return on that's going to be in 2018, I'm not going to tell you. I mean you know that we're going to have $25 million of more Transformation benefit, so part of that $20 million goes to making sure that we smoothly get to that last $25 million which requires double running cost to get there. But I'm not going to call out exactly what the return on investment is going to be on the innovation. But I think after the Investor Day, you'll probably have a better view of kind of the things that we're working on, but you're going to have to wait until this time next year for 2018 guidance.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, I'm not asking for 2018 guidance. I'm just asking is it costing more to get there?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: No, I think you can argue that the $25 million of Transformation, so that $25 million of Transformation benefit is, you could argue it's costing us a bit more in the sense that what we always set up the Transformation Program, as much as we possibly could, we would self fund it. In other words, the cost to get the Transformation is we would action things early enough in the year, so that by the end of the year it paid for itself and then you got the full benefit the following year. On this last $25 million, what we're saying is that we're not going to be able to do that in 2017, but the full benefit will go through. So you could argue that it's costing us more because we're not able to self fund it in the benefit that we're going to get in 2017. I think that's fair.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: In risk of over answering this question, we could have staged it out to match funds, but the right answer for the business was to do HR and IT and finance all at the same time, and since you're doing all those at the same time, you've got more cost upfront and you'll get more of the benefits later on.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then what's the total organic revenue growth implied in the guidance including services?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, if you look at the revenue mix of the 2% to 2.5% storage and the flattish of service, you'll end up plus or minus 2%, unless you have an even number in front of me, because I think of them very differently because they are such different profit margins and such different drivers of the business.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. But in terms of shifting, we're seeing this shift to more emerging markets or starting to shift to adjacencies, I'm just trying to see if we're going to get a shift overall to overall better revenue growth.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: You are seeing some of that. You're already seeing that Shlomo, because you've been watching the story a pretty long time, is you're already starting to see that shift, right, because now, where 20% of the mix now is higher growth and you're starting to see that both on the top and the bottom line starting to – what I would call wind at our backs in terms of that 2%, 2.5% of storage and overall flattening to slightly positive growth in service. So you are starting to see that kind of build in. But at this point it's more, I would say, wind at your back than a major switch that's been flipped.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Great, thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Justin Hauke of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Thank you, guys.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Justin, can you speak up a little bit because we can barely hear you.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Is that better? Can you hear me now?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Great, thanks.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, good. So I guess I just wanted to ask a little bit and kind of a two-part question on the capital budget, and maybe I'll start first with just the dividend commitment that you have. One of the things is I mean with all the restructuring, obviously your taxable income is lower than the dividend that you're paying out, so in other words you're paying more dividend than you would be required to as a REIT. And I guess the question is should we think of your dividend commitments that you've given as we kind of get past the restructuring as being more in line with that 90% of taxable income that you're required to or is it your intention to continue to over fund the dividend, if you will?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think over time you're going to continue to see us grow into the dividend, right, when we set the expectations for dividend growth out as part of our 2020 plan. That was always in anticipation of getting the synergies and Transformation benefits continuing to grow the business. And so, I think, yeah, so if you look at purely from what's required dividend for being a REIT, we're going to continue to return to shareholders more in dividends than is required, but we're going to grow into that over the next few years.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. And the only thing I'd add to that Justin is we think about dividends as capital allocation. So AFFO is really the measure that we focus on, and we try to say okay, what's the right mix between giving capital back to our shareholders through dividends versus reinvesting in the business. In the 2020 plan as a percentage of AFFO we do see ourselves trending down from say 80% down into the mid to low-70%s, and we continue to expect that that happen over time. But that's much more the – I mean, what you're saying is true and it's valid, but it's not what we're trying to solve for. So it's much more of a capital allocation decision, and if you look in the 70%s, low-80%s is that there are a number of REITs that play in that range. So it is true what you're saying, but that's not the metric that we are trying to solve for. We are much more looking at how do we take the AFFO and carve that out between giving money back to shareholders versus growing the business?
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. I mean, to paraphrase, I mean it kind of sounds like you're talking about it holistically over a multi-year period is what's forming the dividend policy as opposed to any given year's taxable income?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, exactly.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, I guess, the second question is just, this is the second time and I think it was last quarter, maybe it was the quarter before, but your maintenance CapEx needs to continue to come down, which is obviously a positive for your coverage and the ability to have more capital for the growth initiatives that you've talked about. To what extent is that now done? And is there anything that would be more properly characterized as deferred maintenance as opposed to kind of this is a structural shift in which these are not capital needs that the business actually has?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. I think the one distinction I've made is the really the real estate, the actual maintenance piece has been pretty well on track with guidance, is the non-real estate CapEx which includes things like back office IT systems at corporate and out in the field, warehouse equipment, that's where we've gone through and really sat down and said, what do we need to be investing in the business or is it better to repair than buy new as well as looking out over the next couple years in terms of system replacements, what can we not replace today and just sort of keep it going and because we're going to upgrade over the next couple of years. So we've gone through and sort of cleaned back or cut back some of the requests that have gone in that area. I think what you'll see us continue to do is on the maintenance side. Again, it'll be a little bit elevated in 2016 and 2017 because there is some deferred maintenance at Recall that we've got to do and that piece of it will trend down as a percentage of revenue or on a square foot basis.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, so the $150 million to $170 million in 2017, we should think is still a little bit elevated. It comes down a little bit more in 2018 and then it kind of grows in line with revenue?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right, great. Thank you very much guys. I appreciate it.
Operator: The next question will come from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Hi good morning. I wanted to circle back to a previous question on the organic storage revenue growth trend, so the 2016 forecast was 2.5%, you hit 2.3% last year, and now the 2017 mid point is a deceleration from there despite the fact that you've got more emerging markets in the mix today. I recognize that they are small changes, but it's meaningful given storage's outsized contribution, so just could you explain what you think is causing the deceleration there?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It goes back to my – question, so Kevin had it right. You can also say that 2.9% that we had in Q4 was also – I could show you the opposite Karin that, oh well you're really kind of trending up. I think what you're seeing where we're guiding between the 2% and 2.5% is the denominator is changing out, because don't forget, we integrated Recall. So what's happening is, is that we're getting similar or better continued growth in terms of absolute volume growth, but on a bigger base. So the 2% to 2.5% is as much – is mainly a reflection of the denominator. It's not that we're going from 2.9% in Q4 and we're saying, okay, now we're trending down between 2% and 2.5%. It's because in the course of 2016, we had the go-forward growth on a bigger base as we went through the year, although we subtracted the base, the Recall base that we did it on an internal basis. But still the overall base number hadn't been adjusted. So as we start getting into Q3 and Q4 of 2017, you'll see effectively the denominator change. So it's really the math. Not a change in the business.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: But said another way, so because it's organic growth, it's because Recall is growing slower organically than the base – than the legacy Iron Mountain business, is that right?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Well, it's a little bit slower, yeah, because don't forget we have now a bigger business in Australia and they also had a sizeable business in North America.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: And the next question will be a follow-up from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me sneak back in here. I just wanted to ask on the organic growth on storage, does it allocate any growth to Recall or is all the growth of the combined company allocated solely to Iron Mountain?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So the way it works Shlomo is we take out all the Recall base business, so if we bought – we bought Recall at the beginning of May and if we had a Recall customer that grew from May until the end of the year, the growth on that customer was part of the internal growth number, but the original volume for that customer was excluded.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So any incremental growth from Recall does count as Iron Mountain...
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: ... growth? (sic) [Internal volume growth?]
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: So when you look at the volume growth in the supplemental on slides 9 and 10, you'll see the overall trends increasing on new volume from existing customers and new sales, as well as destructions increasing as that volume comes in there, so that's the easiest place to see it.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So it's really just a math exercise over here. So going back to 2% to 2.5% is just more of a normalized thing, it is just kind of elevated because all the growth is allocated to Iron Mountain right now?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Exactly. Exactly.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And at this time, we have no additional questions. I'd like to hand the conference back to management for any closing remarks.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay, well, thank you all for your time this morning. Thank you, operator and I hope to see as many of you as possible on the April 20 in New York City. So have a good rest of reporting season.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Kwashia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q3 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Ms. Melissa Marsden, you may begin your conference.
Melissa Marsden - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Kwashia, and welcome everyone to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. This morning, we'll hear first from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic initiatives; followed by Stuart Brown, CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. As we've done for the last several quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com under Investor Relations/Financial Information. Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2016 and 2017 preliminary financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's slides, our earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. And the reconciliations to those measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be reporting a solid quarter, and I'm also happy to be partnering with Stuart Brown for his first Iron Mountain quarterly conference call. Stuart's been on board since the time we reported Q2 and has been spending a lot of time in the field, familiarizing himself with the business and working closely with Rod during the transition. Stuart will deliver financial highlights in just a bit. For the third quarter, we delivered revenue and Adjusted OIBDA results right in line with our expectations and notably drove our Adjusted OIBDA margins back to 31.2%, more in line with historical norms prior to integrating the historically lower margin Recall business. In addition, we continued to see consistent trends in our core business with positive internal storage rental revenue and volume growth in developed markets, a greater portion of our revenue coming from faster-growing emerging markets and good momentum in our adjacent business segment, particularly data center. As noted last quarter, due to our quick actions, we are getting Recall integration synergies faster than expected. In fact, we now expect to exit 2016 having achieved more than 85% of the total synergies we expected to have achieved by year end 2017. This is up from 80% in our Q2 call, and we continue to expect in-year synergies to be $80 million. It is this achievement of getting synergies faster and the added benefit from our transformation initiative, which is the fuel that allowed us to increase the dividend per share starting in Q4 by 13% from $0.485 to $0.55 per share. As you will recall, this is in line with what we laid out at our Investor Day a year ago, but we are achieving it a full quarter earlier despite closing the Recall transaction later than originally expected. Before going into Q3 performance, let me first provide a little more color on the Recall integration. As we've noted in the past, the Recall transaction benefits us in three primary ways. First, the level of synergy enables meaningful growth in AFFO and cash available for distribution, which funds increasing dividends and provides cash for continued investment in the business, all whilst over time delevering. Second, it strengthens our ability to reach the high-margin mid-market business, where Recall had a strong presence compared with Iron Mountain's enterprise focus. And third, it enhances our global footprint, particularly in emerging markets, giving us more exposure to these faster-growing and attractive markets. As noted in the past, integration efforts will increase the Recall base margin business, which has historically operated at 600 basis points to 700 basis points lower than ours in three areas: SG&A; labor; and in the longer term, real estate consolidation benefits. We also continue our detailed review of our real estate platform, as we consider further consolidation opportunities, which we believe can provide additional, benefit over time. Further, the growth in cash flow allows us to invest in new products and innovation for the benefit of our customers, innovation around areas from how we bundle services in simplified pricing, to utilizing excess building capacity for other types of storage, to leveraging our sector-leading knowledge to offer technology solutions to our customers. An example of this is our Analytics Dashboard that we recently introduced to help records and information managers demonstrate the effectiveness of their information governance program and uncover the value of their data. The Dashboard help them manage retention schedule, improve inventory tracking, identify potential risk and compliance concerns, and conduct internal and peer benchmarking of best practices. In addition to improving tools such as the Dashboard, we're also testing better and easier ways for customers to interact with us through mobile devices that enable voice recognition. When we refer to innovation, we're talking about tapping the ideas our customers and employees have for new products and solutions, vetting them and then incorporating them into our customer solutions and processes in order to further strengthen our differentiation and profitability. We have discussed some of these items previously, such as our emerging partnership with the likes of EMC/Virtustream, and now, Dell, in building air gap, which provides customers with the added cybersecurity all of us seek. It is these innovations and others, which not only provide additional value to our customers, but will also add to future earnings growth both as stand-alone products as well as further differentiating our existing offerings. We're planning to host our next Investor Day in late April 2017, at which time, we intend to share a few of these innovation ideas with you. We'll also have about a full year of Recall under our belts by that time. In addition, we continue to make progress on the dispositions required by the regulators. You may have seen that just last week we received approval from the ACCC, or the Australian regulator, for the disposition of our legacy business in Australia to Housatonic Partners, a private equity firm. This AUD $70 million transaction closed yesterday. In addition, we continue to make progress on the sale of the required assets in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. We're pleased with our progress on these dispositions, and we'll bring you updates as those transactions are approved by the regulators and closed. We now expect that total dispositions will generate approximately $185 million in gross proceeds compared with our initial estimate of $220 million. Whilst this total is a bit lighter than we originally expected, we are pleased with where we've landed and believe the transactions are consistent with our commercial goals in those markets. Let me now turn to some highlights before Stuart walks you through the details that can also be found in the bridging graph in our supplemental report. Total revenue growth in constant dollars was up more than 27% with similar growth rates in constant dollar storage rental and service revenue. Adjusted OIBDA as I mentioned at the beginning is back to nearly our high levels before the acquisition with Adjusted OIBDA margins up 150 basis points from Q2. On an internal basis, storage rental growth was 2.6%, and we continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be around 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume growth, which excludes the initial Recall volume we added when we closed the transaction was positive in all storage segments and at 1.8% for the quarter. In short, we maintained our focus even in the midst of the Recall integration related activity. Year-to-date, service revenue was basically flat over last year, reflecting the variability and timing of the projects. Based on our service project pipeline, we expect internal service revenue growth to be roughly flat for the full year. As we've talked about on previous calls, given our expected change in service mix, we continue to focus on improving service gross profit and protecting returns on invested capital rather than on service gross margins. We continue to focus on driving productivity improvement in our service business, but it's important to keep in mind that 83% of our gross profit is from storage. Whilst we continue to devote a fair amount of attention to how we can grow and enhance our service business, our service lines first and foremost, provide a strong differentiation to our core storage business. Turning to progress on our strategic plan, which entails getting the most out of our developed markets, increasing our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets, and expanding in faster-growing adjacent businesses, we continue to make progress on each of these pillars and the foundational elements that support them. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we added 3.6 million cubic feet of internal volume growth. North America RIM storage growth was 1.1%, reflecting positive volume growth. This is all before the impact of Recall and any other acquisitions during the period. In emerging markets, it is important to note that these markets are differentiated through higher levels of internal storage growth of roughly 10%. Our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale to drive these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. You may remember, we announced the beginning of this journey about three years ago, where we started at 10% of our sales coming from this fast-growing segment. By the beginning of this year, we had approached 16% of our sales coming from emerging markets. And now, with Recall's footprint, we are at 17.1% of total revenue on a 2014 constant dollar basis. Whilst we did not close any international acquisitions during the quarter, we continue to expect total M&A investment in the range of $140 million to $180 million this year, having closed on roughly $56 million year-to-date excluding Recall. More specifically, we expect four significant transactions in the emerging markets to close in Q4, which will utilize about $75 million of the remaining M&A budget. In addition to this final stage pipeline in the emerging markets, there are a number of smaller tuck-ins mainly in developed markets, which are expected to close. An example of this focus and continued execution can be readily seen in our Southeast Asian markets plus China. At the start of the year, this region represented just $14 million of annual sales. With the acquisition of Recall and upon closing the Santa Fe transaction we discussed last quarter, we'll have grown our business in this region to annualized revenue of more than $100 million, with leading positions in virtually all countries where we operate within the region. In our adjacent business segment, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. In our data center business, we announced a major lease in the quarter in our purpose-built Boston data center with SimpliVity, a leader in infrastructure enterprise IT. SimpliVity needed data center resources to support its engineering lab, and our colocation solution was the right fit from a cost, capacity, efficiency and security perspective. They noted that our 65-year track record of protecting proprietary assets gave them the confidence to trust a third party with such an expansion. In addition, a couple of weeks ago, we broke ground on construction of the first building of our 83 acre data center campus in Manassas, Virginia using a development partner for this first 150,000 square foot data center. This building will deliver superior physical security, lower power costs and a reduced tax structure compared to other national locations. In total, our Northern Virginia data center campus will support 42 megawatts of critical load spread across a planned four individual colocation facilities. This represents a four times expansion of our current capacity. The first building expected to open in summer 2017 will offer 10.5 megawatts of critical power and a flexible design that can meet the more exacting requirements of cloud service providers, federal government, system integrators, financial service firms and healthcare companies. It will also comply with federal technology and environmental regulations, enabling federal agencies and integrators to comply by stated deadlines for efficient, sustainable data centers. We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the business and are continuing to manage capacity utilization to stay ahead of demand whilst benefiting from pre-leasing activity in existing markets. Combining our Boston facility with the undergrounds of Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, our data center space is greater than 90% committed. And we are on track to achieve internal growth of 20% to 25% in this business area. Whilst we don't break out our data center business separately in our financials, we continue to achieve top line organic growth in this business. And we expect to end 2016 with an exit run rate of $25 million in sales, which compares favorably with our 2015 exit rate of $20 million. In terms of supporting foundations for the strategic plan, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative to remove $125 million in SG&A. We expect to action an additional $18 million of savings by the end of this year, bringing us to $100 million in run rate savings to be recognized in 2017. Whilst we didn't incur much in the way of additional cost in Q3, we laid the groundwork for improvements to be implemented next year focused on achieving the final $25 million of this $125 million program. Given the timing of Recall synergies, our transformation program, and positive business trends, we remain confident that we will generate cash flow in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day and updated in recent presentations. This provides the foundation for our dividend growth. Our newly declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share equates an increase of about 13%, reflecting the benefit of synergies and transformation. Our expectations continue to be – to grow the underlying business and cash flow, which will support an increase in our dividend per share by an additional 7% in 2018, and 4% annual growth thereafter in line with our strategic plan whilst also funding core growth racking, M&A and overall investments. As we progress our plan, we'll generate more cash available to support discretionary investments. So we'll borrow less to fund our growth plan and continue to delever. Our operations are underpinned by our very durable growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. We have a durable storage business that generates roughly $1.9 billion of annual storage net operating income, which exceeds that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self storage real estate sectors. Our lack of volatility through economic cycles and business durability clearly distinguishes our business. It is this durability that delivers consistent operating performance with high rates of utilization and stable pricing in both good and bad economies. Another thing that distinguishes our business is our relative insensitivity to higher interest rate compared with most REITs. First, our customers' storage needs are largely unaffected by interest rate movements. Second, our core storage NOI doesn't change with the value of the underlying real estate. Third, we incur virtually no TIs or tenant improvements, if a customer leave and we bring in a new one. Importantly, we have an operating business and we effectively control real estate through long-term leases with multiple lease extension options and direct ownership in strategic locations of about one third of our properties. In an increasing rate environment, this structure reduces our exposure to real estate value fluctuations compared with REITs that own their entire portfolios. Additionally, it should be noted that we generally enjoy higher levels of real price increases during periods with more inflation. In summary, it was a solid quarter with good execution on all three pillars of our strategic plan even in the midst of the Recall integration. We achieved solid internal and constant dollar growth, continued volume increases, and meaningful expanded OIBDA margins all of which support increased cash flow and the 13% increase in our dividend per share. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stuart.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying how excited I am to be a part of Iron Mountain and working with mountaineers around the globe. The durability of Iron Mountain's records management and related businesses and the substantial opportunity to continue to optimize performance following the Recall acquisition and through our strategic plan is just part of what drew me to Iron Mountain. I am really pleased that our strong results this quarter demonstrate our ability to execute. There are many opportunities ahead, and I believe it's a very exciting time to be a part of the team. Before diving into the details of our financials, let me take a moment and walk you through the key highlights of the quarter. First, we achieved strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 2.6%, excluding Recall and other small acquisitions. This compares with 2.1% last quarter, reflecting solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets. Making up over 80% of our gross profits growth in the storage rental business remains our key execution focus. Second, we enhanced our profitability. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved by 150 basis points from the second quarter, as benefits from the transformation program and synergies from the Recall transaction flow into our results. Third, we are making great progress on the integration of Recall and over 85% of the $115 million of 2017 growth synergies will be in process by the end of this year. Fourth, since June 30, we completed approximately $380 million of debt refinancing at attractive rates, including the recent $50 million mortgage, resulting in about 74% of our debt now being fixed after paying down the revolver in early October, and that compares to 68% in the second quarter. Our average maturity was 5.1 years and our weighted average interest rate was 5.1%. Our Canadian debt offering tied to the lowest coupon ever in the high yield Canadian market demonstrating our debt investors' appreciation of our solid cash flow and recognition that our leverage is in line with many investment grade REITs. We remained steadily on track to deliver on short term financial objectives and long-term goals. And as Bill mentioned, it is based upon this continued demonstration of growth, the durability of our cash flows and capital efficiency that our board of directors increased our dividend by 13% to $0.55 per share. Now that I've covered the highlights, I'll go over our worldwide financial results followed by a review of our performance by segment and conclude with the discussion on our outlook for 2016 and a preliminary view on 2017. Consistent with prior quarters, we provided bridging schedules for total revenue, Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted earnings per share, and FFO per share to explain key variances in our year-on-year performance. These schedules can be found on pages 23 through 26 of the supplemental. Let me walk you through the highlights. For the third quarter, our total reported revenues increased 26.3% or 27.4% on a constant dollar basis. Excluding the Recall and other smaller acquisitions, total internal revenue increased 1.4% in the third quarter compared with a 0.4% increase in Q2, again with improvement in all regions and segments. We expect total internal revenue growth in 2016 to be between 1.5% and 2%, reflecting continued solid performance in our higher margin storage activities and growth in adjacent businesses, offset by modest declines in service revenues. Let's look at storage and service revenue performance in the quarter. Storage rental revenue is the core economic driver of our business, representing 61% of revenue and 83% of our total gross profit. As I mentioned earlier, our third quarter storage internal growth accelerated to 2.6% from 2.2% growth in the first half of the year, and we continue to expect full year storage internal growth of approximately 2.5%. Service revenues which make up 39% of total revenues and 17% of our gross profit declined 0.5% from a year ago compared to a year-over-year decline of 2.1% in Q2. As we've highlighted in previous calls, the mix shift in our service business growth rates can be a bit volatile on a quarter-on-quarter basis. However, we expect internal service revenue growth to be about flat for the full year. Total third quarter gross profit margin declined slightly from Q2 due mainly to the additional month of Recall results. As we've previously highlighted, Recall pre-acquisition, operated at a lower margin than Iron Mountain due in part to having higher rent expense as a percentage of revenue, as Recall lease almost all of their facilities. However, we were able to capture overhead efficiencies and other synergies to more than offset this margin decline resulting in expansion of Adjusted OIBDA margin. In the quarter, we grew total Adjusted OIBDA by 29.1% on a reported dollar basis and by approximately 30% on a constant dollar basis. Importantly, Adjusted OIBDA margins expanded year-on-year and sequentially to 31.2% as we continue to see benefits from transformation actions and from Recall synergies. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.27; Adjusted EPS was impacted by the amortization of Recall's customer relationship values and the depreciation expense of legacy Recall racking structures. As a reminder, the amortization expense of customer relationships flows through to funds from operations. However, the increased depreciation does not because real estate depreciation is excluded from FFO. Normalized FFO per share was $0.44 for the quarter. The decline in FFO per share was driven by two factors. First, the increased non-cash amortization of Recall's customer relationship intangibles as discussed back in April, that is not added back to calculate FFO. Second, is the tax impact of Recall related expenses. As most of the costs of this integration phase were incurred in our qualified REIT subsidiary, they did not provide a tax shield. This last item also impacted our effective tax rate which appears high as the Recall costs and the $14 million impairment reduced pre-tax income, however they did not reduce taxes recorded in our taxable subsidiaries. This is a short term effect of the integration effort. Third quarter AFFO was $169 million compared with $134 million in the year ago period, fueling our dividend increase. Remember AFFO adds back non-cash items such as amortization and non-cash or discrete tax items, so AFFO was not as impacted by the same items that impacted FFO. Let's turn quickly to our financial performance by segment. Pages 15 and 16 of the supplemental outline our performance by segment in detail for the quarter, and on a year-to-date basis. Let me touch on a few highlights from these pages. In North America Records and Information Management or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 1.1%, reflecting strong internal volume growth, in North America Data Management or DM we saw a strong internal storage rental growth of 2.2% reflecting an improvement from the second quarter. However, service internal growth declined due to the timing of projects and the ongoing reduction in tape rotation as we have discussed previously. The Western European segment had 0.3% of internal storage rental growth, having been impacted by the carry forward of certain contract negotiations that we mentioned on our last earnings call. In the Other International segment, we continue to see strong storage and service internal revenue growth of 11.6% and 6.9% respectively. Let me now talk about the Recall integration progress and the costs that we have incurred so far to achieve synergies and integrate Recall with our business. Bill explained we remain on track to achieve the synergies in total, albeit we are getting there a bit faster. Our expectations of total cost to achieve synergies are still consistent with prior projections, $380 million and deal costs of $80 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur roughly $50 million in operating expenses, and $17 million in capital expenditures as we accelerate the cost savings programs. Year-to-date, Q3 we have incurred $103 million of integration in deal close costs and $7 million in capital expenditure. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q which will be filed later this week. Please note that these one-time items are excluded from our Adjusted OIBDA calculation. Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 and preliminary outlook for 2017 summarized on pages 10 and 11 of the supplemental. Our outlook for business trends and fundamentals remains unchanged with consistent storage rental growth and accelerating growth in our International and Adjacent Businesses. In addition, our expectations for Recall's contribution and our standalone business contribution remain unchanged as seen in the table at the bottom of our guidance page. Our guidance is now on a reported dollar basis given foreign-exchange differences during the year have been small and this now serves as the baseline for our 2017 outlook. Further, we have updated our 2016 FFO guidance to adjust for the increases in income tax expense, amortization and interest. Our AFFO guidance remains unchanged at $610 million to $650 million reflecting savings we have identified in maintenance capital since the Recall acquisition, as well as non-real estate capital expenditures which were partially offset by increases in interest expense and cash taxes. However, we anticipate AFFO for the full year to come in above the midpoint of our guidance. Our interest expense for the year is higher than we originally assumed due to the timing and amount of divestiture proceeds as well as additional Recall integration related spend. AFFO continues to provide ample funding for dividends and core growth racking investments. Given the higher interest in taxes than our original guidance, we expect Adjusted EPS to be near the low end of our guidance range for the year. Upon further review of Recall's real estate assets and overall systems requirements, we reduced our capital expenditure outlook, real estate and non-real estate maintenance as well as non-real estate investment by $25 million for 2016. The capital efficiency that is created by bringing the two businesses together is better than we had originally anticipated. Therefore, this is an elimination, not a deferral of spend. In addition, we reduced our real estate investments by $95 million driven mostly by delayed spending on lease conversions and certain real estate development as we make sure we take the time to optimize each market's needs and negotiate with landlords to consolidate facilities in light of the Recall transaction. Note that the reduction in real estate spend this year is not impacting our synergy or margin outlook or 2020 vision as we know that these types of investments take a period of time to stabilize. Distributions for the year will total around $500 million resulting in our dividend payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO consistent with our prior guidance under 80%, and becoming more aligned with REIT peers over time. Let's touch on our preliminary guidance for 2017 which is based on September 30 exchange rates. At a high level, this guidance is consistent with long-term expectations with slightly lower growth from acquisitions given our focus on Recall this year. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect adjusted OIBDA to grow by 17% and AFFO to grow by 12% in 2017 compared with 2016. We'll provide more detail on capital allocation and other guidance for 2017 in February after we finalize prioritizing investments. We expect maintenance capital expenditures and non-real estate investments to be approximately $170 million next year, together representing roughly 4.5% of revenue consistent with 2016. Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, we currently have liquidity of approximately $1.1 billion and a lease adjusted debt ratio of 5.7 times as expected. In the short-term, given the timing of proceeds from the divestments, we expect to end the year at a leverage ratio around 5.8 times and to trend down from there in line with our 2020 vision. Lastly, we continue to focus on strengthening our debt structure through increasing exposure to long-term notes and shifting a greater percentage of our debt to foreign jurisdictions, which creates a natural currency hedge to mitigate translation exposure while also being tax efficient. In September, we raised CAD 250 million in senior notes at 5.375% due in 2023 and closed on a AUD 250 million dollar syndicated term loan B facility which matures in September 2022 and currently bears interest at 6.05%. Overall, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and with the progress we have made integrating Recall and executing on our transformation program. Looking ahead, we are confident that we are well positioned to deliver on our short term and long term financial projections. Our expectations are underscored by the durability of our business and we are extending that durability through solid execution of our strategic plan and optimizing our costs. Before closing, I want to mention that I continue to be impressed with the caliber of the team here at Iron Mountain. And appreciate the passion that our teams in the field have to care for our customers. Their focus on moving the business forward during a major acquisition integration was evident in the performance this quarter. I continue to expand my knowledge of the Iron Mountain business and look forward to meeting with many of you in person over the coming months. With that I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you, Stuart. We are pleased with our underlying results as well as our progress with integrating Recall and at a high level we should think about it as we've issued 20% more shares to purchase Recall. In less than six months in on a Q3 to Q3 basis we have seen revenues up 26%, Adjusted OIBDA is up 29%, and AFFO is up 27%. All this has allowed us to increase our dividend per share by 13% and do this three months sooner than predicted. With that, I'd like to take questions.
Operator: And your first question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hi, thanks, good morning. Now that more of your services business is project based, can you discuss how signings look for services and whether your signings trend support positive internal services revenue growth for full year 2016 and 2017?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Good morning, George. I think as we noticed what we expect is that service revenue for 2016 to be flat based on the pipeline that we've looked at, and then for 2017, we expect – we'll give you further guidance in February, but I think you can expect a slight improvement on 2017 based on what I see in the pipeline right now. But you're right, as we now have more and more is project based is we need to take that into effect as the core services decline as the business becomes more archival. But right now, I would say 2016 is going to be flat, in 2017 we expect – we'll give you more later in February, but I would expect that it's going to be a slight improvement on 2016.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And can you, as it relates to Recall, discuss some of the early realization of the synergies you saw in the quarter, and what aspects of the transaction helped allow for this early realization of synergies, and then whether there is potential for additional upside beyond what you already see?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: That was a good try George. But I think you know what I'm going to say about the upside. Because right now we're very pleased that we're getting it faster. I think we're – we still remain optimistic that there'll be upside as when we get into the real estate consolidation, but obviously that's a longer term. I think the biggest fuel to being able to get it faster, the answer was cultural. That when – you always – when you have a competitor across you, you always tend to think they are more different than yourself, but actually when we brought the two organizations, there was a lot of common understanding and common way of doing things. And the result of that was we were able to bring the teams together much faster, because especially these early synergies are mainly head count related. So let's say we weren't – we are not going deeper than we expected in terms of the head count reductions, but the speed at which we were able to align processes and then release people was much faster than we plan. So I would say it's probably that the key driver has been cultural. But let's say in terms of further upside is we still remain focused, but we think there is going to be further upside when we start consolidating the facilities, but that's more in the midterm rather than the near term.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Another thing – this is Stuart. Another thing I'd add quickly is that just our procurement teams have done a really great job going through and comparing contracts too at the better pricing and starting to capture that upside. Everything from facilities, management cost in the third party that we used to help us with that to the paper business. So there's a number of things they are working hard on.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Very helpful. And then lastly, can you elaborate any one time items you expect to impact FFO and AFFO in 2017?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I'll let Stuart answer that. As he highlighted, is FFO looks a little bit odd right now because of some of the onetime issues in terms of bringing the two companies together and especially some of the integration costs wasn't tax deductible. But I don't know, Stuart you may want to comment in terms of how FFO gets normalized or starts running in more of a clean fashion (36:29).
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. We're starting to get more of a regular run rate, right? You'll expect on a year-over-year basis for the year you'll continue to see some amortization impact. The tax rate as well. While this year there has been some normalization items, so we brought our FFO guidance down this year. A lot of this has been due to integration costs and how those have hit. So our guidance next year for FFO in flowing all the way down has got a tax rate around 17% or 19%, so that's the only thing that will get normalized.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: And the one thing – just to add is that I'm not saying that FFO doesn't matter, but the thing that in terms of driving that cash both to invest in the business and dividend growth is obviously AFFO is the main thing because it's the more pure thing that has purely focused on cash, because as Stuart pointed out on FFO, there are some non-cash items that don't get added back to FFO where they do you get added back to AFFO. So not saying that it's not important, but the cleaner measure in terms of cash generation of the business going forward is for sure, especially the way our business operates is the AFFO metric.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you for taking my questions. Bill, what's going on with the North American Data Management Services line that was down 11.3% year-over-year last quarter, it was down 10.3%? We had a discussion about some tough comp on project related revenue. It seems to have worsened a little bit this quarter. What's the story behind that?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Good morning, Shlomo. So actually it's pretty much consistent with what we've said. I think I've always said on the calls for the last, I would say few quarters that it's really the transportation and I'd say that's generally down between high single digits, low double digits in terms of revenue. So it's continuing – we've continued to see the trend. As I said before, I think on a couple calls ago, we see a kind of a flattening out of that archival drop in transportation when we look at the paper storage business or the record storage side of the business, but in the data management, it's still a little bit lagging that transition into becoming more about backup and recovery rather than rotating the tape. So – and we still aren't declaring a bottom. So if you say going forward, I'd still expect that we're going to see transportation declines in the tape business still in the high single digit, low double digit level, so it's really – it's not the projects that are driving that. It's the transportation decline. So I mean the good news if you look at the storage, as we said that the storage, both on a revenue and a volume basis, if you look at revenue quarter-on-quarter, we're up a little over 2%. If you look at a trailing 12 months in terms of volume, we're up 2%, and to keep in mind is if we look at the margins of the business and the profitability of the business, whilst I think services is important, it's first the most important in terms of differentiating our storage product because that's where we build the reliability in and through the robustness of our transportation, but the part that's driving the cash in the business, we continue to be pleased with. But if you're asking me just specific on transportation, I have to say that I expect it to continue to decline in the high single, low double digits for a few more quarters because we still seem to be behind the transition that we've pretty much worked most of the way through on the records management side.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So I thought that that is true, but you typically get a certain amount of project related revenue and that helps offset it and you had a particularly strong project-related revenue quarter in 2Q 2015. And that's what made it tough to comp on that on 2Q 2016? Was I just misunderstanding how that was going through?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: No, no, you're right because it was kind of mid single digit decline, I think in the quarter that you're referring to, Shlomo, so you've got a very good memory. I think that specifically we do see – if you look at, especially in our film and sound, this includes our film and sound business, is we do have specific projects with some of the studios that rotate in and rotate out, and whilst it does drive the top line in terms of the revenue, again, if you come down to in terms of – if you backup and say, you see even though that we've lost that project which so you're now seeing kind of raw more the transportation decline and you see in some quarters, it hasn't affected our ability in terms of driving overall profit growth. But you're right, we do see those – and those typically, I'm not saying all, but most of those lumpy projects come in our film and sound unit.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then can you – maybe this is a question for Stuart, can you talk about the specific items that resulted in the FFO guidance, just go through them like one-by-one into it, what change from last quarter of – for 2016?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes, it's pretty simple really. So, if you look at the change in guidance which on a total dollars basis is about $80 million or at the midpoint on FFO was about $0.35, you get the biggest piece of it's tax expense and it's really about half of it, and the reason for that is that the integration costs out of Recall are really hitting in the REIT subsidiary, so you're not getting any tax benefit from those and that is different from what we had originally assumed. You've got about a third of it is coming from the amortization of customer intangibles, right, that's really came out of purchase accounting and as we finalize purchase accounting, I'll point out that that's not in cash, so that you get that added back in AFFO. So that's about a third of it. And the last piece of it is really interest expense and that's the rest of it and that's really the timing as we talked about the divestment proceeds and a little bit lower proceeds from that on a cash basis.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So is it half from the first part of the integration of Recall cost or being in the REIT as opposed to not lowering the tax rate outside of the REIT?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. Yes.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And I guess is that something that flows through in 2017 as well or is that something that we're kind of in since most of this has been actioned this year?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: It mostly will hit this year. There'll be a little bit next year. But next year we'll have it built into our – into the tax expectations in the guidance. We got that built in now, how that's going to flow through.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then the amortization of customer intangibles, hits the FFO, but not the AFFO because it gets added back. Is that the right way to understand it?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then the interest expense will hit both of them, right?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's just higher interest expense. Okay.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Why did the out-perms in other international step down, if you look at those bar charts that you give for storage, if you look at other international looks like 2Q 2016 minus 3.7, 3Q minus 4.5 what's going on over there?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think we've – if you remember, we talked about there is a specific customer that we have in Other International that was going through a specific kind of – I would say a legacy destruction project. So you see that kind of still flushing through.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Do you know when does that end, so we could start – we'd start to see the trend going the other way?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think we've been calling it out now for about three quarters, so I think we've got now one or two more quarters because it's a trailing 12 months, so you have to kind of see the 12 months. We can go back and check. But I think we've been calling it out for about three quarters, so you probably got one more quarter to kind of flush that through.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then what was the impact of the U.K. pound on the 2007 OIBDA guidance? Year-over-year....?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: You mean – You're asking the Marmite question, Shlomo?
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The what question?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: The Marmite question. I don't know if you follow in the U.K. they're talking about the price of Marmite. So, right now it hasn't had a big impact to date because it's more of a translation issue. You're right, it does show up in our numbers, but it's a translation issue only at once you get to the profit numbers. So we don't have the double whammy that some companies have where they have a manufacturing cost issue that they are selling into the U.K., and then they have the translation issue. So that being said, we are sensitive to the translation issue, but right now you don't see a major impact in the numbers. And we've built that in going into our guidance for 2017.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So is it fair to assume somewhere between 6% and 7% of revenue is U.K. pound and that just kind of drops down in the translation, either up or down depending on what's going on?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Actually not quite because when you go through the P&L, you remember when we had FX going against us for so many quarters over the past couple years, right. If you go from the top line, you start getting a dampening as you go down through the P&L, because we actually have costs in that local market that get absorbed that are also lower when you translate it. So it's a little bit less. You're right to think about it as kind of a start point, but it actually gets mitigated. I don't know Stuart if you want to talk a little bit more detail about it.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. When the Q gets published there is a line by line of all the currency changes, remember. And some of that currency change gets offset by the strengthening in Canada and some of the other currencies. So the net effect is not as big as you may think it is of that current, as it flows through the full P&L, but in the Q, we'll detail that out specifically.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi Stuart, you made a passing comment. And it was actually too quick for me, about CapEx for 2017. I think you referenced part of CapEx for 2016 and said it was about 4.5% of revenue. You said it might be the same next year. I assume you're talking about maintenance CapEx, so if you could just kind of bring us together on what you're willing to say about 2017 CapEx at this point.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. So, maintenance CapEx and non-real estate investments will be about $170 million, we've got built into guidance right now and again, we'll finalize that and update it in February if we need to. And so, total, together, is about 4.5% of revenue.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Okay. And your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittman with Robert W. Baird.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, great. So, I guess, my question, in North America, it looks like we had a little consecutive, or quarter-over-quarter acceleration in volumes, organic growth and that's all great, and you highlighted that. Could you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of some of the dynamics in the marketplace that are leading to a little bit better than last quarter's growth rates? Is it just – was it distraction maybe from integration, and now you're better integrated and can focus more? But some of your commentary around that, I think, would be helpful.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Well, I think you have to – good morning, Andy. I think that you have to kind of see the overall trend. If you go back kind of three years ago, right, I think we've been going at steady march forward. And I'm saying on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you can see some noise, like in any business, but if you think it on an annual to annual basis as we continue to march forward – and I think we're one of the largest implementers of salesforce.com. I think we've got the salesforce much more organized and aligned. We did the big organization three years ago. That's starting to bear fruit. And as you know, as being a long observer of this business, nothing happens fast, but you have to put certain foundations and building blocks. So, my – I wouldn't say it's any one thing. I think a lot of it goes back to what we did. And I wouldn't say last quarter's performance was because of noise of Recall. It's just that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, it does move around. But we're starting to see that whilst this isn't a high-growth business, there is still growth to be achieved which I know is counterintuitive, but I think this business will be running longer than the iPhone franchise, right. I mean, I know a lot of people in their stomach don't believe that, but if you look at the results, we continue to drive positive organic growth out of the business. And I think the new organization gets better and better every quarter of doing that. I'm not saying the sky's the limit, but I would continue – we continue to expect to get more out of even the developed markets on an organic basis going forward, albeit these are small incremental improvements, not large swings.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Then just – okay maybe another way to dovetail to that question is just with the integration of the two large global players, have you seen any competitive response from the competition, maybe the trends and the outlook for pricing, in particular, for national accounts? Can you talk about how those things have maybe changed since the closing of the deal?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Well, we don't think about pricing in isolation. What I do feel, I talked about it a little bit on my call – in my script, or when I was going through my remarks saying that innovation is an important part. And one of the things bringing the two organizations together, it gives us not only a larger customer base, but it gives us more capacity to innovate, and that innovation resonates with our customers. What we're finding, especially for the regulated customers that have to worry about compliance in so many different jurisdictions, the fact that we can give them better solutions around information governance is a differentiating factor. And you can say, do they pay for the product, or do they pay more for the storage? And sometimes, it's built up in the storage cost or pricing and sometimes it's built up in the product, but what we do find is that the world is getting more complex, especially for the heavily regulated industries. And bringing the two companies together does give us more economies of scale to do that kind of R&D, and that is resonating with customers. So I wouldn't – I think that's the way I think about the power of bringing the two companies together. It just gives us a deeper pool, if you will, to innovate around. And that – and so far, it's early days, but I've spent a fair amount of time in – with different customers. We had a top financial service customer forum in Louisiana in June. I just came back from one in Europe a couple weeks ago. And there's even more excitement that I'm hearing from our large customers about bringing the two companies together rather than less, because they're expecting even more in the way of innovation. The other thing I would highlight is it's early days, but I also expect we've reorganized the North American sales force again a little bit in light of bringing Recall in. They were, as I said, much better at running after the middle market, which is a higher-margin segment. And a lot of it is unvended, and we haven't been as present there as Iron Mountain, whereas Recall was more present. And so now the head of North American sales is the person from Recall, who's driving the charge, not just in terms of our traditional segment in the enterprise, but he also has two new leaders that are helping drive more penetration into the middle market, which we expect over time to start coming through. It's early days, you don't see that in the numbers today, but I would expect to see an improvement in those areas.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. I'll leave it there.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Can you give us more color on why the proceeds you're expecting to receive from your dispositions are coming in below your previous expectations? And can you tell us what – just update us on what the OIBDA multiple is that you're selling those businesses at today?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Okay. Good morning, Karin. So I think that the – when you get into the – and you can probably appreciate I'm not going to give you probably as much detail as you want because of the confidential nature when you're dealing with both commercial parties, but also the different regulating authorities. But I think it's much – there is certain science about it. I mean, we had certain requirements that we have to hit, but when you actually start negotiating with sellers, each seller -each buyer, rather, I should say, has different parameters that they're interested in. And lining that up, that makes sense for the regulator and makes sense for us commercially is something that we work through. So, I think, the – hence my comment is that we're lighter on cash that we're getting from these dispositions, but we're quite pleased in terms of where we're coming out commercially. So, I think, everybody wins on those things. So, I think, that's about all I can – I think you can probably appreciate that's all I can say given the confidential nature of these discussions. But I think it's a good platform. And you can see that in our guidance for next year. In other words, we're not taking down guidance for next year, because we ended up lighter on cash. And we still believe that we'll get to the leverage numbers that we expect.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. Is it just that the size of the businesses that you're selling is changing, or is it that the valuation is different than what you originally expected?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think I'm just going to leave it there, Karin. I mean, I think you can probably...
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: ...appreciate. But I think the best way to unpack it is if you look at the guidance we're giving for 2017 and beyond, as you say, I wouldn't even say it's noise in terms of our – you don't see a blip in terms of where we're going to end up in 2017. You definitely don't see any change in terms of where we're going to end up in 2020. So, I think, it's – these are – you think about NPV calculations, these are kind of trade-offs that you make between cash today, platforms, et cetera. So, I think, it's – we're comfortable where we came out.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. My second question is just regarding the line balance. Excuse me, it was $1.5 billion at the end of the quarter. Can you just update us where it stands today? And Stuart, I think, you mentioned plans to do more debt fixing in 2017. Can you just give us your thoughts on where you think is appropriate for the line balance to be on an ongoing basis?
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah total – I don't have the line balance with me. Total liquidity right about now is about $1.1 billion. You got to remember, we did one of the debt offerings right at the very end of the quarter, so we had the cash sitting on the balance sheet and has not paid off the credit facility. And then in addition, in October, we did the $50 million mortgage notes, so that brought down the balance as well. Sitting sort of fixed to floating, we call it, 74% today, we're continuing to sort of evaluate where we are in the cycle. I think, over time, you'll see us stay in the 70% to 80% range. My personal view would be to try to continue to push that up a little bit, given where the world is today. But we're right in the middle of what our target range is.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: But I think one thing Karin, just to keep in mind on that is we've gone from – the thing that I think is amazing in terms of the way that the debt markets have gotten the Iron Mountain story is we've gone from 68% to 74% fixed, and at the same time, we've taken our cost of debt – I mean, Stuart correct me, but I think it's down by about 80 bps or 90 bps in terms of the average cost of debt. We're now at 5.1%. And before we did this latest refinancing that fixed even more of our debt, we were at 5.8%, 5.9%. So, to me, it's an interesting reflection that the debt markets definitely get the durability of Iron Mountain's business, and they're rewarding for it. So, if you think about where we are now, it's in a – we're in a much sweeter spot. Not that we're in a bad spot before, but we're in a – even a stronger spot in terms of the debt markets than we were a few months ago.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah. I mean just compared to the end of last quarter, our average interest rate is basically flat despite fixing all that debt and terming it out, so.
Karin Ford - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the color.
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks Karin.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: ...squeezing me back in. Just I'm trying to understand the difference between the FFO guidance last quarter and this quarter. I mean, I understand you're not going to include additional interest expense of debt due to future offerings. But wasn't the accelerated customer relationship intangibles known last quarter? And also, the costs coming out in the REIT subsidiary versus non-REIT subsidiary, is that something that's truly accounting? I mean, won't you understand that, that's really coming out in the U.S. versus some of the international geographies are really coming out in the areas that you had identified from beforehand?
William Leo Meaney - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Let me answer – I'll let Stuart address in terms of the intangibles flow through, but I think just specifically your question on the tax and where that flows through, I think you can kind of appreciate, when we knew the number of heads that came up – because the diligence on a public company is different than the diligence on a private company, so we had pretty clear view, and you can see that in terms of our improvement on AFFO of where we were actually getting the restructuring savings. The issue is, and it's specifically in the U.S., right, because that's where we have the tax deductibility or non-tax deductibility, depending on if it's in the QRS or the TRS or the qualified REIT subsidiary or the non-qualified subsidiary is when we got into the U.S., a lot of the cost savings were in the part of Recall that would be in terms of the qualified REIT subsidiary. And that was where we didn't get the deductibility. It doesn't affect international, because although we do have split between qualified in non-qualified subsidiaries, you remember that internationally we get fully taxed in those local entities, because the U.S. REIT rules don't apply. It's important in terms of the way we repatriate money back into the United States for dividends, but it's not important in the local tax scheme. So, it's specifically a U.S. situation. And as we finished the restructuring, I'd say, there'll be a little bit more of that next year. And that's built into our guidance, because we now have clear view of what the restructuring is left that's in the qualified REIT subsidiary versus not, so we know where the tax deductibility is. But I think you can probably appreciate when you're buying a public company trying to have that level of detail until you actually get into the restructuring, that's where you get into the tax deductibility. But you think about it in terms of the ability, whilst cash taxes does affect AFFO as well, we're starting to actually get through those one-time restructuring charges, then we're still in line with what we think the total cost of the integration project is. But I know – Stuart, you may want to talk about the intangibles.
Stuart B. Brown - Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah – no. The customer intangibles as well that was something that was highly influx last quarter, so we were – it started to flow through in the second quarter, but we were still between that and the racking in the lives of the assets and things like that. We're still working through a lot of those valuations, so we've not fully flowed that through our forecast for the rest of the year. So, could we have forecasted better? Maybe, but it's getting updated now. The other thing I'd point out though to, as we've gone through and clean up and reconciled these things, I'm going to turn to AFFO for a second is if you go back and look at second quarter AFFO, we actually had understated that by around $10 million. That's because we had a – for Mexico REIT subsidiary, we had some onetime tax – integration cost or tax that we had to pay to restructure that entity. Those costs had actually been accrued as part of purchase accounting, never went through the P&L. Because it was a cash tax payment, it has actually gotten picked up as a reduction of the FFO last quarter, but it was one time in nature. Those are the types of things we exclude. So, if you go back and look at second quarter, AFFO was actually better and our trends, and that's one of things we talked about, AFFO guidance being above the midpoint for the year. That gives us comfort.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Andrea and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q2 Quarter's Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would like to now turn the call over to you host Ms. Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Melissa Marsden - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Andrea, and welcome everyone to our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic initiatives; followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results. We also have Stuart Brown our incoming CFO with us on the call today. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. And as we've done in the past several quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com, under Investor Relations/Financial Information. Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2016 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's supplemental, the earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently-filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in this supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are off to a very good start after our May 2 closing of the Recall acquisition. The base Iron Mountain results continue to show financial and operating performance, which is consistent with quarter one. Synergies from Recall are coming in faster than anticipated in 2016, and based on all this, we reconfirmed the full-year guidance we gave back in April. We're also pleased to welcome Stuart Brown as our new CFO. Stuart officially joined us last week, and I know he is looking forward to getting more engaged in the business and meeting with our investors and analysts. Stuart has a unique blend of both global operating company and REIT experience, and I know he will be a great fit with our executive team. And whilst we are sad that Rod will be leaving us, he will be around for a few months yet to ensure a smooth transition to Stuart. Turning now to our progress on Recall's benefits and integration. First, just to summarize, overall the acquisition makes us the only global platform in our industry as we continue to expand our ability to meet customers' information management and storage needs as they face increasing regulation, ongoing cyber security threats and seek to turn information into business value. As we've noted in the past, this transaction has three core benefits. First, it enhances our global footprint, particularly in emerging markets. Second, it strengthens our ability to reach mid-market businesses where Recall was very present and Iron Mountain was significantly underrepresented in this very large and high-margin segment. And third, the level of synergy enables significant growth in AFFO and cash available for distribution. This rapid and large expansion of cash flow allows us to simultaneously invest in new product and innovation for the benefit of our customers, significantly grow our dividend, while simultaneously de-levering and markedly bringing down our payout ratio. Finally, this acquisition further supports the trust our customers have in Iron Mountain to serve both their current and future needs. Trust in Iron Mountain to protect what matters most, trust that Iron Mountain will be available to continue to support them in 50-years' time, and trust in Iron Mountain to continue to use its scale for innovation and to provide expertise, products and services designed to get the most out of their overall storage and information assets. In the customer interactions we have had since closing the acquisition, their commentary has been very positive as they can see how we both have the intention and the resources to be even more innovative. An example of our product innovation was reported in a recent Bloomberg profile, highlighting the work we are doing on behalf of MTV as they celebrate their 35th anniversary. On a more operational note, I'm pleased with the team's work to welcome new customers and begin integrating operations. During the second quarter, we accomplished a number of critical integration-related initiatives, whilst continuing to pursue our transformation agenda. And we delivered internal storage rental revenue and volume growth in the base Iron Mountain business, consistent with the growth we saw in the first quarter of this year. In short, we kept our eye on the ball despite all the activities surrounding the Recall close. More specifically, since the closing on May 2, our integration progress includes several key initiatives. We completed our review of Recall's leadership and immediately brought the management teams together, enhancing our organization through the retention of key former executives to lead areas such as customer experience, mid-market and SMB sales, as well as key finance roles in a number of country and territory management positions. We converted Recall's operations in four countries into our REIT structure. We completed the disposition of Recall's business in 23 U.S. markets as required by the United States Department of Justice. We received final clearance from the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority. We solicited and are currently evaluating bids on required dispositions in additional jurisdictions. We began a portfolio review of both companies' service offerings to determine optimal platforms for ensuring continued superior customer service. And we undertook real estate reviews in select markets and identified initial consolidation opportunities in France, Spain, the United Kingdom and Australia, as well as in the United States. As a result of these and other quick actions and outstanding facilitation from the transitioning Recall teams, we're getting the synergies faster than expected. This means more impact this year. In fact, we will exit 2016 having achieved more than 80% of the total synergies we expected to have achieved by year-end 2017. We appreciate that given the closing of Recall a month into the quarter, our second-quarter results don't fully reflect Recall's contribution. And as we noted on last quarter's call, Q2 margins would reflect that Recall's core EBITDAR margins are lower than ours. In fact, Recall's EBITDAR margins have consistently been more than 700 basis points lower than ours. But we saw a bit more impact from that initially given that the assets to be divested and those already sold are among the higher-margin markets in their portfolio. You will recall the execution of our integration program increases the Recall base margin business by pulling two levers. First, in the near-term, we're achieving synergies in SG&A and labor costs. And second, in the medium-term, we'll improve our operating leverage as we consolidate facilities. Rod will have more detail shortly and walk you through the build-up to our full-year expectations. In brief, when we prorate year-to-date results, add in accelerated synergies, second half transformation benefit and typical ramp we see in the business throughout the year, we are comfortable slightly raising the bottom end of our guidance range relative to what we provided back in April. Now turning to some of the quarter's results at a high level before Rod walks you through the ins and outs that can also be found in the bridging graphs in our supplemental report. Total revenue growth in constant dollars was 19%, with similar growth rates in constant dollar storage, rental and service revenue. On an internal basis, storage growth was 2.1% and in line with levels achieved in Q4 and Q1. We continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be around 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume or prior to acquisitions was positive in all segments and consistent with recent quarters' performance at 1.7% worldwide growth. Service revenue was flat over last year, reflecting the variability and timing of projects. However, based on our service project pipeline, we continue to expect positive internal service revenue, as well as service gross profit growth for the full year. As mentioned previously, given our expected service mix, we will maintain our focus on increasing service gross profit rather than purely gross margins. Our new service offerings are sometimes lower margin, but generate attractive returns due to the minimal capital investment required. Consistent with this focus, you will note service gross profit was up more than 18% in the second quarter, exceeding the growth in constant dollar service revenue. Turning to progress on our strategic plan: during the quarter, we continued to advance each of the three pillars of the plan, as well as the foundational elements that support it. I will quickly highlight progress in each of the three pillars, namely, getting the most out of our developed markets, increasing our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets, and expansion in faster-growing adjacent businesses. In developed markets, which includes both North America RIM and our Western European segment, we had 3 million cubic feet of internal volume growth during the quarter. In emerging markets, our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale driving these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. Recall's footprint in emerging markets supports that objective and has helped drive our emerging market business to 16.4% of total revenue on a constant-dollar basis as of the end of Q2. Additionally, as our visibility on closing of Recall transaction became clearer, we resumed acquisition activity and moved into new emerging markets during the year. Earlier this week, we announced plans to acquire the Information Management operations of Santa Fe Group in 10 countries, mainly in Southeast Asia for approximately €27 million. The deal also marks our entry into four new emerging markets, Macau, the Philippines, Indonesia and South Korea, as well as further bolstering our already strong positions in Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Taiwan and Malaysia, providing a great foundation for further expansion in this dynamic and higher-growth region. We continue to nurture a deep, diverse pipeline of accretive M&A opportunities in emerging markets where we can leverage our global footprint and deep customer relationships to capture the initial wave of records management outsourcing that is in the early days within these faster-growing markets. Before turning away from our international operations, I should comment on Brexit. Importantly, we don't expect to see a significant impact. We have built scenarios related to the potential implications of the decision with particular focus on our customers, our supply base, our staff and the regulatory and fiscal frameworks in which we operate. We will continue to monitor developments closely and watch for any shifting legal obligations governing the management of information, but as other multinationals have acknowledged, it will be some time before any meaningful movement toward an exit from the EU gets underway. In terms of our core business, it is unlikely to have much impact from a constant-currency perspective, we're generally naturally hedged. As for adjacent businesses, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020 up from just 2% at the end of 2015. In our data center business, we had several recent big wins, bringing us to 80% committed in our first phase building in our aboveground facility in Boston. Combining our Boston facility with the undergrounds in Boyers, Pennsylvania and Kansas City, Missouri, our data center space is greater than 90% committed and we are on track to achieve internal growth approaching 20% in this business area. In our Art Storage business, we are making good progress and acquired another small business, a good example of what we believe will be a long-term consolidation play. Overall, between the progress we're making in emerging markets, as well as adjacent businesses, we are well on track to achieve our combined goal of having the expansion of our emerging market presence and adjacent businesses yield 25% of our total revenue mix by 2020, which is up from about 17.5% of our total business mix today. In terms of supporting foundations for the plan, we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative to remove $125 million in SG&A. Also as previously disclosed, the remaining $25 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017 and the full amount for the transformation program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. Given the timing of Recall synergies, our transformation program and expected ramp in the business, we remain confident that cash flow will be in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day, and again on our April 1 call, which provides the foundation for our expected dividend growth. As a reminder, we expect to grow dividend per share by about 13% in 2017, as the synergies and transformation benefits flow through our results, and by an additional 7% in 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, whilst also funding core growth racking, M&A and overall investments in support of our previously-presented 2020 plan. As we progress this plan, we'll have more cash available to support discretionary investment, which means we'll borrow less to fund our growth plan and continue to de-lever. And at the same time, we'll reduce our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO. Our operations are underpinned by our very durable, growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. In addition, we're extending that durability through solid execution of our plan in developed markets, identifying capturing opportunities in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses and continuing to enhance our cost structure in both service and overhead. Our durable storage business generates roughly $1.9 billion of annual storage net operating income, which exceeds that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability, and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in both good and bad times. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. I'll begin today with a high-level overview of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, which included a two-month benefit from the Recall acquisition compared to the prior year. In addition, I will review our results by segment, provide an update on our transformation initiative and summarize our successful bridge loan refinancing. Lastly, I will touch on the strong progress we're making integrating Recall into our business, as well as our outlook for 2016, which remains essentially unchanged since April. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Consistent with prior quarters, we've provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings-per-share, and FFO per share to explain key variances in our year-on-year performance. These schedules can be found on pages 21 through 24 of the supplemental. Let me briefly walk you through the highlights. For the second quarter, total reported revenues were $884 million compared with $760 million in 2015. Excluding the year-over-year negative FX impact of approximately 2% or roughly $17 million, on a constant-dollar basis, revenues grew by 18.6%. For the first half of the year, reported revenues were $1.63 billion compared with $1.51 billion in 2015. Excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions, total internal storage rental revenue was up 2.1% for Q2, consistent with the growth we saw in Q1. In contrast, internal service revenue was down 2.1% compared with growth of 1.6% we saw in Q1. As we noted on our last call, service revenues are more project-based, which have more volatile growth rates on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Based on a review of our service deal pipeline, we continue to expect internal service revenue growth to be positive for the full year. Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $261 million compared with $223 million in 2015. We grew adjusted OIBDA by 17.1% on a reported-dollar basis and by 18.8% on a constant-dollar basis. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA grew by 9.3% reported dollar, and by 11.6% on a constant-dollar basis. As we noted on our Q1 call, Recall is a lower-margin business than Iron Mountain, therefore, as expected, our adjusted OIBDA margins were lower relative to the first quarter of the year. This impact flows through to our adjusted EPS, FFO per share and AFFO results. As synergies build in future quarters, this picture will be reversed. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.24 compared with $0.28 in 2015. Year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.55 compared with $0.60 in 2015. In the second quarter, adjusted EPS was impacted by the amortization of Recall's customer relationship values and the increased depreciation expense of Recall's legacy racking structures. The amortization expense of customer relationships flows through to FFO per share; however, the increased depreciation does not because real estate depreciation is excluded from FFO per share. FFO per share was $0.47 for the quarter compared with $0.49 in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, FFO per share was $0.98 compared with $0.99 in the year-ago period. AFFO was $159 million compared with $131 million in the year-ago period. Importantly, AFFO was not impacted by the increased depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter, as these are non-cash items and do not impact our AFFO or cash available for distribution. Year-to-date, AFFO was $301 million compared with $259 million in 2015. AFFO for the year-to-date is at the high end of our expectations. However, we expect to remain within our ranges for the full year. Similar to prior quarters, on page 20 of the supplemental, we are providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations as presented in our GAAP cash flow statement. So you can more readily see the cash items that are not typically of a recurring nature. Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 17.2% compared with 13.9% in the prior year. Expected year-over-year increase in our structural tax rates was mostly driven by the legacy Recall business, which has higher exposure to international markets with their respective foreign tax rates, and which do not have the same tax efficiency as we do in the U.S. with the REIT structure. Also, the tax rate this quarter is below the previously-communicated run rate expectation of 20%, as our pre-tax income was impacted by Recall integration and deal costs. For the remainder of 2016, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 18%, as a result of these Recall costs. However, beyond 2016, we expect the tax rate to be closer to 19% to 20%. Let's turn to our financial performance by segments, in North American Records and Information Management or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 0.7% for the second quarter. North American RIM internal service revenue declined by 1.2%. Growth in shredding and scanning was offset by declines in core transportation. North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.3% for the second quarter. Internal service revenue in DM declined, as we continue to see reductions in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity, partially offset by strong growth in new Data Management offerings. In addition, we had a large project which benefited the prior-year period. After normalizing for this, DM service revenues performed in line with prior quarters. DM adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year due to a decrease in overhead costs as we continue to realize transformation benefits. The Western Europe segment generated 0.1% internal storage rental growth and internal service revenue declined by 4.6%, primarily as a result of lower activity in transportation-related revenue and lower project revenue. The low internal storage growth in Western Europe was due to a large customer win in the year-ago period and certain contract renegotiations that occurred this quarter. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year in Western Europe due to lower G&A expenses. The Other International segments, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Internal storage rental growth was 8.6% and internal service growth was 5.3% for the quarter. Other International adjusted OIBDA margins were 25% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. We're pleased with the progress we've made with our transformation initiative. During the second quarter, we did not incur significant costs related to transformation, as the focus was not head count related; rather it was on streamlining business processes. Year-to-date, we've actioned $28 million of the $50 million exit rate savings and have line-of-sight on incremental $22 million to be implemented by the end of this year. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid out at our Investor Day in October, with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. Let me now talk about the Recall integration progress and provide details on the costs we've incurred so far in 2016 to achieve synergies and integrate Recall within our business. As Bill explained, the synergy program is ahead of schedule. As you can see on the supplemental on page 25, we expect to exit this year having already achieved more than 80% of the total synergies originally anticipated for 2017. Our expectations of total cost to achieve the target synergies are still consistent with prior projections. Because we're accelerating synergies to set us up for a strong run rate for 2017, we expect to incur roughly $10 million more in costs in 2016 than originally contemplated. Year-to-date, we've incurred $37 million of integration costs, $32 million of deal close costs. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Please note, these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation as they are one time in nature. Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on page 12 of the supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent, given the durability of our business. We remain on track to achieve our short and long-term financial objectives. Please note that although our guidance assumes divestitures would occur on day one, the benefit from businesses yet to be divested that are running through our operating results is not significant. Some legacy Recall assets were sold to Access nearly at the same time as the close, so they are not reflected in our results. The remaining legacy Recall assets to be sold are included in discontinued operations, therefore not flowing through our operating income. Lastly, the remaining Iron Mountain assets to be disposed of are flowing through our financials; however, with an immaterial benefit for the quarter and full year. Overall, our core Iron Mountain business is performing to plan. Recall contribution is tracking in line with our previous expectations, and we have accelerated the realization of net synergies for the year, which is why we brought up the lower end of our adjusted OIBDA guidance by $5 million. Let me now refer you to the table at the bottom of our guidance page, on page 12 of the supplemental, to follow our expectations for full-year adjusted OIBDA. We thought it'd be helpful to cover how results track against our original expectations. But please note, we will be not reporting actual results separately, given our financial statements are now fully integrated. Our standalone expectation for Iron Mountain's core business remains $950 million to $970 million, consistent with what we previously communicated. And our performance in the first half of year is tracking right in line with our expectation. For the second quarter, excluding Recall's base and synergies less divestitures, Iron Mountain's standalone adjusted OIBDA was in line with Q1 results at $235 million. So year-to-date, Iron Mountain standalone adjusted OIBDA was roughly $470 million. In the second half of the year, we expect to realize $7 million to $10 million of transformation benefits to offset costs associated with that program in the first half. We also expect a ramp in the business as our storage base continues to expand. This ramp is consistent with 2015, during which second half-year results were $10 million higher than the first half on a reported-dollar basis. If you annualize the first half actual run rate, our transformation benefits and a similar ramp to last year, standalone expectations are in line. Now let me address the second line related to Recall's contribution for the year. Prior to divestitures, we expect the Recall business to contribute $115 million of adjusted OIBDA at the midpoint. This reflects eight months of Recall contribution, and our range implies $13 million to $15 million per month of contribution prior to synergies and divestitures. Lastly, we are expecting $18 million of adjusted OIBDA synergies, net of the impact of the divestitures for the year. As Bill noted, this is up from our initial expectation of $15 million. As a result, our adjusted OIBDA guidance range for 2016 is now $1.075 billion to $1.110 billion. For adjusted EPS, our guidance remains unchanged, although our expectations for the structural tax rate are lower than previously anticipated. This benefit will likely be offset by the accelerated depreciation of Recall racking structures. Although our total normalized dollar AFFO guidance remains the same, we changed our FFO per share guidance to reflect where we expect the final weighted average share count will settle for the year. We did not update adjusted EPS for this impact because the benefit is offset by the incremental real estate depreciation expense mentioned earlier. Please also note that on a constant dollar, guidance remains close to reported dollars. Assuming current rates hold, we do not see a downside from FX in our guidance. Moving to our expected cash available for distributions and investment for 2016, we continue to estimate that it'll be roughly $600 million. This provides ample funding for dividends and core growth racking investments. Our capital deployment plans for 2016 are unchanged. We continue to expect capital expenditures, which include real estate and non-real estate maintenance and non-real estate investment to be in line with the figures we provided on our last earnings call, and to total $170 million for the year. Our expectation for total real estate investment spend remains $320 million. This includes $70 million in core growth racking investment and the remainder of our real estate spend is expected to be in real estate consolidation, development, data center and some lease conversions. As we've said in the past, we are focused on consolidating facilities, particularly given the Recall transaction. We expect real estate consolidation will provide upsides to synergies in the long-term, but it's too early for us to quantify the exact benefit at this time. For M&A, we continue to expect to spend roughly $150 million, with approximately $100 in emerging markets, $50 million in developed markets. Dividend expectations remain consistent with our previous guidance for 2016. Our dividend per share is expected to grow from $1.94 this year to a minimum of $2.20 in 2017 and $2.35 in 2018, as we realize the majority of benefits, transformation savings and Recall synergies. Beyond 2018, we expect to grow dividend per share at roughly 4% per year. Importantly, our dividend payout ratio as a percent of AFFO is in line with prior expectations and should reduce to 70% by 2020, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. In addition, we're targeting a leverage ratio of 5.0 times by 2020. Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, at the quarter end, we had liquidity of approximately $580 million and our lease-adjusted debt ratio was slightly up at 5.8 times as expected. Our leverage ratio increased primarily as a result of the timing of Recall integration and deal costs discussed earlier. We expect to end the year at a leverage ratio at 5.7 times as we start realizing synergies and transformation savings. As many of you may already know, we refinanced the $850 million bridge facility associated with Recall transaction, primarily with long term debt. We raised $750 million in aggregate principal amount and senior unsecured notes, which included $500 million at 4-3/8% due in 2021 and $250 million at 5-3/8% due in 2026. Our unsecured debt was prices at spreads similar to business services issues rated two notches higher than Iron Mountain, and at the top of the spread range for our investment grade issuers, which reflect debt investors' favorable view of our predictable cash flow. In addition, we also amended our credit agreement and extended its maturity to 2019. So overall, we are pleased with the performance we saw in the second quarter and year-to-date. Our results are driven by the durability of our business and execution of our long-term plan. We're excited with the progress we've made so far in integrating Recall, and pleased that we will be realizing synergies earlier-than-expected. Looking ahead, we're confident that we're well-positioned to deliver on our long-term goals. We remain highly focused on extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth in cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. I'll now hand the call back to Bill.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Rod. To wrap up before going to Q&A, just to summarize, we're off to a very successful start after closing Recall and having accomplished what we set out to do in the first three months since closing. We made great progress on integrating Recall's people, platform and portfolio. We're on track with our financial expectations for the year, and in fact, slightly raised the lower end of our range for the full-year guidance. And additionally, we like what we see as we look at our exit rate from 2016 and our entry into 2017. Overall, we are excited about the potential we see to realize the benefits of combined scale with Recall and look forward to updating you on continued progress next quarter. Before I turn it over to questions, I should say that I think our transformation program probably has reduced the caffeine in my coffee in the morning. So I did, I think, misstate that Access – we sold 23 U.S. markets to Access, I meant to say 13. So, 13 is much better than 23 and I will talk to the transformation folks to kind of put the caffeine back in my coffee. But any way, with that, operator, I'd like to turn it over to Q&A. Thank you.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, It's Shlomo Rosenbaum over here prior to the name change I guess.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Shlomo, I was wondering who is at Stifel's these days.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: A couple things I want to ask. One of them is around the – what looks like the destructions and the out-perms. If you look particularly at the out-perms in Western Europe International, it looks like in the last couple of quarters you are seeing some acceleration over there in terms of volumes. Can you give us some color on what exactly is going on there?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, sure. Sure, Shlomo. So first of all, let's look at the absolute net volume, right? So if you look at Q2 2016 this quarter, you'll see that out-perms and destructions, if you subtract that from new sales and organic growth, you have a net before acquisitions of 3.8% (sic) [3.7%] growth versus a Q1 of 3% growth, so the net growth has actually increased. But coming to specifically your question about what's going on with out-perms is, the 2.3% in Q1 of 2016 is not out of norm. So if you kind of go back and you look at the supplemental on page 11, you'll see that over the last 12 month – or less, say, even more than 1.5 years or so, you'll see going back into Q3 of 2014, it goes somewhere between 2.1% and 2.3%. Where you really see the spike is in the Q2 2016 number, where you see that go up to 2.6%, so it's really a Q2 issue. But as I say, the net volume is positive. And for those that followed Recall, there was a program that Doug would euphemistically call Close the Gap. And the two things he referred to was the 700-or-so basis points lower gross margin that their business yielded in terms of their overall business. And the other thing is, he highlighted that the level of out-perms that they had relative to ours. So, where we see the roughly the 30 bp increase in out-perms from Q1 to Q2, that's driven by Recall's – emerging Recall's business into ours, which we knew was a – had a less – had a higher volatility or a higher turn in that. But you'll see that come down over time because obviously, we're wrapping the same customer loyalty program, which I think we've spoken on previous calls where we have – we built a – with outside help, we built an algorithm that helps predict 6 months to 12 months ahead of time certain customer issues that prevent the out-perms.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, they had a higher out-perm. Was it the nature of their business? Or based on what you are describing, it sounds like they didn't have as effective a customer outreach as what Iron Mountain core had. Is that the way to think about it?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, it's the latter. So and Doug used to comment on his calls, I guess, they only did half year results. But it's exactly that they didn't have the same tools. And in fact, three years ago, we basically introduced the tools – I can't take credit for it, they started the work before I came in, but we started ramping up just as I came in. And you would've seen the same decrease in Iron Mountain's business. And one of the things that Recall had is, they couldn't afford to take the investment that we did. I mean, we brought in some outside help and advisers that know how to build these tools, and it looks at a number of different things. It looks at volume through the call center. It looks at number of boxes coming in. It looks at the types of complaints that we're getting from a customer, and there's a number of different things that you pick up. The last time we gave them a price increase. And you look at those different pieces of data, and it's pretty accurate in terms of predicting when you're heading for a crisis with that customer and then you can intervene. And I forget exactly what their number was, but it was significantly – it was at least a full point higher than ours in terms of the out-perms. And you're seeing that averaging in when we go from the 2.3% to 2.6%. So it is something – it isn't structural in the Recall business. It was much more they just didn't have the same tools and sophistication that we introduced, say, three years ago.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Bill, did you have a chance to go back, now that you own the company, and a look at how many of the out-perms that they were experiencing actually were incoming to you guys and kind of do an analysis on that?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: A great question and I wish I could've gotten the DOJ – the DOJ asked the same question. I wish I could have gotten them to be data-driven. Actually, the loss ratio between – the win and loss ratio between us and them was actually much smaller than you would think, right? I mean, we'd like to say we competed against each other and we did. But actually, generally, they lost to somebody else, and we lost to somebody else. And that – I think we've talked about it previously where they have – they did – they have taken business from us. There was no question about that. But where they were much more present was in that middle market and SMB space, so they were winning and losing against much more the smaller players. And we're actually quite excited about it, to be honest with you. So their head of sales for North America now runs our whole mid-market SMB segment. And that business is, I think, approaching almost $800 million. I think $750 million of sales, if we combine the two companies. So, it's of the same size of what Recall was globally just in North America, and we think we can to a better job. So, they were losing typically to other people, and we were losing to other people for the most part.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Hi, thanks, good morning. You're substantially pulling forward Recall synergies, about 80% of total synergies previously expected by the end of 2017. That said, OIBDA guidance for the full year is not meaningfully increasing. Can you discuss what incremental headwinds you expect in the back half that are reflected in guidance?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's a good question, George, but it's more the math. So the part – it's not as big a delta as you think because you have to look at what the translation of the $15 million, because of the way the synergies flow in during the course of the year, what we get for impact in 2016 leads you to a very high – which is small, leads you to a very high exit. So, I'm trying to remember the number, but I'll ask Rod to comment. I think we were before the $15 million translated into around $60 million, $65 million. And the $18.5 million translates into around $80 million. But it's not a – it's 80% – we were always going to achieve a very high percentage; just we weren't going to achieve 80% before in terms of going into 2017.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes, George, our exit rate is 80% of next year as opposed to the in-year being 80% of 2017. So in-year, we're sort of net $3 million higher, but actually that translates into quite a significant improvement in the exit rate that we have for next year and sets us up really nicely for 2017. So it's not that the number's gone up and we're using that to cover for other things. That's not the case at all.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, it's just we're getting it faster. It's just – it is a speed, but it gives you an idea that when we get into 2017, we're cracking the back of it. We're always going to crack the back of it in 2016. We are even cracking a bigger part of it in 2016 than we originally thought.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Can you remind us what the 80% previously was in terms of exit rate?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, it was around 70%, right? I think, it was about 70% – we'll give you the exact number. I think it was about 70% because it was 60% on 90%, right? So I think it was about 70%.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It was of that order, George, 65% to 70%.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Can you provide some additional details around how records management volumes performed in Recall's business compared to recent historical trends and expectations?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Say it one more time.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Basically, how Recall's volumes performed relative to your expectations and relative to their...
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, all right. Yes. Okay, so in terms of their historical trend, so pretty much as we expected, other than – we expected, as I answered to Shlomo, we expected that the out-perms would be higher and that pretty much translated straight across because we could see that in the results. The growth and opportunity we see in the middle market is pretty much what we expected. I think that the – so the trends of merging their business into ours, we're pretty much on track. The margin that both I commented on and Rod commented on, we commented on last quarter before we closed. We knew that, that was the case. I think the one thing that has been the – so it's been more of an upside, and I think the upside has been more around the people. Not that we expected to get bad people. But I think when you buy a competitor, you always kind of think that they're different than you, and when you're talking to customers, you typically demonize the competitor. And guess what? They have blood flowing through their veins just like us, and we've gotten some really good people as a result of it. And they had almost identical values and code of conduct as we had. In fact, you lay the two slides up next to each other, we did it at a town hall, and they're virtually almost the same. So I don't know who copied from who? So we've actually, probably, if anything, have integrated the people much quicker. And when I say integrated, not just get them into slots, but people feel like they've been around a lot longer than they have, if you know what I mean. In other words, they didn't spend a lot of time trying to figure stuff out or adapt to a new culture. So that part has been better than we thought. But in terms of the way the numbers have flowed in, we haven't found any surprises.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Got it, helpful. And then, lastly, could you provide an update on services trends, if you're seeing continued signs of stability or any potential risks to growth ahead?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, it's a good question. So I think we also pretty – kind of foreshadowed at the last quarter that we thought we would see a drop in service revenue, that the next – Q2 wouldn't be as strong as Q1. And so obviously, we could see the pipeline, and we knew how that worked. The one thing that I think again we commented last time is that as we shift more to project-based rather than transportation-based service revenue, we do expect it to be pipeline-dependent and, therefore, more project-dependent and, therefore, more lumpy. So it's much easier to predict that if you look over a 12-month period than if you look at it on a 1-month or even a 3-month period. So if we – as that as a backdrop, if we look forward to the rest of the year, we like the pipeline, the booking pipeline – the bookings and the pipeline that we see for the rest of the year. So we're very confident that for the total year, we will see positive service revenue growth, which obviously means that the new services are offsetting the declines that we talked about in the transportation, which has driven to the structural shift in the way that the information is being used. So we feel very good that for the full year, you'll see a trend that's consistent with Q1 as the pipeline turns into bookings and turns into projects that we see in front of us.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. If it's okay I'm going to dive back into tapes – North American tapes decline. I just don't quite get how the minus 13.5% organic services decline in North American tapes has to do with a large project from a year ago. The decline in that business is 7 points worse than the first quarter decline, but the comp year-over-year is only 4 points, let's call it, less easy. And so, when I kind of see this 13.5% decline versus a year ago, minus 1.7%, it just doesn't seem like the year-over-year comparison explains it all.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, it's a good question, Andrew. So first of all, our – so that business also includes film and sound, right, which is very project-dependent. So a year ago, we had a very large project with one of our film and sound customers, and that project fell off. So if you normalize for that, what you see is roughly the 9% to 10% reduction in transportation that we've been calling out quarter-by-quarter. And the new services have been offsetting that between 40% and 50% of that decline. So the net decline and you'll see that going forward as well is that the net decline as the new services replace some of the transportation as the tapes are becoming more for disaster recovery rather than for rotation, then you'll see that the typical 9% to 10% decline in transportation and being offset by 40% or 50% by the growth in new products. But specifically, our Data Management business includes both the data protection and the tape business, as well as our film and sound business, which we had a very large project for a studio.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I got it. I think what you just said was the transportation business was down about the same as first quarter, we had some more new services in the first quarter, expect more of it for the rest of the year, but not as much in the second quarter, with a large project a year ago?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, no, the only thing – the first part was right, but we had the same amount of growth in the new service products in Q2 as we did in Q1. So roughly, what I'm saying is that what you can expect is that, the underlying business in Q2 was like Q1 if you took out the large project. So you had transportation going down to 9% to 10%, and then you had new services offsetting about 40% to 50% of that decline. So in other words, you end up net in the mid-single-digit decline in terms of the service revenue of that business. And we expect that trend to be similar in Q3 and Q4.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yeah, it was at this time in Q2 last year, this film and sound project, so it screws up the comparisons, but Q3 should be about normal.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And that was just one quarter, right? We don't have any tough comps on the film project going into the second half, right?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.: No, it was a Q2 issue.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks for the time.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It was a nice issue to have last year, I should say. I'm not saying that having large project is an issue. It's just explaining it a year later how they roll in and roll out?
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. No, I'm sure it was a fun project. I appreciate it, thank you.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, Andrew.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks, good morning guys. So I wanted to ask a little bit just for an update on pricing trends, particularly in Europe, given that the organic volume gains were up pretty nicely, but total organic was flattish. I think you mentioned some contract renegotiations. So, maybe just an update on what's going on in the pricing environment would be helpful?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.: Yes. In Western Europe, we had a couple of things, one affected last year, and then also impacting this year. So in Q2 of last year, we actually had a gain as a result of some renegotiations that went on at that point to do with a specific project and specific customer. This year, we had a couple of customers that went the other way in terms of the renegotiations that we had, which obviously, you have a sort of strong quarter last year and a relatively weak quarter this year. So you got a double impact in terms of the growth rate. I think in terms of overall, if you strip that out and then talk about overall pricing, in Western Europe, we do see a modest price erosion over time because we have quite high price legacy base. So that's a phenomenon you'll see if you look in some of our historic numbers, that's not the case, say, for example, in North America, which is obviously a much larger business where the legacy base price is more consistent with the price that we get today.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. And just to illustrate Rod's point, it's typically in the UK, you see prices in p that you see in cents in the U.S. Now that was even more interesting before the Brexit. But anyway, so you do see this range in terms of the high legacy pricing in Europe.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. That's helpful and that makes sense. And then my second question is really just a clarification just to make sure that we have the right numbers. With the accelerated synergy benefits, it looks like for 2016 now you've got $18 million in net synergy benefit versus $15 million previously. But 2017 is still the same $80 million net synergy target, is that right? And then what's the ultimate synergy target? That still is unchanged at $105 million?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. What we've always said is that – that was a minimum synergy target and we'll see as we get closer to 2017 and into 2017 if that speed also translates into more. Right now, it's speed. But I think we've always said that once we start really understanding the consolidation opportunity, that could be more, but right now, I would keep your $17 million guidance in the overall synergy number where it is. But yes, so the – you're absolutely right. It's about speed right now.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Iron Mountain, Inc.: I think that's right, Bill. I think at this stage, it's sort of bit of upside this year, sets us up great for next year in terms of confidence around that number, but no change in the total yet for 2017. The big item we're looking at the moment is real estate consolidation, which we've always called out as a potential upside further down the line, but it's still early days in terms of the analysis there. There will be an update in quarters to come on that.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Okay, that makes sense, thank you.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks a lot.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, well, thank you very much, and I hope you all enjoy the rest of your summer. Have a great Labor Day and we'll speak to you on the Q3 call.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Executives: Melissa Marsden - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Analysts: George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker) Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Karin A. Ford - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.
Operator: Good morning. My name is Dushyanta and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain First Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. These go ahead.
Melissa Marsden - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Dushyanta, and welcome everyone to our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our President and CEO, who will discuss highlights of the quarter and progress toward our strategic initiatives; followed by Rod Day, our CFO, who will cover financial results. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. And as we have done in the past, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com, under Investor Relations/Financial Information. Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2016 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's supplemental, our earnings commentaries, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in our supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. And thanks to all of the investors, analysts on today's call for your continued support during the process of finalizing our acquisition of Recall. In fact, it was one year ago today that we announced the agreement in principle between our two firms. As you saw last week, we have now satisfied all conditions for closing and will do some next Monday, Australian Time. I cannot say enough good things about the dedication and focus required and demonstrated by our teams on both sides to get this transaction over the goal line. And I should add, it is this dedication of our teams that has set us up to hit the ground running with integration. I wish to thank my fellow team members for continued focus on the core business by delivering another strong quarter across all metrics, but most importantly, our earnings and cash flow results. What does this acquisition mean for Iron Mountain? From a commercial perspective, it enhances our global footprint, both strengthening our existing country presence as well as expanding our reach from 41 countries to 45, and strengthens our ability to reach both global organizations in mid-market businesses looking to benefit from our industry-leading expertise and solutions appropriate to their scale. The combined strength of our companies expands our ability to meet customers' information, management, and storage needs as they face increasing regulation, ongoing security threats, and seek to turn information into business value. You may remember a video we featured at our Investor Day last fall with customer stories about the trust they place in us. Today, the stakes have never been higher for organizations of all sizes to ensure their most critical assets are protected and accessible. They see us as their partner protecting what matters whilst also providing expertise, products, and services designed to get the most out of those assets. That trust is a cornerstone of our business. A big part of this trust is based not only on our dedication to high-quality service, but it is also derived from confidence our customers have in us to leverage our scale to the kind of innovation that allows us to serve them long into the future. The industrial logic of this deal is undisputable. And from a financial perspective, it enhances our 2020 strategic plan, delivering cash benefits that drive accretion, both on an FFO and an AFFO basis. This in turn supports attractive long-term durable dividend growth averaging 10% per year through 2018 as the synergies and benefits from transformation begin to flow through in approximately 4% growth per year annually thereafter through 2020. I won't go into the detail of synergies and accretion here, as I believe we've covered that thoroughly in the call we hosted on April 1 to announce the conclusion of regulatory reviews in the U.S., Canada and Australia. But I do wish to reiterate that the benefits of the transaction are compelling consistent with our strategy and importantly, consistent with our expectations in terms of the financial contribution. Now that closing is imminent, the challenging work of integration can begin. We have been refining and advancing integration plans across all functional areas of the combined companies, and it is encouraging to see how well the teams have come together to support the closing and prepare for a smooth combination. We look forward to welcoming Recall's customers, employees and shareholders. Turning to Iron Mountain's standalone results, first quarter financial and operating results were strong. Our financial results continue to demonstrate the durability of our core storage rental business. Total revenue growth in constant dollar of roughly 4% was in line with our longer term expectations, driven by constant dollar growth of 4% in both storage and service. Adjusted OIBDA constant dollar growth was about 7%, excluding charges associated with our transformation program and service initiative (sic) [transformation program]. We see consistent trends in constant dollar storage revenue growth for the remainder of the year, while constant dollar service revenue growth will continue to be a bit lumpy. Even with this lumpiness, we continue to expect positive internal service revenue, as well as service gross profit growth for the full year. Our results in the first quarter reflect the service revenue mix shift we discussed in recent calls with declines in transportation and handling related services, largely offset by growth in shredding, project revenue and DMS, which for Iron Mountain, refers to our imaging or scanning businesses. We are also beginning to gain some traction with new data management service offerings such as our secure IT asset destruction offering and our data domain venture with EMC. You may have also seen that yesterday we announced a new Iron Mountain cloud archive, offering a cost-effective, near-infinitely scalable repository for organizations needing to protect and preserve data for compliance, legal or value creation purposes. We'll be debuting this new solution at EMC World conference next week. As our mix shift continues, we will focus more on enhancing gross profit rather than gross margins as these new service offerings are often lower margin, but still generate attractive returns due to the minimal capital investment required. Turning to internal storage revenue, growth of 2.2% for the quarter was in line with the fourth quarter of last year and is compared with a particularly strong quarter in 2015. We continue to expect average storage rental internal growth to be north of 2.5% for the full year. Internal volume growth or net of acquisitions was positive in all segments and consistent with recent quarters' performance at 1.6% worldwide growth. Total gross volume of records from new and existing customers was roughly 30.5 million cubic feet over the trailing 12 months also very consistent with what we've seen over the past few years. Turning to progress on our strategic plan. During the quarter, we continue to advance each of the three pillars of the plan as well as in the foundational elements that support it. Let me briefly highlight progress in each of the three pillars, namely getting the most out of our developed markets, expanding our presence in the fast-growing emerging markets, and expansion and faster growing adjacent businesses. In developed markets, we achieved consistent performance from North America RIM with positive internal storage and volume growth, while North American data management and our Western Europe segment both generated internal volume growth of roughly 3% and total internal revenue growth of about 2%. In emerging markets, our goal is to expand our presence and leverage our scale driving these markets to 20% of our total revenue by 2020. Recall's footprint in Southeast Asia will support that objective, but prior to the combination, we already have driven our emerging market business to 15% of total revenue on a constant dollar basis as of the end of Q1. During the quarter, we continue to achieve total internal revenue growth in these markets of 10% with internal volume growth of 7%. Additionally, as our visibility on closing of the Recall transaction became clearer, we resumed acquisition activity moving into two new emerging markets during the quarter. We acquired a 75% interest in the largest privately owned and the number two overall records management company in South Africa, a company with more than 2 million cubic feet of storage and a range of offerings similar to ours. We also acquired a Lithuanian-based document storage and archiving firm during the quarter, expanding our presence into three new countries in the Baltics with the acquisition of this market leader. With these acquisitions, we expand our global reach and now operate in 41 countries on six continents. But it's not about putting pins in the map. It's about leveraging our global footprint and capturing the first wave of records management outsourcing occurring in these faster growing markets. As we noted last quarter, we did see the carryover of the large single customer destruction in our other international segment, which drove destructions up to 4.2% in this segment in line with what we saw last quarter. Again, we do not see any other such unusual destructions on the horizon and expect that the remainder of the year will return to more typical levels of less than 4%. We do report volume change on a trailing 12-month basis, and therefore this level will remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters. As for adjacent businesses, we are on track to achieve our stated goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. You can now see a full quarter's contribution from Crozier Fine Arts acquired last December, which is performing in line with our expectations. Additionally, you may have noted our plans to expand our data center business into Northern Virginia, North America's largest data center market. Northern Virginia is also home to the Federal Government data centers and large cloud data centers owned by the major data center REITs. During Q2, we plan to resell this land to an industrial developer who will undertake land development and shell construction whilst we focus on expanding our data center product offering in this highly desirable location. We are early in the planning for this multiyear, multiphase project. Whilst we are not yet sharing specific projections, we wanted to share our plans to provide some insight into one of the ways in which we are able to strategically fund our growth opportunities. The result is that whilst we will achieve slightly lower margins through this approach to funding, the impact on our balance sheet has improved and our stabilized ROIC is similar to that of data centers we owned outright. To sum up, we are well on track to achieve our combined goal of having the expansion of our emerging market presence and adjacent businesses yield 25% of our total revenue mix by 2020 with internal growth rates in the 10% plus range, which is up from a little over 17% (sic)[70%]of our business mix today. I should also add we continue to make progress on our transformation initiative. Actions in 2015 resulted in run rate savings of $50 million, which is visible in a 120-basis point improvement in year-over-year OIBDA margins this quarter after adjusting for transformation. We have undertaken additional actions in the first quarter that support the additional $50 million of savings we expect to achieve by year-end 2016. We incurred told charges of $5.7 million in the quarter related to these actions and were able to pull forward a bit of the run rate savings that contributed to our strong performance this quarter. Also as previously disclosed, the remainder of the total $125 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017 and the full amount for the transformation program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. The all-important cash flow result for both today and growth into the future is in line with the growth expectations we highlighted during Investor Day and again on our April 1 call and continues to provide the foundation for our expected dividend growth. We also updated the high-level goals associated with our 2020 plan. What we've communicated is that we continue to expect to achieve similar top line and adjusted OIBDA compound annual growth. We also expect to generate similar levels of cash available to grow the dividend by an average of about 10% per year through 2018 and 4% annual growth thereafter, fund organic growth racking investment and increase the amount of remaining cash available to support discretionary investment. And we will do so whilst both reducing our payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO and deleveraging. We expect to fund additional growth through debt financing in amounts that allow us to continue to delever the business on a debt to EBITDA basis. Our expectations are underpinned by the continued demonstration of a very durable growing business that performs consistently throughout business cycles. In addition, we are extending that durability through solid execution of our plan in developed markets, identifying and capturing opportunities in both emerging markets and adjacent businesses and continue to enhance our cost structure in both service and overhead. Our durable storage business generates more than $1.5 billion of annual storage net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability and is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in good and bad times. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks Bill. I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including an update on our transformation initiative and a review of results by segment. Then I'll provide color on the Recall transaction and progress we have made so far in preparing for integration, as well as discuss our plans for funding the transaction. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. For the first quarter, reported revenues were $751 million compared with $749 million in 2015. Excluding the year-over-year FX impact of approximately 3.6% or $26 million. On a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 3.8%. Total revenues were driven by strong constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of approximately 3.9%. Service revenues also performed well in the quarter up by 3.7%.This was primarily the result of project revenue in North American records and information management and growth in shred revenues driven by new customer wins. This service revenue growth reflects the mix shift in our business were service revenues are more heavily weighted towards projects which can result in more volatility in year-over-year growth rates. During the quarter we saw a reduction in service gross profits and service gross margin. This decline was driven by an increase in medical expenses and severance costs related to our service gross margin initiative. Excluding these costs, service gross margins would've been flat on a year-over-year basis. Consistent with prior quarters we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share which explain key variances in year-over-year per performances for the quarter. This quarter, we've also added a similar bridge for FFO per share. This schedules on page 20 through 23 of the supplemental. Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $235 million compared with $231 million in 2015. Despite FX headwinds early in the year, we grew adjusted OIBDA by 1.7% and by 4.5% on a constant dollar basis. And growth was 7% if we exclude the $5.7 million of transformation initiative charges we took in the quarter. As evidenced by improvement to total adjusted OIBDA margins, we continued to execute on our transformation initiative. As just stated, during this quarter, we incurred roughly $6 million of net charges related to this initiative. During Q2 and Q3 prior to any adjustments from Recall, we continue to expect the transformation initiative to be $1 million to $2 million net negative to adjusted OIBDA with in-quarter costs slightly offsetting benefits. In Q4 we expect a net upside of roughly $7 million providing a strong run rate platform for year-on-year benefits in 2017. We continue to expect exit rate savings from actions taken in 2016 of $50 million to flow through to 2017. Our overall savings outlook for transformation remains consistent with what we laid out in our Investor Day in October with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.33 compared with $0.32 in 2015. Excluding the cost of our transformation, and after normalizing for the tax rate benefits adjusted EPS would've grown by roughly 9%. Our adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS result for the quarter came in ahead of the phasing expectations we laid out on the February's conference call. This over performance in the first quarter was driven by pulling forward portion of transformation benefits as well as lower overall G&A expenses as we delayed certain costs and hires in anticipation of the recall transaction. In addition adjusted EPS benefited from a lower tax rate. Our structural tax rate for this quarter came up to be 14.0% compared with 16.2% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in our structural tax rate was primarily driven by earnings mix skewed more towards our qualified nontaxable entities. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be roughly 20% once Recall closes due to their exposure and international markets. Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.51 for the quarter compared to $0.50 in the year ago period. Excluding the cost associated with the transformation FFO per share would have grown by roughly 8%. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $142 million compared with $128 million in the year ago period. AFFO is at the high end of expectations due to the timing of maintenance capital expenses and non-real estate investments which are typically incurred towards the second half of the year. Similar to the prior quarter, on page 19 of the supplemental providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations as presented in our GAAP cash flow statement, so you can more readily see the cash items that are not of the typical recurring nature. Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management or RIM, internal storage rental revenue increased by 0.2% for the first quarter. North American RIM internal service revenue increased by 3.8% due to an increase in project revenue and new customer wins in the shred business is noted earlier. North American RIM adjusted OIBDA margins decline year-over-year, primarily due to increased medical costs and severance charges related to our service margin initiative. North American data management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.8% for the first quarter. Internal service revenue in DM declined by 6.9% as we continued to see reductions in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. The high single-digit decline in transportation and handling service was partially offset by mid single-digit growth in the new data management service offerings and other DM project related revenue. DM adjusted OIBDA margins improved year-over-year due to an increase – due to decrease in overhead costs, primarily associated with lower G&A expense. The Western European segment generated solid results with 2.1% internal storage rental growth. Internal service revenue growth declined in this segment, primarily as a result of activity declines in retrieve and re-file and transportation and a relatively weak quarter for projects. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved in Western Europe as a result of a decrease in overhead expense specifically compensation expense. In addition, Western Europe benefited from one-off real estate tax benefit of roughly $3 million. The other international segment, which is made up primarily of emerging markets in Australia showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 9.6% and service internal growth 11.3% for the quarter. Other international adjusted OIBDA margins were 21% for the quarter in line with expectations. We continue to expect adjusted OIBDA in this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the low 20% range in the short-term as we expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. Let me now talk about the Recall acquisition and provide details on the cost that we've incurred so far in 2016. We're working diligently on integration planning, as well as preparing to convert portions of Recall's business to our REIT structure. As a result of all this hard work, we're well-positioned to achieve our synergies quicker in 2016 than we originally anticipated when we announced the deal back in June of 2015. Our expectations of cost to achieve the deal are still consistent with prior projections. In the first quarter, we incurred $7 million of deal close costs and $11 million of integration related costs, bringing the total of Recall costs in Q1 to roughly $18 million in operating expenses. Please note these expenses are excluded from adjusted OIBDA calculations because they are one-time in nature. Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on page 12 of the supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent. We remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. As we noted, our 2016 guidance reflects a partial year benefit from Recall as well as the net synergies we're expecting in 2016. Please note this is a preliminary view of the combined group and assumes that all divestitures are effective from May 1st. We'll continue to refine our estimates and provide updates as necessary once the transaction is closed. Another point about the guidance as you might expect given that we're combining our higher margin business with Recall's slightly lower more margin business, in the near-term adjusted OIBDA margins will be slightly lower than our standalone margins until we realize synergies. Lastly, I'd like to note that we're starting to see improvement in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, which may potentially add some favorability to our 2016 guidance. The top currencies that improved since beginning of the year are the Canadian dollar – euro; Brazilian real and Australian Dollar, partially offset by the declines in the British pound. We're continuing to watch these trends closely and will update our guidance one warranted. Moving to our expected cash available for distribution and investments for 2016, we continue to estimate that it will be roughly $600 million for 2016. This continues to provide ample dividend coverage and funds our core growth racking investments. Our capital deployment plans remain unchanged. We continue to expect capital expenditures, which include real estate and non-real estate maintenance and non-real estate investment to be in line with the figures we provided on April 1st We expect to spend $17 million in core growth racking and approximate $35 million in the data center business. For M&A, our plan continues to be a roughly $100 million spend in emerging markets and $50 million in developed markets. We also plan on investing where value creation is compelling in real estate development and consolidation and lease conversions. Dividend expectations remain consistent with the guidance we laid out on at Investor Day. Dividend per share is expected to grow in the double digits on average in 2017 and 2018 as we realize the benefits of transformation savings and Recall synergies. Beyond 2018, we expect to grow dividend per share at roughly 4% per year. Importantly the dividend payout ratio as a percentage of AFFO is expected to be approximately 78% in 2016 and 70% by 2020, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, at year end we had liquidity of approximately $650 million and our lease adjusted debt ratio is 5.7 times as expected. We announced last week that we entered into a commitment letter with lenders to provide an unsecured bridge facility of up to $850 million to provide a portion of the financing for the Recall transaction. We expect to enter into a definitive formal documentation for the bridge and follow – borrow the full amount on April 29. As previously said, we anticipate refinancing the bridge and replenishing capacity on the revolver with long-term debt as soon as practical. Overall, we're pleased with the strong performance we saw in the first quarter. Our results are driven by the durability of our business and execution of our 2020 vision. We're excited to begin the integration of Recall in the second quarter and begin to realize meaningful synergies associated with the deal. Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our short-term and long-term goals. We remain focused on extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth in our cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Bill.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Rod. And before I turn the call back to the operator for questions, let me quickly sum up what you've heard today so far. First, this was a very good quarter, and we are headed into the Recall integration from a strong position. Our core storage business performed well and remains extremely durable, a characteristic that has been demonstrated both in good economic conditions as well as through downturns. And if you recall, last year, we finished the year with a 1.5% internal revenue growth rate, i.e., before acquisition, and our Q1 results showed a 2% internal revenue growth rate, which also compares favorably to the Q1 of last year of 1.4%. So – it was a good quarter also in terms of revenue growth. Second, we're feeling good about the Recall transaction. Our progress on integration and our ability to derive benefits from scale which supports additional growth in cash flow. And finally our high-margin business coupled with our focus on continuous cost control continues to give us high confidence in our ability to deploy that incremental cash flow into growth investment, deleveraging and near-term double-digit growth in our dividend per share. With that, operator, we're now ready for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In the North American tape business, services internal revenue declines remain elevated which suggests that we're still early in the cycle in terms of the tape rotation revenue decline process. When do you expect the decline in services there to normalize? And could you provide a status report on some of the newer services initiatives you have that can help offset the headwinds?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Hi, George. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So, we still don't see much of an abating of that trend. So we're not predicting the bottom – I mean it's – as I think I've said a few times, it's on the records management side, we have seen a flattening out, but on the tape, it's a little bit behind the curve. What's encouraging is that we see high single-digit, low double-digit quarter declines in the – what I would call the transportation or rotating the tapes, as you say, part of the service business, but we see mid-single-digit growth in those new services, which is what allows us to offset the rate of decline. So, we do see – albeit off a small base – but we do see significant impact in terms of growth to some of these new service offerings like the service offering I highlighted on the call with EMC.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Got it. And then looking ahead to the company pro forma for Recall, can you discuss what your expectations are for Recall's fundamental performance? What assumptions are embedded in your guidance with Recall? And if your due diligence findings confirm Recall's existing guidance?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll let Rod answer that in the more detailed aspect of the questions, but I think I'll just touch upon your last – the last part of your question in terms of what we found through the integration planning with Recall. And I think what we – the main difference – I think we talked about that on the April 1 call is we found that we've – what I would call more capital efficiency. So two areas specifically is we found in terms of maintenance CapEx. We feel very comfortable that Recall's maintenance CapEx will be in line with what we spend on our facilities, i.e., around 2.6% of revenue, whereas before we thought we were going to have to spend more because they had done a number of acquisitions. So we feel comfortable based on integration planning that it's kind of a like-for-like integration in terms of level of maintenance CapEx. The other area which we feel very comfortable now which was an unknown for us is we had a significant uptick or original budgeting for IT systems because again we didn't know if our platforms would be big enough to scale efficiently to absorb all of the Recall operations. And again, we feel very comfortable. So you'll see that we still have significant investment to absorb the Recall operations onto our IT platforms, but much more in line that we're taking on a company that's a quarter of our size rather than one that we would have to rebuild or relaunch major IT systems. So those are then the two areas which I would say are positive surprises that we've had on the integration side, but, Rod, you may want to comment a little bit more in terms of the guidance.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, in terms of the assumptions we've made for Recall performance for the remainder of this year is essentially is consistent with the performance that we've seen over recent periods. So we've just trended that forward. So it's a modest underlying growth within the business of around 2%, and there's acquisition benefit on top of that. And margins being broadly and consistent so we've not assumed any inflection point up or down in terms of performance, just a continuation of the trend.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. I'd like to spend more time on the service internal growth of 3.8%. I did catch that you said it is more project oriented but this is kind of a massive standout, if you kind of look over the last four quarters versus 3.8% growth. Could you just give us a sense of – do you feel like there was anything that was particularly one time or are these projects you know that should come up regularly and do you think that service revenues will grow for the year within North American RIM?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So – its a good question, Andrew. So good morning. The – so, first of all, I would say that they are specific projects, but not necessarily one-time in nature. In other words, what I'm saying is we expect to continue to have these kinds of projects that we sell as we go through, but they're not – these are – it could be a project for company X today and company Y tomorrow. So these are discrete projects but not ones that we don't expect to have a recurring pattern. That being said, which I said both in my remarks, I think Rod also mentioned in his remarks, that these tend to be more lumpy. So I wouldn't change our guidance in terms of overall growth in terms of revenue, because you will see some ups and downs on that. So I would keep the guidance the same, and that's our expectation. But it is an area – you're right to call it out. It is an area that we're putting more and more discrete focus on as an initiative because we're hearing from our customers, they are looking for more and more those kinds of, what I would call, project related services as we kind of take their – a full management of their document from creation to storage approach. So just by the very nature, it is more project related. We have focused more of our attention in providing those kinds of services for our customers, so you can expect continued growth in that area, but it will be lumpy.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: But do you think it will be positive for the year?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It will be positive. Yeah. For sure it will be positive for the year. Yeah.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, this is Adam Parrington for Shlomo. Sorry, I apologize if I missed this, but could you go over the items that caused services or the margin to be lower year-on-year?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. I think probably it's best for Rod to take you through a bridge.
Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, let me do that. So if we look at the same periods last year, our service gross margin was 26.1% and this quarter we came in at 24.3%. There's really two key factors that's driving the difference. One is we had an increase in medical costs year-over-year that accounts for 1.0% of that differential. And the second is we took some severance costs in a number of our services businesses as part of a sort of ongoing program to drive longer-term improvements in margin. And that has an impact of 0.6%. There's a small other component which has to do with some vacation accruals. If you're to factor those in, we'd actually would have had a service gross margin of 26.2% and say that would compared to 26.1% from last year. So that's the drivers of difference.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And the one thing I would add, so – and you would expect our margins to be kind of similar year-on-year because the mix hasn't shifted that much. But what we've said, I think, on the last couple of calls, what you will see over time is not that we're not focused on margins, but we're less focused on the specific margin number because we're looking at return on invested capital as the mix of services change, because as I was talking – answering the question earlier about what's happening with transportation, for instance, in our data management or our tape business, the transportation typically is very high margin business. So as we supplant some of that revenue loss with new service initiatives, many of those have a lower margin, but they also have lower capital associated with them so similar returns. So – but I think the bridge year-on-year, you're not going to see a massive change in mix over time. So I think the bridge is important one on a short period of time to see what's really happening.
Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Got it. And there's a decline in maintenance CapEx due to the timing of the Recall acquisition or some other item?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. Again, I also referred to that in the prepared remarks. It is a timing issue. We typically spend more of our maintenance CapEx in the back half of the year than in the first half. And so, it's just a similar trend that we're seeing this year. We'll obviously – well, to your point, it is one of the items we will be evaluating as well as sort of post-close of Recall, but at the moment, our guidance on that for the full year still stands.
Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.
Melissa Marsden - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Operator, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator: Your next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Baird.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): That was great.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know where Kevin was, but it must have been fun.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I was just hoping that you could talk a little bit about the pricing characteristics by the major markets that you break out, Bill. Are you seeing any change in the marketplace? That would be helpful. Thanks.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. It is a good question. I think I understand the question behind the question because in some of the markets we highlighted, there were some of the segments we highlighted is that volume was growing faster than revenue, if I understand where your question is coming from. I think the – I wouldn't read too much into that. I think generally, our guidance is the same that we're achieving inflation or a little bit more than inflation in terms of pricing in each of our markets. So it does look a little bit odd in this quarter that you see in a couple of segments where we actually achieved higher volume growth than total revenue growth on a storage basis. I think that's more driven by a couple of things. One is, that in one of our business lines, we had a major – a very large customer major renewal, and I think as we've talked about before is when we have large customer renewals is you get this sawtooth where at the renewal point is you take a discount, and then it climbs up through that period. So there was a little bit of that going on. And then specifically in Europe, we had a market where we successfully took on a very large public sector customer which has actually similar pricing as, say, a lot of our other developed markets. But because of the historical volume of some customers just reaching their natural life or some of the boxes of natural – of customers reaching their natural life going out. At the same time you have a – what effectively looks like a dilution effect, but overall, our pricing still continues to track. If we look at it over a 12 months or kind of a trailing basis, we expect it to continue to track to be slightly ahead of inflation. So you'll see that kind of go back into the normal zone.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then just another question. I asked this maybe a year ago, but I thought maybe ask it again now, which is, your view on Iron Mountain's need and desire to be in shredding as the company gets bigger, as – still another year into the REIT. Thinking about it, I wanted to understand your thoughts on that business?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think as I probably said a year ago, we like all of our businesses, we never fall in love with any of our businesses. So you know, I would say the same thing about shred or any of our portfolio of businesses. I think – look, we're getting some good growth out of the business. We – when we sold off the Australian and the UK business, I guess, a little over year ago that was because we didn't think those markets we had the scale to actually do it. I think we're getting a nice turnaround or improvement in our business in North America. That being said, we look at all our businesses but not just shred. We look in geographies. So businesses and geographies we look at it on a portfolio of basis. And if at some point we feel that there is a better owner for either a business line or even a geography of a – what you might think is even a core business line, we will consider that. So there are no plans, but we're pretty disciplined on a capital allocation approach across our portfolio of management.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think maybe just one thing to add on shred. It's not a short-term performance problem for us. Certainly in the last few quarters we've seen some good traction in terms of new customer wins which has helped boost revenue, and there has been some good work actually driving the underlining efficiencies within the business. We also saw the paper price for shred recycled paper start to stabilize.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): That was my follow-up. You guys mentioned that shredding is up. Is that paper price driven or new customer driven or can you press that out for us?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's primarily driven by new customers, and so we've had a couple of good wins.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I mean we – I think we've highlighted before. We've put a new leader in charge of that business and really kind of put a separate, almost managing it as a separate business unit about a year ago, and he's really doing a stand-up job on it. I mean, he is taking a very different approach to driving that business. I think too much before we were focused on chasing customers rather than managing windshield time, and that is a business that lends itself to route density. So different approach, very strong leader and as a result, we're getting good results from that business.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Is there – are you seeing a competitive dynamic with the ownership change in your competitor there in North America? Are you able to – is that a source of the new customers?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I wouldn't say that. I mean, I guess you're talking about Stericycle taking over Shred-It, but I think, look, it's – our sense is it was run as a separate business unit when it was PE-backed, and it's run as a separate business unit – in fact it has the same leader of that business now as it did before when it was owned by the PE firm. So I think it's pretty much the same competitive dynamic that we had before, but I think we're just doing a better job quite frankly than we were before. Not that we were doing a bad job before, but we just have a much more singular focus on day-to-day management of it.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Karin Ford with MUFJ.
Karin A. Ford - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about storage rental revenue internal growth. 2.2% in 1Q. I think you said in your remarks that you're still expecting it to be up roughly 2.5% for the year. What do you think is going to drive the acceleration later on in the year there? And what are you seeing in terms – which segments are – how are they trending?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, good morning, Karin. So I think a couple things. One is, I think if you look at the 2.2% this quarter, it's in line with what Q4 was and as much of anything driven by that we had a 3% increase in Q1 last year. So it's a quarter on quarter, in other words, it's a high comparable versus last year. So it's the main thing that's driving the – or one of the main drivers of driving it. The other thing which we said is that we expect a ramp through the year. I mean, we feel like we're well on track. But that's why we said we expect still at the end of year to end up north of 2.5% in terms of internal storage revenue growth. The other thing you should go back, is important to look at, if we look at year-on-year comparison, if we look at just total internal revenue growth, total internal revenue growth for the company quarter one 2015 was 1.4% and we have delivered 2% this quarter and overall last year we had 1.5% and we delivered 2% this quarter. So we feel comfortable with the ramp even on a total revenue basis that we're achieving. And specifically, if we look at the storage rental revenue, as I say, you need to look at, quarter-on-quarter is we're looking at a very strong quarter in 2015 and then we have a natural ramp during the year.
Karin A. Ford - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.: Okay. So, easy comps plus a ramp later on in the year. Got it. Okay.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say more normal comps.
Karin A. Ford - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.: Normal comp. Okay, got it. Second question, a follow-up on a previous one. The internal service revenue growth performance that you got on 1Q going to be lumpy for the rest of the year, but net positive, are there any quarters that you're expecting from here to go negative on that line?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think you can probably appreciate, we don't guide by the quarter we have a lot of confidence as we look out the course of the year because we see the pipeline of projects, but the actual timing of those projects. You know, quite frankly, some of those projects came in earlier in Q1 than we expected, some of those we thought we are going to come in Q2. So the exact timing of projects are not in our control many times. So we feel comfortable with the pipeline and what we're going to deliver for a year-end result, but to give you quarterly guidance, we're not going to do that.
Karin A. Ford - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.: Okay. Are you seeing any impact from global economic turmoil on any of your international businesses today?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I think, I'll let Rod talk about it. He can give you a little more flavor about currency. I mean, FX is usually the thing that affects us but doesn't affect us from a liquidity because our costs in revenue are matched, but generally, the great thing about this business, its – maybe I shouldn't say battleship. That probably is – people don't like that analogy, but it just plows through basically any weather. I mean, the – if you look at the GFC [global financial crisis], we had positive rental revenue growth right through the GFC where of any of the company, whether self storage or industrial storage didn't have that. So first of all, even if we see turmoil, it doesn't really affect our business, and we don't see anything that would affect it, even a Brexit which – which Rod – which I think can probably comment on more than I can. So you know, we look at these things all the time. We do want to say that we are not complacent as a company as we do look at political risks when we make investments. And we think about the political risk both in terms of what could happen in that country in terms of economic turmoil, but also in terms of currency, but, Rod, you may want to comment a little bit on currency.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Maybe two things, Karin. Just in terms of currency, as I mentioned in the remarks, because we've actually seen a sort of slight weakening of the U.S. dollar more recently and that could be a favorable for us for the full year. So, across the basket of currencies, if things stay as they are, it would be a slight favorable. So, that – that's a negative if you like for us has turned around, I'm sure as for many other global businesses. In terms of the economic turmoil in certain markets, it's a good question but as Bill points out, we are relatively immune from that. So if I could pick an example such as Russia or Colombia or Brazil, which it's quite difficult straits and more broadly our business is actually performing well and to plan in those markets. It's really to do with the fundamentals of the businesses as Bill pointed out.
Karin A. Ford - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.: Great. And just last question for you, Rod, where do you think you could raise a long-term debt today, what cost?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's a good question. We think – well, we hope it will be in the sort of 5% to 6% range, but when we go to market, we will see what the conditions are, but we recently raised some U.S. debt a few months ago at 6% when the market conditions actually weren't as favorable as they are now. So hopefully we can get a bit below that.
Karin A. Ford - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.: Thanks very much.
Operator: 
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If there's no – it doesn't look like there's any further questions, operators. So first of all, I guess we'd like to thank everyone. I know it's a busy time of the year for dialing in and listening in today. And again, we're very excited that we think we've had a very good quarter, which is more importantly is giving us a very strong foundation and entry point into the Recall acquisition which we're really excited about. And the company hasn't done an acquisition that is this transformational probably since the Pierce Leahy acquisition, which was done my predecessor. So we're really looking forward to taking the strong quarter, layering on what Recall can bring as a next stage for growth in the company both in terms of cash flow and dividend growth. So thank you again and look forward to speaking to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the conference call. I will turn the call over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Melissa Marsden - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Cathy. Welcome. Good morning, everyone, to our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This morning we'll hear first from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights and progress toward our strategic initiative; followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. After our prepared remarks we'll open up the phones for Q&A, and as we've done for the last few quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at ironmountain.com, under Investor Relations/Financial Information. Referring now to page two of the Supplemental, today's earnings call and slides will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2016 financial and operating performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's Supplemental, the earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in this Supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year financial and operating results that in every respect met or exceeded our expectations in constant dollars, with reported EPS for the quarter beating expectations. Our results continued to demonstrate the durability of our core storage rental business, even in these volatile times. Total revenue in constant dollars was in line with our guidance and constant dollar adjusted OIBDA was at the upper end of our range. We continued to achieve solid growth in storage rental revenue, as well as consistent volume growth in new records from existing customers. We also achieved service gross margins in line with our year-end exit rate goal, as well as growth in adjusted OIBDA. All of these accomplishments resulted in a very good 2015. I believe most of you are familiar with the strategic plan we outlined at our Investor Day last fall. To assist in tracking our progress against that plan we've modified the earnings commentary at the beginning of our supplemental disclosure to highlight key performance metrics. You'll note that in addition to our solid financial performance in 2015, we've made good progress against our objectives in each of the three pillars and in the foundational elements that support our strategy. As anticipated, the strength of the U.S. dollar continued to impact our reported revenue. However, when looking through to fundamental performance, we've achieved a significant turnaround in the business in the last two years. We've gone from negative internal growth in total revenue in both 2012 and 2013 to 1% positive internal growth, or prior to acquisitions in 2014. And in 2015, we achieved further improvement with 1.5% positive internal growth. This is a testament to the hard work our organization has undertaken to, first, achieve net Records Management volume in all major markets, enhance customer service and retention whilst attracting new customers, stabilize service revenue declines in Records Management, penetrate new emerging markets and advancing adjacent business opportunities. Turning to the pillars of our strategic plan in developed markets, our focus over the last two years on getting more growth from these regions has driven improved performance with positive internal storage growth, stabilizing Records Management service revenues and adding roughly three million cubic feet of net new records in 2015, prior to acquisitions. In emerging markets, our revenue has grown from 10% of the total in 2013 to 14.6% of total revenue at the end of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. We have a sizable deal pipeline and are confident we will reach our goal of 16% of total revenue from these markets by 2016, and 20% by 2020. Importantly, we're driving internal growth in these markets of roughly 10% per year, so just two points of our 20% goal comes from acquisitions. We resumed M&A activity in select emerging markets in the fourth quarter, closing on a transaction in India. We have adjusted our focus to account for Recall's footprint and expect to close a few transactions in the first half of 2016, including a couple in fast-growing new emerging markets with underserved demand for records management. As we've noted in recent calls, despite the impact of the strong dollar on reported revenue, we mitigate our FX exposure at the income level because our expenses are denominated in the same local currencies as our revenues, and we are increasingly moving more of our debt outside the United States. The net of this is that we exceeded earnings expectations for the fourth quarter. Additionally, using strong dollars to invest in high-growth markets outside the U.S. gives us a lower cost basis and sets us up to realize significant value creation as the economic growth in these markets, over the longer term, will typically outpace that of the United States. I should note that in our Other International segment, which is emerging markets plus Australia, we did see a higher level of destructions in Q4 driven by a single large customer, which will carry over into Q1 of 2016. However, we do not see any other such unusual destructions on the horizon and expect that destructions for the remainder of the year will return to more typical levels. But we do report volume change on a trailing 12-month basis and therefore this level will remain slightly elevated over the next few quarters. We also have a goal to generate 5% of our total worldwide revenue from adjacent businesses by the end of 2020, up from just 2% at the end of 2015. Today, our adjacent businesses consist of our data center operations and our recently acquired art storage business. We closed on Crozier Fine Arts storage in December and are pleased with how it is being integrated into our business whilst retaining the DNA and key management talent that made it the leading art storage business in the United States. We believe the billion-dollar estimated global market is poised for the same type of consolidation opportunity we saw in the records management business years ago, and we have a plan that can take it to $100 million within three years. We had a fairly aggressive goal for 2015 to finish with an adjacent business revenue run rate of $50 million from a starting point below $20 million. We achieved that with roughly a $20 million revenue run rate from our data center business and $30 million from art storage. This all supports our planned shift in mix by 2020 to have 25% of our revenue coming from both emerging markets and adjacent businesses that have internal growth rates closer to 10%, up from 15% of our revenue in these higher growth businesses today. In terms of the foundational elements of our strategy, we have made significant progress on our Transformation initiative, effecting changes that have resulted in $50 million of net savings in 2016. We are finalizing the next set of initiatives that will deliver an additional $50 million of savings by year end 2016. As previously disclosed, the remainder of the total $125 million of overhead savings will be actioned in 2017 and the full amount for the Transformation program will be reflected in our 2018 adjusted OIBDA. Importantly, the cost to achieve these savings in each year is offset by the savings. As a reminder, we don't exclude the Transformation costs from our adjusted financial measures, but we do detail the amounts in the bridging schedules in the supplemental. Rod will have more on the timing of expected Transformation related costs to 2016 in a few minutes. We continue to work toward closing of the Recall transaction and related integration planning. As outlined at our Investor Day, we have detailed workstreams for virtually every functional area of the combined companies, and I am pleased with what I am seeing in the way our teams are working together on integration planning to create a dynamic combined entity and facilitate a smooth transition. Obviously, this transaction is compelling in terms of strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive accretion. As we work through the regulatory process, we will refine our views based upon a clear understanding of the outcome. We are constructively engaged with the four principal regulators and are working hard towards closing the transaction in a timely manner. As you know, it is necessary for us to close early in a given quarter in order to convert Recall's operations in certain countries into our REIT structure. We will provide updates with respect to the timetable when we have substantially completed the regulatory review process. But at this time, we cannot answer any questions about regulatory outcomes on today's call beyond what we have already said. In addition, we view real estate as a foundation to our strategy. During the year, we invested roughly $171 million in real estate. We remain keenly focused on our capital allocation opportunity and think about real estate investment in four major buckets. Our first priority is to invest in growth racking to accommodate net new volume growth we achieve annually. This investment yields average IRRs in the high teens. Our next priority is real estate consolidation, which may include both buildings and racking to improve real estate and operating efficiency and enhance utilization. This is characterized by mid-teens IRRs. Third, we plan to continue to invest in data center in a success-based manner driven by customer commitments. We continue to see good opportunity here with low double-digit IRRs and stabilized mid-teens return on invested capital. Fourth, we also look to complete select opportunistic lease buy-ins where we can acquire buildings at attractive valuations relative to market pricing or where it is strategically important to own. Rod will have more on how we view our real estate investment opportunities for the coming year. Now touching on some key financial and operating achievements before turning it over to Rod. On a constant dollar basis, we grew total revenue in 2015 by 2%, reflecting continued storage rental gains of 4%. This was driven primarily by storage rental internal growth of 2.7% for the year, reflecting continued strong growth from Data Management, Other International and Western Europe. As we look out into 2016, we are seeing consistent trends and maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth in the mid-2% range. Service revenue growth for the year was negative 0.4%, and we delivered positive at 0.3% internal service growth revenue for the quarter. We made good progress on our service margin initiative, exiting the year at 27.2%, right in the middle of our range. There will be ups and downs as the mix shifts to more non-recurring projects and there will be a downtick in service margin early in the year, but we expect it to ramp up again throughout the year and to result in a similar average margin for the full year. Also as previously mentioned, in 2016 we will also focus on growing overall service gross profit as we move forward and our service mix evolves. Although some of our new offerings have lower margins than our core activity base services such as transportation and handling, they are also less capital intensive, so they have very similar returns. Storage volume growth is another important indicator in our business. During the year, we once again grew net worldwide storage volume by 8 million cubic feet or 2.3% net growth and 1.6% prior to acquisitions, and gross volume of records from new and existing customers was roughly 42 million cubic feet over the trailing 12 months. Our customer retention remains strong at 98%, underscoring the stability of our customer base in supporting the durability of the storage revenue stream. This level has been stable over the past six quarters and represents an appropriate level in our business. Lastly, and most importantly, our cash generation is an important metric as it supports growth in dividends and investment. In recent presentations, we laid out our expectations for cash available to support the dividend, both on a standalone basis and including Recall. We expect to fund additional growth through debt in amounts that allow us to continue to delever the business on a debt-to-EBITDA basis. On a standalone basis, the continued strong and durable cash of the base business, coupled with the Transformation program, will at a minimum allow us to increase the dividend per share by 15% between 2015 and 2018, whilst reducing leverage by 0.4 of a turn. Even with an increased dividend in Q4, we improved our year-end 2015 payout as a percentage of our AFFO from 82% at Investor Day to 78% at year end. Including Recall, our minimum dividend per share delivers 24% growth between 2015 and 2018. This is all without issuing equity beyond the shares issued to purchase Recall. Looking ahead, all of these drivers support our updated constant dollar guidance for 2016. On a like-for-like basis or comparing our 2016 constant dollar guidance with our 2015 results using 2016 FX budget rates, you can see our growth expectations are very consistent with what we showed at Investor Day. We expect 3% to 6% constant dollar growth in revenue, 6% to 8% growth in adjusted OIBDA and 6% to 13% growth in adjusted EPS. This growth is underpinned by nearly $1.5 billion of storage net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance in good and bad times. With that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Rod.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Bill. I'll begin today with an overview of our 2015 performance, including a review of results by segment and updates on our service gross margin initiative as well as our Transformation program. Finally, I will address our outlook for 2016, including a review of our capital allocation plans. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. For the full year, reported revenues were $3.01 billion, compared with $3.12 billion in 2014. Excluding the full year FX impact of 6% or $171 million year-over-year, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2.1%. Consistent with the full-year picture, revenues for the fourth quarter also grew by 2.1% on a constant dollar basis. As Bill noted, we did not have any meaningful acquisition activity for most of 2015, so our revenues for the year had a very limited contribution from external growth. Total revenues were driven by good constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of more than 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Service revenues were flat for the quarter and down 1% for the year. The decline in our constant dollar service revenue for the year was driven by the disposition of our shredding businesses in the U.K. and Australia in late 2014. Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance for the quarter and the full year. These schedules are on pages 22 through 26 of the Supplemental. Similar to last quarter, we have also provided a bridging schedule on page 27 to explain the sequential movement in our total service business gross margins. For our focused initiative we're continuing to align service costs with activity levels and revenue mix. Looking ahead, we expect modest reductions in our service gross profits during Q1, reflecting one-off severance costs and the timing of costs related to our growing mix of special projects. However, we expect service margins will recover to current levels throughout the year. Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $238 million, compared with $220 million in 2014. Despite FX headwinds, we grew adjusted OIBDA by 8% and excluding FX by 14%. For the full year adjusted OIBDA grew by 4.4% on a constant dollar basis. As Bill noted, our Transformation program continues in 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, we expect to incur roughly $7 million of net charges related to this initiative. During Q2 and Q3, we expect the Transformation program to be $1 million to $2 million net negative to adjusted OIBDA, with in-quarter costs slightly offsetting benefits. In Q4, we expect net upside of up to around $10 million, so providing a strong run rate platform for year-on-year benefits in 2017. As Bill noted, we continue to expect run rate savings of $50 million to flow through to 2017. Our overall savings outlook for Transformation remains consistent with what we laid out on our Investor Day in October, with $125 million of cumulative savings by 2018. Looking at the overall phasing of contribution for 2016, we expect this to ramp up during the year for two reasons. Firstly, as I just discussed, the costs associated with our Transformation program are front loaded, with offsetting net benefits coming later in the year. Secondly, our storage volumes and revenues will grow through the year as they typically do. As such, excluding any extraordinary events, we believe that Q1 adjusted OIBDA will represent roughly 21% to 23% total adjusted OIBDA, factored in 2016. Furthermore Q2 and Q3 will make up roughly 24% to 26% each and Q4 will represent roughly 26% to 28%. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.33, compared with $0.25 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $1.21, compared with $1.36 for 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-on-year is driven by an 8% increase in share count related to the special distribution we made in Q4 2014 following our REIT conversion, charges related to Transformation, and a high structural tax rate for the year. Including the increase in share count and restructuring costs in both periods as well as holding the tax rate constant, normalized adjusted EPS grew by $0.02 for the year. Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out as 16.8%, compared with 14.4% in the prior year and 16.5% in Q3 of 2015. The year-over-year increase in our structural tax rate was primarily driven by higher income from foreign jurisdictions. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 17% in the short-term. Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.57 for the quarter compared with $0.52 in the year ago period, driven by improved performance. For the full year, FFO per share was $2.10 per share compared with $2.28 in 2014. The decline was driven by FX headwinds, the increase in share count as well as restructuring charges related to our Transformation program. Including share count increases, FX and restructuring charges in both periods, FFO per share grew by 3%. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $125 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $112 million in the year-ago period. For the full year, AFFO was $522 million compared with $527 million in 2014. If we adjust for FX in the items mentioned earlier that impacted FFO, except for share counts, then AFFO grew by 3% year-on-year. On page 21 of the Supplemental, we're now providing a reconciliation between AFFO and cash flow from operations as presented in our GAAP cash flow statements, so you can more readily see the cash items that are not of a typical recurring nature. Let's turn to our financial performance by segment. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue was up 0.2% for the fourth quarter and 0.1% for the full year. North American RIM internal service revenue declined this quarter due to the continued decrease in transportation, retrieve and re-file activity levels. In addition, we saw more of a precipitous decline in average price of recycled sorted office paper towards the end of the year, leading to a decline of over 19% quarter-over-quarter in average pricing. This impacted the paper revenue in our shred business and will have a follow-on impact into 2016. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remain solid at 41% for the quarter and 40% for the year, up from 39% in 2014. The year-over-year improvement in North American RIM adjusted OIBDA margins is driven by the service gross margin actions and better operational performance. North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.0% for the fourth quarter and 4.2% for the year. The growth in DM storage rental internal growth for the quarter was lower than recent periods due to a strong comparator from Q4 last year. Looking forward, we expect DM internal storage growth to be in line with the growth in total company storage internal growth around 2.5%. Internal service revenue in DM declined by 8% in the fourth quarter and 5.1% for the year, as we continued to see declines in the frequency of tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. During the fourth quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong at 53.7%, compared to 51.6% in Q3. For the full year, DM adjusted OIBDA margins are 52.2%. We expect DM adjusted OIBDA margins will remain in the low to mid-50% range as we continue to invest in new service offerings. Margins on new services, although high at 35% to 40%, are lower than core storage margins of approximately 75%. The Western Europe segment generated solid results with 2.4% internal storage rental growth for the quarter and 2.7% for the year. Looking at internal service revenue, declines in activity were partially offset by increases in nonrecurring imaging and other projects. Adjusted OIBDA margins remain solid in Western Europe at 33.1% for the quarter and 34.4% for the year. The Other International segment, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 9.6% for the quarter and 10.8% for the year. Service internal growth was 8.4% for the quarter and 9.0% for the year. Other International adjusted OIBDA margins were 23% for the quarter and 21% for the year. We expect to see adjusted OIBDA from this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in a low 20s% range in the short-term as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. To prepare for integration, in 2015, we incurred approximately $25 million of deal close costs and $22 million to prepare for integration, which brings total Recall related costs in 2015 to $47 million. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect $5 million to $8 million of deal close costs and $8 million to $12 million of integration related costs, bringing the total costs in Q1 to roughly $15 million to $20 million. Please note these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation as they are one time in nature. Importantly, these costs were outlined in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal. Let's turn to our outlook for 2016 on page 13 of the Supplemental. Business trends and fundamentals remain consistent and operationally we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. Please note I'm referring to the corrected version of the Supplemental that was posted just prior to the call. Our guidance for 2016 growth on a constant dollar basis remains fairly consistent with the preliminary guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call. We made two changes. Firstly, we updated our outlook to reflect the new constant dollar budget foreign exchange rates which was set in January 2016. Note that at this point, that our 2016 constant dollar budget rate is now equivalent to an R (sic) [reported] dollar rate since it was just set last month. Secondly, we have reduced revenue and adjusted OIBDA by approximately $10 million at the midpoint as a result of the decline in the shred recycled paper prices that I noted earlier. Revenue from paper recycling is almost all margin, and so the vast majority flows through to adjusted OIBDA. To provide further clarity, I'd now like to share with you additional detail of how FX has impacted 2016 guidance and walk you through the components of our expected 2016 adjusted OIBDA growth on a constant dollar basis. The FX headwind was primarily driven by significant declines against U.S. dollar in the following five currencies: Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and the euro. These represent about 28% of our total revenue. As a reminder, approximately 40% of our total revenues are denominated in non-U.S. dollars. Assuming our 2016 FX rates remain constant throughout the year, our guidance reflects a 5% decline in revenues from FX. In our Investor Day, we had anticipated a decline of 3.5% based on rates at that time. Given continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, our outlook represents an additional decline by the end of the year of 1.5%. This total decline translate into roughly $165 million for the year on the top line. As we move down the P&L, FX headwinds continue to impact our guidance, albeit at a lower dollar amount. The FX headwinds impacting the top line translates into approximately $50 million on adjusted OIBDA for 2016. As you can see on page 12 of the Supplemental, we reported constant dollar 2015 adjusted OIBDA of $940 million at 2015 constant dollar budget rates set in January 2015. When our 2015 numbers are translated into 2016 budget rates, adjusted OIBDA would've been $900 million. However, we're also expecting an additional impact related to FX of roughly $10 million as a result of a change in our contribution mix. As we noted earlier, we are also expecting a $10 million constant dollar impact from paper price declines. On a more positive note, we can add a $50 million benefit from Transformation. Adding all that up, we get to adjusted OIBDA for 2016 based on January 2016 rates of roughly $930 million. Adding onto that our expectation of roughly 2% to 4% constant dollar growth will get you the $950 million to $970 million, which is our 2016 guidance range. Lastly, moving to our expected cash available for distributions and investments for 2016, we expect it to be roughly $495 million at the midpoint for 2016. This continues to provide ample dividend coverage and funds for our core gross racking investment. Let's turn to our capital deployment plans. We expect our capital expenditures, which include maintenance and non real estate investment to be in line with the ranges we provided at our Investor Day. Real estate investment spend is expected to be about $265 million, driven by growth racking spend of about $60 million, data center investment of $35 million. We also plan on investing $170 million in real estate consolidation and lease conversions. For M&A our plan is roughly $100 million in emerging markets and $50 million in the developed markets. Our dividend expectation also remains consistent with the guidance we laid out on our Investor Day. As you saw last week, we announced our first quarter dividend of $0.485 per share, which is consistent with the $1.94 per share run rate from Q4 last year when we increased the quarterly rate by $0.01 per share. In addition, the $1.94 per share is the minimum projected dividend for 2016 in a combined basis with Recall. Importantly, we ended the year with a dividend payout ratio as a percent of AFFO of 78%, which underscores the strength of our dividend coverage. Shifting briefly to the balance sheet, at the year-end we had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion and a lease adjusted debt ratio of 5.6 times, as expected. Before concluding, I'd like to point out that we are updating our shelf registration statement with the SEC. You will likely see this filing next week. Please note that this update is part of our regular cycle. As we've said in the past, at this time we don't plan on issuing equity to fund investments outside the potential Recall acquisition. Overall, we've delivered good results for the year, supported by continued execution on our strategic plan, progress we've made in our Transformation initiative as well as the stabilization of our service gross margins. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to deliver on our short and long-term goals. We remain focused on creating shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives growth and cash available to fund dividends in core growth investments. And with that, I'll hand back to Bill to sum up.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you, Rod. Before going over to questions, just to sum up, by utilizing the levers available to us in this highly durable and cash generative business, we've been able to deliver a good year, which is distinguished by first demonstrating growth in the business, both with and without acquisitions; additionally by generating cash, which allows us to grow dividend whilst at the same time establishing a debt-to-EBITDA glide path which delevers over time; and finally by investing in our core business whilst building adjacencies which support the business well into the future. With that, I'd like to open it up to questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Just to say it very clearly, the only change in the 2016 guidance relative to the last time we spoke was FX and paper prices, right?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yep. That's right.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay. I wanted to dive a little bit into tape services decline. I know this is not a new thing in terms of frequency of rotation. But the decline, this is North American tape, was larger this time. What's your anticipation in sort of getting to that bottom of that cycle in terms of frequency? And how do you think the service side of tape will do this year?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning. No, I think it's pretty much the same as we said I think on the last call. I think it's bouncing between kind of the high-single-digit to low-double-digit declines in terms of what I would say our core service revenue associated with the transport of the tapes. And I think as we called out the last few quarters is that where we were on the paper record side of the business maybe two or three years ago, we're still watching that till it starts flattening out or we see the inflection point. And we don't see that inflection point right now, but at the same time we don't see it getting worse than what it is. I think what you'll see is, you'll see some bouncing around in terms of the net service revenue on the data management. I mean, quite frankly, I think we've done a pretty good job on building up some of these new service lines that in the tape management which includes the secured IT asset destruction business, for instance, and also the restoration assurance business, just to call out two. So on the transportation side, again, which is our highest margin in that type of business, we don't see a slowdown in that decline, but we don't see an acceleration either. But I think what we're -we're making some good progress in some of these new services which generally have lower margins than transport, but at the same time they have much less invested capital associated with it, so we're getting similar returns. So when those – I wouldn't expect this year that these new services are going to overtake the decline that we're seeing in the transportation, but we're making good progress.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Right. And then if you don't mind, I'm just going to ask about Western Europe. Service has really popped up in the quarter. Is there something there that really is unusual for the quarter? And how do you feel like we're entering the year on service side of Western Europe?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think it's a good call-out, Andrew. I think one of the things you probably caught in my remarks and a little bit in Rod's is that as we're shifting from the core transportation services that are associated with the ins and outs in our storage business to some of the new service areas, a lot of these new service areas are project based, which is also the reason why we said we expect kind of a downtick in Q1 in some of our service revenue as those projects have a lead time in terms of the sell and onboarding those cycles. And then they come through it in the next quarter or quarters and that's what you've seen actually in Western Europe. What you will have seen is there was an investment earlier in the year, and then that project revenue kind of flows through. So that's part of the new services. It's less smooth than say the transportation side of the business, so you have these ups and downs. So what we tend to do is we look at it over the course of the year and it just so happened that in Western Europe, you saw that spike as part of that normal cyclicality of these projects.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: All right. And if you'll let me sneak just one last in, so when you think about service side total for 2016, do you feel like it's going to solidify it more like we saw in the fourth quarter? Would that be the right word, solidifying services revenue?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think what we said is that we expect looking at the pipeline that we will have a similar margin by the end of the year as we achieved in 2015. So that's correct. And what you'll see is that we were, in Q4, we had positive service revenue growth overall in the year, slightly negative. So what we expect is service revenue to be basically flat and the margin to be in line, maybe slightly ahead, but it's going to be basically in line with what we achieved at the end of 2015.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think that's right. It might move around a little bit by a quarter, but I think that's actually right, Bill, for the full year. It's a good summary.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Your next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Morning. I'd like to go a little bit into the services business as well. Can you elaborate on the timing of internal initiatives that you think can drive upside or improvement in services' internal growth in 2016 versus 2015?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, so good morning, George. So I think there's kind of a couple aspects. There's some that – there's a number of things that you're touching upon or referring to that Patrick Keddy went through on Investor Day, things that we're doing just to get more margin out of some of our existing core service areas which have seen a drop in activity, so that's really around the transportation side. And I think we feel pretty good where that's coming out. I think you'll continue to see some improvement during the course of the year, but a lot of that is in flight. I think the bigger part of it is how we bring on some of the new service areas which are less smooth, but on a year basis these are project-driven. So you can think of it as like a defense contractor: there's a certain amount of prospecting and then there's a certain amount of reaping or harvesting. So you'll see on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you'll see some movement around that, but we have good visibility over the course of the year to be able to predict where the year will end up. So I think what you can expect as we go through the course of the year is we think that we will have similar slight uptick in terms of where we came in for the year in 2015, so slight improvement, but kind of in the same postal code for 2016 in service. But you will see as we shift away from the volume coming from almost exclusively the transportation side of the business to some of these new services that are more project based, you will see more ups and downs on a quarter-by-quarter basis just like Andrew called out for the uptick in Western Europe in Q4. And we're saying that Q1 you'll see a downtick in some of those services, but we have very good visibility over the course of the year where we'll come out.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Got it. Thanks. And looking at C$ revenue growth for the quarter and year, it came in a little bit below target because of lower M&A activity given your focus on Recall. You talked a little bit about your expected M&A activity in the first quarter. But with Recall still in progress, can you update us on how you're approaching your tuck-in M&A strategy for the full year?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So there's kind of two dimensions to that, right, George. So one is now that we've gone through quite a bit of the integration process, not on the commercial side, but we kind of know the people and the overall volumes that we're getting in different geographies, we have a pretty high confidence level of where it makes sense for us to continue to bolster our presence internationally. So that's kind of one dimension. So you saw for instance our acquisition the last quarter of last year in India. And there's a couple more in flight that are in, as we called out, in the emerging markets, right. The other aspect of that, of course, is you won't see us doing any M&A activity in the four regulatory jurisdictions that we're working with right now to close the Recall transaction because we don't want any delay in those discussions with the regulators, right. Because if you start doing acquisitions at the same time you're having discussions, it's just going to delay it. So we have pretty good visibility now where it makes sense. And that's why we've restarted the engine.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think that's right, Bill. I think, George that was in the nature of deals, particularly internationally, it can be a bit lumpy in terms of when they land. It was relatively quiet last year as you rightly pointed out. But I can see a reasonable amount of activity in Q1 actually with some, well I think, pretty exciting deals.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Did we lose you, Kevin?
Operator: Kevin, your line is open.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we got you, Kevin. Yep.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I apologize. Sorry about that, I was on mute. Apologize. Hey, so in terms of any updated timing on Recall? Do you still see it as Q2 type event? Or does that get pushed out a little bit based on – just any updates on that if you can to the extent you can provide further clarity on discussions with the regulators before? Just any thoughts around that?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Kevin, I think you were covering us during the PLR, no?
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yes.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I think you probably know how I'm going to answer this one. As I said in my notes, it's not much that I can say beyond – or anything I can say beyond in my remarks. So I think you could probably appreciate that...
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Sure.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But we remain excited about the deal. As I said on my prepared remarks is that we're engaged constructively with the four key regulators, and we're working hard to drive this to a close. But I can't – I think you could probably appreciate I can't say much more.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I figured I'd try, Bill.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I knew someone was going to try; I just didn't know who it was.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Would you give updates based on country? Or would it be when it's all done?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look, right now I think all four are – we're engaged in all four, so I think our expectation is it'll probably be coming together pretty much at the same time. I mean, I wouldn't rule out a country-by-country update, but I think right now my expectation is it's going to be fairly closely aligned.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: That's helpful. And then just – it looks like you tightened up the range a little bit on the on the internal growth for 2016. You took the low end up 50 bps, the high end down 50 bps, am I reading that right in terms of the notes? And then if that is right, what drove king of the tightening of that range?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Rod, do you want to...
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I don't think we've mentioned change in internal growth. This may be in total growth. And so the internal – it's only if we start with internal storage growth, we've always been sort of in the 2.5% to 3% range and, obviously, that's the key metric for us. On the total revenue outlook, you're right. I think we've sort of pulled it in slightly as a result of just having a better understanding of how things might pan out.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Awesome. And then are you at the point now where the sorted office – is the pricing still decremental? Or is it a point where it's stabilized, the sorted office paper?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It looks like it could've stabilized, but we've seen that before. So effectively what we've done in terms of our projection, we've taken the paper price out of that January. It could continue to move up or down, and we'll obviously keep updating on that, but where we did see the drop was really in the last couple of months of last year.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Awesome. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you for taking my questions. Could you just give us a little bit of color as to some of the service projects, the nature of those projects that are causing things to kind of go up and down, become a little bit more lumpy? Just a practical on the ground, what exactly are you guys doing? And then afterwards, can you just give us an update on the EMC partnership announcement last April and how that's moving?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Morning, Shlomo. I'll just give you kind of a couple examples that give you an idea. Some of them are large scanning projects, so there's some that are in flight with government contracts for instance, and they have a certain – that's why I kind of alluded to kind of like defense contracts, those things have a kind of a tilling, fertilizing, seeding process and then a harvesting side. And those are typically very large scanning projects that are associated with storage. So we're not going in to compete with an ACS or a Xerox per se. I mean, they may be competing, but we're going after contracts where we think we really have a strong skill set that's associated with just not the scanning, but also the classification of the records and in many if not most cases the actual storing of those records. But those are long lead time projects that come through at different times and hence you see the kind of spike that we saw in Western Europe when those things come through. Others are, again, what I would call kind of BPM-type projects that are associated with storage. So right now we have in sight a large project which is associated with mortgage servicing or helping mortgage originator to process and manage a lot of their documentation and processes associated with mortgages. Again, there's a big upfront piece and we have the relationship with that customer because we do, if not all, most of their storage. So those are kind of two different projects. One which I would typically call BPM, and the other one I would call scanning, but we come at it, and we've been asked to come in and provide these services because of our expertise around records management and record storage.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And the EMC...
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. On the EMC, so the EMC we're still very excited. We're making good steady progress, and the great thing about it is there's still a high level of engagement, even though you can probably imagine that EMC is going through their own changes right now with the Dell acquisition. But even with all that and through that process both pre and post announcement, we've had a high level of engagement and both teams are working well. I mean, it's starting on a small base, but we're very excited about that combination because to us this is kind of like the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, right. It's putting – I don't know if you could say who has the peanut butter and who has the chocolate, but putting those two things together and combining it with our raised floor platform using the data center is just a – it's a really unique platform that we could offer to our customers, which it's very difficult for any competitors to do because we're allowing customers to remove both the OpEx and CapEx associated with their tape drives in their premises and using EMC's market-leading technology or data domain technology. We can replicate their data center on our raised floor using our data center technology, and then deliver tapes off the back of that and store it in our vault, which is a perfect cyber-security play because I think what people have learned is that you're not secure around cyber-security unless you unplug it completely from any network, so that's where tape comes in. But at the same time, people can get rid of a lot of the OpEx and CapEx costs associated with cutting the tapes themselves, and you reduce the need to transport these things over the road, and many cases these tapes aren't encrypted. So that adds a much more secure environment. And then the other service of course we apply to that is we tell the customer, independent of any change in generational tape drives, we give them guaranteed assurance that we will restore that data whenever they need it in whatever format they need. So if you kind of look at some of the things that are in the core DNA of Iron Mountain, together with our growing data center business, and the core DNA of EMC, it is the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Are there any marquee clients yet that you guys are willing to name or you're allowed to name or that you obtained, but you can't name?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, at this point you could imagine because this really goes to the IT security of most of our customers, none of them – I mean, we keep working on that, and when we can we'll highlight them. I think I should highlight, it's still a relatively small portion of our revenue. But we're really excited about these types of programs because it really resonates with our customers. But I think you can imagine most of our customers are pretty secretive about the way that they manage their IT assets or IT information.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. For Rod, given the movements in currency and everything, are you able to maybe just give us a little guidance on the certain base rate percentage move in each of the currency that you highlighted, what that impact would be to both revenue and OIBDA up and down? So strengthening a certain – 1% against the dollar impacts revenue by X and impacts OIBDA by X, just so that from a technical modeling perspective we can get that rate?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, and probably the easiest thing to do, if you take it as 40% of our revenue as outside of the U.S. and so therefore if you kind of take a 1% delta on the dollar against the basket of currencies, that would impact our revenue by 0.4%. And then you can flow that down to OIBDA. I think the way to think about that is if the FX movement is against markets where our businesses are more mature, so I could say for example, Canada and the UK, there obviously we earn higher margins. And so it has a sort of disproportionate effect on OIBDA. If the FX movement is against some of our businesses in emerging markets, it tends to be more dampened at the OIBDA level because obviously they're at earlier stages, and so the contribution margin percent is lower. Don't know if that helps.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. I mean, percentage of revenue helps more than that, but as much as you can give us, we'll take.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think that's probably what I can give you.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ellman, with Mayo Capital Partners.
Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC: Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could just offer me a bit of clarification about the guidance summary on page 13 of the document. I'm not sure that I understood all of Rod's remarks. Do I understand that your guidance for adjusted OIBDA for 2016 is the $950 million to $970 million range that I see in the second column from the right?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. Yeah, that's exactly right. So page 13, it's the second last column on the right is our 2016 guidance based at January 2016 FX rates. So...
Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC: January 2016 FX rates?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, exactly. So that's...
Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC: Okay.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: ...our best view of guidance as we sit here...
Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC: All right. So just sort of taking the midpoint of that range, that would be $960 million, and then you present your estimated capital allocation at $555 million to $595 million?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yep.
Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC: Okay. And your dividend obligation is currently about $412 million at the $1.94 rate?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right.
Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC: Okay. So the dividend obligation, plus the midpoint of the capital allocation guidance would be $987 million?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right.
Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC: Okay. And so in your guidance for adjusted OIBDA you've obviously excluded the anticipated going forward expenses for the Recall consolidation which you've estimated at $15 million to $20 million?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yep.
Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC: And so are there any other foreseeable expenses that, being one-time in nature, you're also excluding from your estimate of adjusted OIBDA?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. No. So we have restructuring costs, but they're actually included within adjusted OIBDA, but they have a phasing impact as I referred to earlier.
Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC: Okay. All right, I guess that would be it. Could you possibly clarify in your capital allocation estimate of business and customer acquisitions of $140 million to $180 million, how much is acquisitions of business and how much is the money that you invest when you establish a new contract with customers?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That's really our M&A spend, so that's – we refer to business customer acquisitions, but it's really the M&A spend.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think the way you should think about it is that – I think I understand where you're kind of going with it, is that if you're trying to bring it down to cash available for distribution and investment, is that...
Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC: That would be fair.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Okay. So that's what I figured you were trying to get to. So if you look at 2016 and you take the midpoint of the guidance, you should get to $495 million, and then you had $412 million for the dividend, I mean, it's $411 million, $412 million. So you subtract that out and then there's about $65 million for growth racking, but that is actually for growth. So actually if you think about it, it's the $495 million less the $411 million and then that gives you a number that's available for growth basically, for investment and growth. And so the first call in that cash available is $65 million, which is for the organic growth that we get from our customers every year. So even if you take out, and that's for 2017 revenue if you know what I mean, right, because you're putting the racking investment in 2016, so that when the growth hits you in 2017 you can actually put those boxes on the shelf. So then even after you take the growth racking which gives you the mid-2% range that we highlighted in terms of internal growth, in terms of our storage business that leaves you about $19 million for cash available for discretionary investment. Now, that's versus 2015 actuals of about $3 million left over after you paid for racking. So we've actually – even with the further FX headwinds coming into the 2016 based on January rates, you see the improvement from $3 million to $19 million, but again, that's also already including $65 million for growth, so that 2.5% organic storage volume growth that's coming in. Now when you come down and you're trying to – to your point about M&A is – so you say: well, how are we able to delever and still be able to do M&A? Because of course when we're doing the M&A we're buying EBITDA as well associated with that. So we're – so that's how the whole thing works. So we are issuing debt to do the M&A because obviously $19 million doesn't fuel our whole M&A program. But between the $19 million that we have for beyond internal growth of storage, we also borrow, but on a net-net basis in terms of what it does is debt-to-EBITDA you see a deleveraging as well. So that...
Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC: Is there a debt-to-EBITDA target that you have, say, for the end of 2016? I think you said you were at 5.6 times currently?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: 5.6 I think, and we aim to hold it around that level, it would be 5.5 times to 5.6 times by the end of the year. And over the next three years it will come down to 5.2, excluding the Recall deal. If we did the Recall deal, actually allows us to delever faster than that.
Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC: Okay. Very good. Thank you very much.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And the only thing I would do is just one last thing, Michael, is if you go to our Investor Day deck it lays it out quite well because it shows you what happens to – we do it both on a standalone and with Recall, but it shows you how we grow dividends during that period of time, how we grow the M&A and how we delever during the period of time. And you'll see the cash available or the CAD in the appendix of that deck.
Michael Ellman - Mayo Capital Partners LLC: Okay, thank you.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. Do we have any closing remarks?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I think that's it, operator. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-10-30 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Faten Freiha - Director-Investor Relations William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Analysts: Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Adrian S. Paz - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker) Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Operator: Good morning. And welcome to the Iron Mountain Q3 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Faten Freiha, Director of Investor Relations.
Faten Freiha - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you, Hula, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This morning, I'll be filling in for Melissa Marsden, who couldn't be here with us today, due to a family matter. We'll begin the call with Bill Meaney, our CEO, who'll discuss highlights for the quarter and progress toward our strategic initiatives, followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. As we've done for the last few quarters, we've posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com under Investor Relations/Financial Information. Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2015 and 2016 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Faten, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be report a solid third quarter results that were at the upper end of our profit expectations and underscore the durability of our core business. It's based upon this continued demonstration of the growth and durability of our business that our Board of Directors has resumed our growth in dividends and has pull forward the dividend increase by declaring a quarterly cash dividend of $0.485 per share. I suspect most of you on the call today, either attended in person or listened to the webcast of our Investor Day about two weeks ago. Therefore, I won't go into a long discussion of our strategy, goals or longer-term expectations, as I believe time would be better spent on Q&A. That's said, I would like to briefly reiterate a few main points from our event and relate how our Q3 results fit within that framework. For those, who haven't heard the live event or listened to the replay, we laid out our vision for the year 2020, given that we are rapidly approaching the end of the three-year strategic plan that we introduced at our Investor Day in the beginning of 2014. More specifically, we described our past performance and go-forward vision for our three strategic pillars, developed markets, emerging markets and adjacent businesses. In developed markets, our strategic plan over the last two years has turned around these relatively flat internal growth markets and driven more than 7 million cubic feet of net new records, all prior to acquisition. In emerging markets, our sales expanded from representing 10% of total revenue in 2013 to 14.3% of total revenue by the end of Q3 on a constant dollar basis. These markets are growing 10% to 15% per year before acquisitions and our goal to reach 20% of total volume from these markets by 2020 is within our grasp. Roughly 18% of the 20% goal will be reached by internal growth alone. In adjacent businesses, we expect revenue to represent 5% of our total worldwide revenue in 2020, up from just 2% today. Currently, our adjacent businesses are comprised of our datacenter business and our recently announced acquisition of Crozier Fine Arts Storage, the leading arts storage business in the U.S. This is a natural extension of our film and sound business. Crozier comes with about a 0.5 million square feet of owned real estate and achieves about 10% sales growth per year before acquisitions. We anticipate closing this deal in December. This all adds up to a shift in mix with 25% of our revenue coming from faster growth markets and businesses by 2020. That's up from 15% today with a majority of increase coming from internal growth. The expected impact from this shift is that by 2020 annual internal profit will grow by roughly 5% or 7% with acquisitions versus 2% and 4%, respectively, today. We also enhanced our Transformation program to deliver a total of $125 million of overhead savings, up from the $100 million we announced this summer. You can see from the bridging schedules in the supplemental that we recorded $9 million of charges in Q3 related to this program. We expect to realize partial year benefit of the first $50 million in savings in the fourth quarter, offsetting this charge. The full $50 million annualized benefit will flow through in 2016 and beyond. And our next set of actions to be taken in early 2016 will represent another $50 million of annualized savings in 2017. So we're getting more from our efforts in this program and we're getting it faster than originally anticipated. We outlined our plans to continue to increase the percentage of owned real estate over time through our programs, which deliver improved operating economics with the consolidation of facilities. Lastly, we demonstrated future cash generation on a run rate basis to support growth in dividends and investment, both on a standalone basis and including Recall. On a standalone basis, the continued strong and durable cash of the base business, coupled with the Transformation Program, will at a minimum allow us to increase the dividend per share by 15% between 2015 and 2018, whilst reducing leverage by 0.4 of a turn. Including Recall, our minimum dividend per share delivers 24% growth between 2015 and 2018 and reduces leverage by 0.7 turns. This is all without issuing equity beyond the shares issued to purchase Recall. Now, turning to Q3 financial and operating highlights, total revenue for the quarter grew by 2% on a constant dollar basis, reflecting continued solid storage rental gains of 4.2%. The impact from foreign currency on total revenues was roughly 7%, reflecting the continued strong appreciation of the dollar against several of our major functional currencies. Moreover, we should note that we did not have any meaningful acquisition activity this quarter, as we deferred transactions to assess how they may be affected by the Recall acquisition. Having now fully assessed the benefit of the Recall acquisition, we have resumed M&A activity with an appropriately adjusted focus to account for Recall's footprint. This quarter, we continued to see good internal growth with storage rental up 2.8% for both the quarter and year-to-date, reflecting continued strong growth from Data Management, Other International and Western Europe. As we look at the remainder of the year, we are seeing consistent trends and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth in the mid-2% range. Looking at volume in Records Management, we added roughly 14 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 2.7% net growth. Globally, we retained 98% of all customers. This is in line with our second quarter and a 20% improvement from the customer turnover we experienced just two years ago. We continue to see the same number of boxes being inbounded, some 30 million cubic feet from our existing customers year after year, demonstrating the durability of the storage rental business. The durability of our business is demonstrated by solid growth in bookings we are seeing across major verticals. In addition, we encouraged by year-to-date low double-digit increase in the midmarket customer bookings, as we continue to increase our focus on these small to midsize enterprises where our market share of the total market is roughly 10%. We are pleased to report solid improvement in our service gross margins as a result of numerous initiatives. Q3 total service gross margin was 28.5%. However, when normalizing for the reclassification between storage and service, Q3 total service gross margins were approximately 26.8% and we are well on track to achieve our expected end-of-year run rate of between 27% and 27.5%. Now, let's turn to the Recall transaction. This deal is extremely compelling in terms of strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive significant accretion. With the benefit from a number of months of detailed and joint integration planning with our Recall counterparts, we remain comfortable with the estimated total net synergies of $155 million, with $110 million of that to be achieved in 2017. As we've noted in the past, there is potential upside to these figures as we work through real estate consolidation opportunities. We remain on track from a regulatory standpoint and we continue to target a close in early 2016. As I've said previously, our business is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income, which is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self storage sectors. What distinguishes our business is its inherent durability and it is this durability that delivers consistent levels of operating performance even in the most volatile times. With that, I'd like to turn the call over now to Rod.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Bill. We're pleased with this quarter's strong operating performance and the momentum we continue to see in our business. Our results continue to underscore the strength and durability of our storage rental business and the incremental returns we're generating from our investments. Similar to Bill, my remarks this morning will be brief. I'll begin with an overview of our quarterly and year-to-date performance, including a review of results by segments, and an update on cost related to the potential Recall transaction. Finally, I will touch briefly on our outlook for 2015 and 2016. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Referring to pages eight and nine of our supplemental, total reported revenues for the quarter was $747 million compared with $783 million in the prior year. This decline reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 6.6% or $50 million year-over-year. Excluding FX, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2%. Year-to-date reported revenues were $2.26 billion compared with $2.34 billion in 2014. And again, excluding FX, also grew by 2% on a constant dollar basis. Total revenues were driven by solid constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of more than 4% for the quarter and year-to-date. This was offset by modest service revenue declines of roughly 1.3% for the quarter and 1.1% year-to-date. The decline in our constant dollar service revenue is partially driven by the disposition of our shredding businesses in the UK and Australia. Consistent with prior quarters, we're providing bridging schedules for total revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share, which explain key variances in year-on-year performance. These schedules are on pages 20 through 22 of the supplemental. In addition, this quarter, we're providing a bridging schedule on page 23 to explain the change at our total service gross margin. In this schedule, we have normalized for the accounting adjustment that Bill referenced. And our projected year-end run rate of 27% to 27.5% is consistent with that normalized basis. Total adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $228 million compared to $235 million in 2014. Excluding FX, adjusted OIBDA was up 2.3%. Our adjusted OIBDA for Q3 2015 included $9 million of charges related to our Transformation program. Excluding these costs, adjusted OIBDA would have been $237 million or grown 6.5% on a normalized constant dollar basis. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA grew by 1.5% on a constant dollar basis. For the fourth quarter, we expect to incur very little in charges related to the Transformation product initiative. Please note that our savings outlook for Transformation remain consistent with what we laid out on our Investor Day. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.31 per diluted share compared with $0.35 in the third quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-on-year is driven by a 9% increase in share count related to the special distribution we made in Q4 2014, as well as the restructuring charges related to Transformation. Excluding the increase in share count and the Transformation costs, normalized adjusted EPS grew by 8.7% for the quarter. Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 16.5% compared with 16.3% for the prior quarter and 13.9% in Q2. The sequential increase in our structural tax rate was driven by the expenses related to the Recall acquisition and debt refinancing costs, which lowered our QRS pre-tax income. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% in the short-term. Our blended rate, following the close of the potential Recall acquisition, will be closer to 20%, as we noted when we announced the deal. Normalized funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.55 for the quarter and $1.53 year-to-date, while adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, was $137 million for the quarter and $395 million year-to-date. Let's turn to our financial performance by segments. In North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue showed a decline of 0.3% for the third quarter and is flat year-to-date. North American RIM internal storage rental growth can vary on a quarterly basis and is often impacted by the timing of large contract renegotiations. For the last eight quarters, it has varied from 0.9% to minus 0.4%. North American RIM internal service revenue declined this quarter due to continued decrease in retrieve/refile activity levels and the timing of non-recurring imaging projects that were in the year-ago period. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remained solid at 40% for the quarter and year-to-date. North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of more than 5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. However, internal service declined by 4.9% for the quarter and 4.1% year-to-date, as we continue to see declines in tape rotation and related transportation activity in the business. During the third quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA margins remained stronger at 51.6% compared with 50.8% in Q2. The Western Europe segment generated solid results with 1.4% storage rental internal growth for the quarter and 2.8% year-to-date. Looking at internal service revenue, declines in activity were partially offset by increases in non-recurring imaging and other projects. Adjusted OIBDA margins remained strong in Western Europe at 31.2%. The Other International segment, which is made up primarily of emerging markets and Australia, had strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.5% for the quarter and 11.4% year-to-date. Service internal growth was 12.3% for the quarter and 10.9% year-to-date. We continue to expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high teens and low 20%s range in the short-term, as we expand our exposure in these fast-growing markets. Let's touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we're making good progress with the regulatory process and we anticipate closing the deal early in 2016. To prepare for closing, this quarter, we incurred approximately $15 million of professional and advisory fees, including cost to prepare for Recall's REIT reconversion. We expect about $25 million to $30 million of additional Recall cost in the fourth quarter. Please note that these expenses are excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculations, as they are one-time in nature. Importantly, these costs were included in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal. As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 and 2016 remains consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this month at our Investor Day. But one exception to that is that we tightened our expected real estate investment range and lowered it by roughly $30 million at the midpoint relative to the projections provided at our Investor Day due to the focus on in timing of our real estate consolidation program. Given FX fluctuations and to provide better visibility of the underlying performance of our business, we're providing constant dollar guidance figures for 2016 and our plan is to continue that practice. Please note that our current 2016 guidance is based on 2015 constant dollar budget rates, which was set in January 2015. When we'll report full year 2015 results in February, we will provide an updated 2016 guidance based on 2016 constant dollar budget rates, which will be set in early January 2016. We've got the question from some of you on R$ guidance for 2016. Assuming constant September 30 FX rates, our exit FX impact for the quarter on total revenue, where approximately 40% of it denominated in non-U.S. dollars, is roughly 3.5%. Again, holding that constant for 2016, it implies a 3.5% FX impact on revenues, which translates into roughly $120 million impact for the full year. Beyond the dividend increase that Bill mentioned for the upcoming quarter, we laid out at our Investor Day minimum projected dividends per share guidance through 2018 on a standalone basis and the combined basis with Recall. Please refer to the presentation and webcast for more details. Late in September, we raised $1 billion of debt at 6%, enabling us to pay off some of our very high interest legacy debt and lowering our average interest costs. At the quarter end, we had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. Note that this figure is prior to the October 2015 redemption of our outstanding 6.75% euro notes and 7.75% U.S. notes and 8.375% U.S. notes. Following the redemption, liquidity will be approximately $900 million. Lastly, our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7 times as expected. Turning now to page 34 for supplemental where we highlight our investments for racking projects in process, building development and building acquisitions by major geographic region, the total expected investment and anticipated NOI and returns. Please note that these investments represent growth-related investments and exclude consolidated-related spend. As you can see on this page, we achieved high returns on our growth racking and building development projects. So far this year, our investment in M&A and real estate investment activity has been lower than typical as we prepare for the potential Recall acquisition. We are focusing future plans on the synergy potential fuelled by our real estate consolidation between the companies. Overall, we believe this was a solid quarter and we're pleased with the progress we have made so far in advancing our Transformation program and stabilizing service gross margins. We remain on track to deliver our guidance for 2015 as well as our long-term objectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, which drives our cash available to fund dividends and core growth investments. And with that, operator, we will now take questions.
Operator: The first question comes from Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Good morning.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Andy.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you for the details. I wanted to ask about the relationship between some of the organic volumes and the organic revenue growth rates in your two mature markets. It looks like in North American RIM organic revenue was minus 1.2%. The volumes were about flat; kind of a similar relationship in Western Europe where revenue was down 3.3%, but – I'm sorry, organic volumes were up over 3%, but total revenue was just on the positive side of flat. So, is there a pricing dynamic that's in there or is there something else going on? If you can give us some color around that relationship it would be helpful.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the – Andy, I think there's two aspects. One is the – one set of data, if we look at the price changes measured in revenue in terms of constant dollar storage, it's quarter-on-quarter. And when we look at volume, it's trailing 12 months. So, you can't quite put the two of them together. But if you kind of look at North America, North America is achieving similar types net volume growth organically, or before acquisitions, as we were last year. So, it's actually up in terms of volume. We've had some pricing adjustments this quarter due to some renewals, which I think we talked about a little bit on Investor Day. It's not unusual during certain times of the year. And if you go back over, say, the last two to three years, you'll see that we have maybe two, three, four quarters of positive internal storage revenue growth in North America and then it's punctuated by one or two quarters generally of negative, which is usually associated when we're doing renewals. But you can't – because one set of data, in terms if we look at the revenue side, is quarter-by-quarter, you can't link that to volume, which is just on trailing 12 months. I don't know, Rod, if you want to add anything to that.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, I think that's right. It's difficult to do the comparisons on a true like-for-like basis, as you said.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That makes total sense.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The only thing I would add, Andy, from a modeling standpoint, it's still what we've been saying consistently is that, so the volume – you can back out the volume increases that we're getting both in North America and in Europe. So that's easy. And then, in terms of the revenue increase, we still are achieving somewhere between 0.5% to 1% annual price increase in those markets. So, we're a little bit – we're starting to move a little bit more towards the upper part in that range through some of the technology we've added, but it's basically in that 0.5% to 1% on top of the volume growth that we're getting.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, Rod, with – after doing the October notes refi on to the line, the coordinates are a little bit tighter. Are you looking at tapping the unsecured market to term some of that debt out or is there complications with the pending Recall deal that we have to factor into your calculus here? Some of your thoughts on the capital structure would be helpful, I think.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. I think we're happy with the capital structure that we have at the moment, particularly having paid off the very high interest notes that we had. Effectively, what we'd like to do is hold what we have, see what happens through the Recall deal, which is to say we anticipate it to close in early Q1, but we're still working through the regulatory process there. It gives us some capital to assist with that on closure, if you like. But – so we're going to kind of hold what we've got and see how we get on with Recall.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thanks. Hey, nice job. Asking about Recall, but just one more time, because it'd probably be the last time before it closes. Bill, I know you're working through the regulatory, is it – are there any kind of goal post or anything that we should look out or is it just something you'll update once you're through the regulatory process? Because obviously something came out of the UK last week from the authorities, it looks like relatively benign. But is there any kind of disclosures you just think we should focus on as we get closer to the close process?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Kevin. I appreciate the question. I think if you can imagine that the regulators like these discussions to be kept confidential as we go through them. I think the – but I mean just to give you guidance, I think it's pretty much what we said at Investor Day is, we're engaged with the four regulatory authorities that have shown interest in the transaction, which is the U.S., Canada, the UK, as you mentioned, and Australia. We feel that we're well engaged with those authorities, so on track for a Q1 close and the discussions are ongoing. But where we sit today, we feel good that it's in line with our expectations when we set out on the course. So, nothing has changed. I mean, generally, these things take six months to 12 months, when you go through a regulatory process in the United States, for instance, but we continue to guide at the lower end of that range because we feel good where we stand.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. And then, as you think about the progression, kind of the volume growth, I've always thought that you'd start to see destructions and permanent removal start to kind of trail off, and then new volume growth, I mean, just the customers kicks up. Does that kind of ratio still hold through as we're coming out of this kind of cycle in terms of things we look forward, as a volume growth starts to reaccelerate here?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, look, you're right. I mean you've watched this for a long time. There's ebbs and flows. I'm not sure you can always do the cause and effect between perm-outs (29:07) and destructions, but – and customer withdrawals, but I think the – there is ebb and flow between the two. And the other thing I should point out is the new sales growth is, it's part art and part science, because some of that new sales growth comes from existing customers. And that split between new sales growth and what comes from "existing customers" is much to do in terms of the way we compensate our sales force. In other words, if they get something – if they get some growth out of an existing customer, but we deemed it as a new area or new location or new department, then we call that a new sale. So I think there is some ebb and flow between the two. And as you know, if we look at the heavily regulated industries, which we have a – which is a big part of our business, is a lot of that's affected by different litigation that's going on around the world. So I think there is some cause and effects, but I wouldn't overplay it. There's a certain amount of randomness to it.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Cool. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from George Tong of Piper Jaffray.
Adrian S. Paz - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi. This is Adrian Paz on for George Tong. Just looking at your updated guidance, it seems like there's a slightly better OIBDA margins at the midpoint versus last quarter. Can you discuss what is making you incrementally more positive on margins?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I'll let Rod answer that. I think just on a high level, there's a couple things. I think one is if you even look over time, we're pretty good at driving productivity out of the business. Because when you start off, what I was saying earlier is that, we get – currently, in this low inflation environment, we get somewhere between 0.5% to 1% increase in price. Obviously, our labor cost in certain markets goes up faster than that. So, we continually drive productivity through the business. And that's what really drives our OIBDA growth. And then, I think you can expect also when some of the transformation gets fully realized, now that we're through most of the restructuring cost in this quarter, you could expect that that will even pick up a little bit more. But, Rod, you may want to comment further.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, maybe just to build on what you're saying, you're absolutely right in terms of the point that was made. If you look at our guidance – take the C$ guidance that we updated at Investor Day, in effect what we're saying is that from a revenue point of view, we see ourselves at the middle of the range, and contribution, we see ourselves more towards the higher point of the range. And obviously, therefore the OIBDA margin goes up. Really, what's behind that is the work that we've been doing on efficiencies around service margin and also around the Transformation efforts that we've referenced. Some of that has come through in 2015 faster than we originally anticipated when we set the guidance back in January. And really, that's what's behind the improvement we're seeing.
Adrian S. Paz - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Got it. Thanks. And then, can you just discuss which emerging markets are showing the strongest growth and if that growth reflects expansion in those markets or it's increasing volumes?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think on the emerging markets, we're seeing it pretty much across the board, but it depends on the size of the base. So, for instance, I just came back from Eastern Europe and took couple of members of the board along with me so they could see up close what we're doing out there and also see some of the talent we've got. So, Eastern Europe is growing – continues to grow extremely well so does in Latin America. I mean, the challenge in Latin America, Brazil, which is our largest operation, for instance, is in terms of growth. And if you measure it in Brazilian real, it is strongly double-digit and continues to do well. I mean, the issue, of course, in places like Brazil is the translation of that because the real's been under pressure. And then Asia, which is a smaller portion of our portfolio, but again has very strong growth rates, whether you look at India, or you look at places like Hong Kong, Singapore and China. The one thing I would point out, though, is that in markets – even in markets like Brazil, where we've been under pressure from a real standpoint, so when you translate that in U.S. dollars, the growth may be muted slightly, is we've also been able – in some of these cases like Brazil, been able to borrow locally in real, which has helped to hedge some of that translation. But I would say pretty much across the board. We haven't seen any slowdown in the emerging markets and all the countries typically run in that low double-digit of internal growth before acquisitions.
Adrian S. Paz - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, there. I know there's a couple of questions already on FX, but if it's possible, Rod, could you just give us the mix of currencies, so we could those calculations ourselves, the mix of currencies?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, really, obviously, we deal in quite a number of currencies in terms of what's impacting our numbers. And I think in terms of the short-term impact, the – where we've seen the hit is being Canadian dollar, Russian ruble, Aussie dollar, the Brazilian real and Colombian peso. So they've been hitting us during Q3. If you were to take a longer term view, so more looking year-on-year, there sort of wider effects coming in from sterling in particular, where obviously also we have quite a significant business.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The only thing I'd like to add to that, Andrew, is that, whilst you've seen the FX headwinds in revenue, you'll note that it gets muted pretty quickly as we start going through the OIBDA and the EPS line. And the – where we are at a stage is, in some sense the timing is not bad for us because we are using strong U.S. dollars to invest and build out this portfolio, which is still a relatively small portion in terms of the countries where the currency is mostly impacted, which is in the emerging markets. I'm not saying that the other markets aren't a factor. So, if you say 40% of our sales are in foreign currency, but the currencies that are impacted typically are in that, a little less than 15% emerging market area. And those are areas where our OIBDA margins at this point are lower because we're building scale in those markets. So we're taking strong U.S. dollars to build out these markets right now. And their impact – even with the negative FX impact, the impact on OIBDA in earnings is muted. It's obviously fully affected at the revenue line, but when you see what happens to earnings, it's muted. So, I agree you need to model it out, but the earnings is not as sensitive as you might think to the FX, whereas you do see the full sensitivity on the revenue line. That's why we feel comfortable about already starting to increase our dividend because we feel that we've got enough momentum in the business that we can continue and start back on our growth trend in terms of dividends.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That sounds natural (36:27). I'm hoping I could ask a second question. Could you, Rod, talk a little bit more about the OIBDA margin of 30.5% in the third quarter? Were there any one-off helps to that margin? And what puts and takes should we keep in mind as we compare the third quarter OIBDA margins to the implied fourth quarter margin in the guide?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, nothing particularly unusual in Q3. Obviously, other than the fact, we actually booked the $9 million restructuring charge, which actually lowered the margin slightly. I think as we look to Q4, again, sitting here today, I'm not seeing anything particularly unusual that should come through. Obviously, we won't have a repeat of the $9 million charge and there would be some benefit from that actually hitting us in Q4 as a result of the slightly lower cost base. But other than that, I think it's pretty much steady as she goes.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I'm just trying to compare the storage revenue that was in North American RIM that was slightly negative versus the trends that we're seeing in the charts where you have positive volume growth. And the positive volume growth, if you exclude the acquisitions, has been kind of modestly creeping downwards, but you still got positive growth, but we're seeing kind of negative revenue on an organic basis. Can you kind of just explain that?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Shlomo, let me start off and then Rod can add any color that he thinks that I missed out. So I think, first, let's look at the revenue growth. So if you go back, say, to Q4 2013, right, and you just look at the number of quarters, you'll see that North American storage rental revenue growth has gone negative 0.4%, negative 0.3%, plus 0.3%, plus 0.4%, plus 0.9%, plus 0.5%, and then in the last two quarters a negative 0.1% and negative 0.3%. So you'll see, first of all, which I was referring to earlier, you'll see that moving around and you can kind of get that – you can back into that through the supplemental. And so, on the revenue side, because as you can appreciate when we renegotiate large enterprise deals that you do get – in any given quarter, you can get a significant impact in terms of the revenue associated per cube. So there's a disconnect between that volume growth. Over a long period of time, though – if you look at the trend over a long period of time, we still see, if you take the revenue growth and if you look on an annualized basis, we're getting between 0.5% and 1% in terms of price per cube growth, then you get those two bits combined and that will give you a good guide in terms of what the internal storage revenue growth is for a particular market. So, the – you're right to point out that we continue to drive significant – I'd say on a percentage basis relatively small percentage growth in North America, but in terms of volume, because of the size of the North American business, as you know, the law of large numbers, we continue to deliver a significant amount of organic cube volume growth in North America. And over a 12-month period, you should think about 0.5% to 1% price growth on top of that cube growth. But any given quarter, depending on where we are in renewal cycle, especially for the large contracts, if you go back over the last, I don't know, eight quarters, nine quarters, 10 quarters, you'll see that movement around where we'll have one or two quarters where it'll be negative, two quarters or three quarters will be positive and it just kind of moves around.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So just when I look at the trends on the volume growth, so if you take the total company and then North America, which probably is having the largest impact, you're seeing just kind of a modest organic trend down over the last four quarters, if you – I'm excluding acquired volume, because I think that that's appropriate for this. But if you look at it, you're seeing the organic, say, going from 0.6% – in North America, 0.6%, 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.1% and on total you're going 2%, 1.9%, 1.8%, 1.7%, is there – we had seen kind of a run up, that whole organic number had been going – trending up from the middle of 2013 through basically 3Q 2014 and then we're starting to see that coming down. Is there any color you can give to that, those numbers moving in that direction?
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, look, I think that it's a little bit is what I think Kevin asked earlier in terms of kind of tos-and-fros between customer cycles, there's a bit of that. I think, also, it's fair to say on a percentage basis, it is coming down slightly because, I mean, partly driven by customer activity, but a big part of it is just the large number. So if you look at the constant – if you look at the volume of cubes coming in, we're still seeing very consistently across the board 30 million cubes coming in on a growth level and, say, 40 million cubes net coming in. I think the one of the things that we do where you'll see us try to even tap into another market, which we think is quite large, is what we're doing in the mid-market. So I think if you look at where we are on the mid-market side, I think I actually misquoted is we're in kind of low double-digit growth, if we look at year-on-year bookings for new sales across the board. But in the mid-market, year-to-date, we're up over 60% in terms of bookings in the mid-market where we only have 10% market share. So I think there's some things where we can tap into "another large market", but I think it is fair to say that if you look at our core, our normal hunting ground, if you will, it's the law of large numbers and there is a limit in terms of how much more we can get from those customers.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, that's fair. And can you – Rod, can you just explain that reallocation of margin between the services and the storage business, what is that all about?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It was actually to do with our – predominantly to do with our data center business where we had some costs that were in the service line that we really analyze where (42:53) we thought they should be in the storage line. So that sort of artificially enhanced the service margin in Q3. So we didn't want to give the impression that we were – the true underlying run rate was 28.5%, which is what we recorded, that is more like 26%, 26.8%. So that – it was just a reallocation of cost following a more detailed reviewing.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Does that support the REIT structure when those were reallocated like that?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: In that case, it has a very, very minor impact, but – so it doesn't affect our assets as such (43:31) in any meaningful way.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. If I could just squeeze in one more, there's a pretty large range at the end of the year right now, $0.15 on EPS. Is there any reason why it's so large or is there something that you're anticipating some investments that you're still contemplating at this point in time that can move it around?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No. And obviously, we are subject to FX volatility, which during Q3 moved against us. Actually, if you look during the first few weeks of October, it's moved slightly back in our favor. So that can swing the numbers around. But in terms of the fundamentals of the business, it's relatively stable.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: There are no questions in queue.
William Leo Meaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you, operator. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us. I know it's a busy time for everyone, but just to sum up. We're very pleased the way the quarter came out. It was a very good quarter driven by the strong – or continued strong operating performance I should say and has delivered profit that set the upper end of our expectations. So we feel really good about the quarter and hence the recommencing of our dividend increases that we declared this morning. So, thank you, everyone, and have a good day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes call. You may now disconnect.

Executives: Melissa Marsden – Senior Vice President, Investor Relations Bill Meaney – President and Chief Executive Officer Rod Day – Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Kevin McVeigh – Macquarie Andy Wittman – Baird George Tong – Piper Jaffray Andrew Steinerman – JP Morgan Dan Dolev – Jefferies Shlomo Rosenbaum – Stifel
Operator: Good morning. My name is Keyva, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q2 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now like to hand the call over to, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Melissa Marsden. Please go ahead, Ma’am.
Melissa Marsden: Thank you, Keyva and good morning, everyone. This morning we’ll begin our call with remarks from Bill Meaney, our President and CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and progress towards our strategic initiatives followed by Rod Day, our CFO, who will cover financial and operating results. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. As we have done for the last few quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com under Investor Relations/Financial Information. Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and supplemental package do contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2015 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today’s supplemental the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. And the reconciliations to those measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
Bill Meaney: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We’re pleased to be reporting solid second quarter results that we’re in line with our expectations on a constant currency basis and underscore the durability of our core business. Despite the FX headwinds, we’re comfortable maintaining our guidance our for 2015 as we typically see a bit of a ramp in the second half of the year. It was a very eventful quarter with the announcement of our agreement to acquire Recall Holdings and the initiation of our transformation plan, which will drive significant improvement in our overhead cost structure and support strong cash flow generation in years to come, even prior to the substantial and additional synergies we anticipate from our acquisition of Recall. I’ll get to the last two items shortly, but first I would like briefly cover certain financial and operating highlights. Our momentum in the storage rental business continues to build and drive durable results in line with our strategic plan. On a constant dollar basis, total revenue growth for the quarter was 2.2% reflecting continued solid storage rental gains of 4.1% and service revenue declines of just 0.6%, foreign currency impact year-over-year in total revenue by roughly 6%, reflecting the strong appreciation of the dollar experiences at this time in 2014. We also continued to see good internal growth with storage rental, up 2.7% for the quarter and 2.9% for the year-to-date reflecting continued strong growth from data management or DM and the other international segment and stable performance in Western Europe and North America rim. As we look at the remainder of the year, we are seeing consistent trends and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth for 2015 in the mid 2% range. The realignment of our data management business we initiated last year is yielding good result. DM storage continue to show very strong internal growth with 5.3% increase over last year. Total service revenue internal growth was flat for the quarter and down just 0.5 point year-to-date in line with our expectations for continued yet moderating top line headwinds. Looking at volume in records management, we added roughly 14 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12 months basis, representing 2.8% net growth. This growth was maintained in part as a result of the significant turnaround we are continuing to achieve in North America from negative to positive internal volume growth or in other words before benefit from acquisitions. Net volume growth in North America was 1.2% or 0.4% on an internal basis excluding acquisitions in line with Q1 levels. Globally we maintain customer retention of 98% in line with the first quarter and a 20% improvement over the level of customer turnover experienced just two years ago. Now turning to our transformation overhead optimization program we announced in June prior to the Recall acquisition news. We’ve spoken with many of you about this over the past several weeks and highlighted our reorganization in April in which we put a single leader over our developed market has facilitated this important program. This initiative calls for taking $100 million out of overhead costs or SG&A between now and 2018 in this independent of and additive to the Recall acquisition. This will bring us from our current overhead of more than 28% of total revenue down to the mid 20% range, and more in keeping with best practices for companies with similar size in global reach. Importantly, we have already implemented a portion of this program and achieved $50 million of cost reduction or half of these savings with a charge to be taken in Q3 and the full benefit of the $50 million to be realized in 2016. With a partial year contribution from this program we expect the net impact for 2015 to be neutral. Also in recent communications we’ve illustrated how the decline in our service margins over the past few years and more recently FX headwinds have offset the attractive returns we achieved from investment in real estate in acquisitions. In fact, during this period we have been achieving unlevered returns on invested growth capital in the low teens and have seen significant contribution flow through in the past couple of years. We initiated some programs last year and are continuing to implement changes that we believe will allow us to stabilize the service margin trend line and get back to around 27% by the end of the year. It is important to keep this in perspective. While service represents 40% of our total revenue, today it represents just 17% of our total gross profit. Again to be clear, we are talking about a slowdown in the activity of physical records and tapes being retrieved, not a slowdown in incoming volume of records and tapes to be stored. Whilst demand for typical office cut sheet paper has declined between 2% and 4% in the mature markets, in the past few years, we continue to see the same number of boxes being inbounded from our existing customer year-after-year, demonstrating the durability of the storage rental business. We do continue to expect service revenue headwinds of negative 1% to negative 2% annually over the next few years and in fact we did see flat service revenue this quarter compared to a year ago period. And whiles we can’t completely offset the impact of lower service revenues due to a decline in retrieval and re-file in transportation activity, we can do more to align our service cost structure with this decrease in activity levels. So what are we doing to address this service margin decline? First we are looking at ways to variabilized more of our cost. Second, we are exploring efforts to make more efficient use of third party logistic suppliers or 3PL where we can be assured they will maintain our quality and focus on secured chain of custody. We have used this in Europe on a smaller scale and believe we can expand the use of 3PL elsewhere. And third, we are using technology more proactively such as using sensors to detect when shred bins are ready – are ready to be emptied to make roots more efficient. Additionally, in this quarter we have seen an uptick in our bad debt. This has come out of our North American business and is primarily the result of refining our billing process over the past 18 months to 24 months. During this transition we didn’t adequately refine the process before moving responsibility for the North American billing offshore. Here is now our robust plan in place addressing this. Now let’s turn to the Recall transaction. This deal is extremely compelling in terms of industrial logic and strategic fit and is supported by meaningful synergies that drive significant accretion. I assume by now you are familiar with the basic terms of the deal, so I won’t review all the information but rather just touch upon the highlights. In the announcement presentation, we illustrate estimated total net synergies of $155 million with $110 million of that to be achieved by 2017. These synergies are driven by economies of scale from the combination of infrastructure and overhead, and when fully realized, will lead to double-digit accretion in adjusted EPS, FFO per share, and AFFO. At 25% of our size, Recall is managing a similar global platform in terms of country coverage as they are in 24 countries, compared to our 36 which drives much of the overhead synergies. Another benefit of the proposed transaction in the medium term is that it supports our deleveraging strategy. With the additional cash available to us from our transformation plan as well as recall synergies, we can not only fund a stable and growing dividend per share, but we also generate the capital we need for growth. Additionally, we have complementary market platforms with Recall having a more developed presence in the small-to-medium businesses whilst we have significant presence with the larger enterprise customers. We’ve been on the road over the past several weeks and have met with a number of our shareholders, as well as recalled major holders in Australia. And what we’re hearing is universal agreement that our two companies are worth more together than they are separately. You can see that several Recall shareholders have increased their holdings and appreciate the attractiveness of owing the combined company. Even our most seasoned devices have noted that they cannot remember a deal that delivered 26% EPS accretion in three years time. In the next several weeks we expect to file the shareholder meeting document, seeking approval of the acquisition, which will have additional detail, including proforma results. Turning back Iron Mountain, on past calls we discussed progress on our three-year strategic plan which rests on three pillars, getting more from our developed markets, expanding our presence in faster-growing emerging markets and continued to explore adjacent opportunities in our emerging business segment. Whilst the Recall acquisition and transformation plan have guarded a bit more internal and external attention of late, we continued to make good progress on our base plan, achieving consistent positive storage volume growth in developed markets in completing an organizational realignment to put developed markets under common leadership, which enables our ability to implement our latest transformation program as well as to accelerate our service margin initiatives. Additionally, in emerging markets, we continued to progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from these markets by the end of next year. We pressed the pause button on acquisition for a moment to assess some of the transactions in the pipeline, might be affected by the Recall acquisition, but we are resuming activity and continue to be pleased with the quality, size and scope of our pipeline. We’ve also discussed on recent calls how we have been impacted by the effects of currency, translation in terms of absolute earnings and cash impact in U.S. dollars. While FX variability does impact the absolute dollars we report, the impact on our gross and adjusted OIBDA margins is muted because most of our expenses are denominated in local currency, thereby creating a natural hedge. On the other hand, we continue to believe that the current strong dollars – positive in terms of investments opportunity. Given our intend to expand what is today, a relatively small international base, we believe we can create significant value over time by investing selectively in these higher growth markets using strong U.S. dollars during this part of the currency cycle. This may take the form of M&A, or in the purchase or development of real estate. In both cases, we can benefit from investing at a low basis. In addition, we have deepened our focus in the real estate investment area, adding an experienced REIT asset manager to accelerate our plan to buy $700 million to $1 billion of our leased facilities over the next eight years to ten years. As we seek to shift our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties, on average, we are achieving a spread of roughly 150 basis points between our going-in cap rates and our market cap rates, whilst positioning ourselves to capture long-term residual value from ownership. We think this is important and appropriate as a REIT, as it supports such being viewed more in line with traditional REITs by the rating agencies and investors. Importantly, our debt to total market cap and our debt to EBITDA measures, are in line with major REIT sector leaders [ph] and our internal storage rental revenue fared better than these sectors during the recent recession. When we did not have a down year. Our low volatility business is distinguished by a track record of 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue. As we think about the opportunities to grow our storage rental business it is important not to lose sight of the durability of the business which is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income from our storage business alone. This amount of NOI is comparable to that generated by leaders in both the industrial and self-storage sectors. As we noticed in recent calls, the restructure is consistent with our capital allocation goals; it does not limit our ability to fund our business plan as we become more active in buying in our properties and executing on our acquisition pipeline. We expect to fund that incremental investment with excess cash flow or additional borrowing. Now I would like to turn the call over to Rod.
Rod Day: Thanks Bill. Our results continued to demonstrate that durability of our storage rental revenue stream and the underlying strength of our business fundamentals. Our performance is tracking in line with our full-year expectations. To frame my remarks, I'll begin today with an overview of our second quarter and year-to-date performance, including overview of results by segments. Then I will address plans and expectations related to our transformation program and our next step to improve service gross margins. I will briefly touch on the recall acquisition calls and also our outlook for 2015, which remains unchanged since June on the constant dollar basis. Finally, I will address other metrics through a REIT lens. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results. Referring now to pages eight and nine of our supplemental, total reported revenue was $760 million, compared with $787 million in Q2 of 2014 down, by 3.5% year-over-year. This reflects the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 5.7% or $44 million. Excluding FX and so on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew by 2.2%. Year-to-date reported revenues were $1.51 billion, compared with $1.56 billion in 2014. Again on a constant dollar basis, first half total revenue growth was also 2.2%. Worldwide revenues were driven by solid constant dollar storage rental revenue growth of 4.1% for the quarter and 4.63% year-to-date. This was offset by service revenue declines of roughly 1% for the quarter and year-to-date. As we did for the prior quarter, we are providing bridging schedules for revenue, OIBDA and earnings which explain key variances in year-on-year performance. These were on Pages 20 to 22 supplemental. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $223 million compared with $242 million in 2014, down 7.7% on a reported basis and 3.3% on a constant dollar basis. The constant dollar adjusted OIBDA decline was driven by investments in new product introductions for example in data management. In addition, we had a $4 million increase in bad debt expense. As Bill mentioned, during the offshoring of our billing activities, our collection efforts fell behind. However, we now have a strong remediation in place. Service margin declines were further drive on the business although these were offset by improvements in storage contribution. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 per diluted share, compared with $0.41 in the second quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-over-year is driven by 10% increase in share count related to the special distribution, which we made in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition to the earlier OIBDA write-down, adjusted EPS was also impacted by an increase in interest expense related to higher levels of debt. As stated in our earlier calls, this year-over-year increase in borrowings was driven primarily by REIT conversion related expenses, such as E&P purge and the depreciation amortization recapture payments. On the subject to debt, please note that it’s our instance to refinance our high coupon debt when conditions allow. Our structural tax rate for this quarter came out to 13.9% compared with 15% in the prior quarter, primarily as result of mix change in income from foreign jurisdictions. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the long-term. Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share $0.48 for the quarter, $0.98 year-to-date, while adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $130 million for the quarter and $255 million year-to-date. Let me now turn to Records Management volume trends on Pages 10 and 11. As you can see, we achieved positive volume growth of 1.2% in North America, 3% in Western Europe and 9.7% in the other international segment, delivering global records management net volume growth of 2.8%. We continued to experience strong organic growth with second quarter total year-on-year volume growth of 1.8% excluding acquisitions. Underlying this growth is the stable incoming volume from existing customers. We continued to add approximately 30 million gross cubic foot of storage in the last 12 months, consistent with prior periods. Let's now turn to our financial performance by segments. In North American records management and information, or RIM, internal storage rental revenue was flat for the second quarter. Year-to-date North American RIM internal storage rental revenue grew by 0.2%. Internal service revenue growth showed a small improvement in Q2 with a decline of 1.3%, compared with decline of 1.8% in Q1. Adjusted OIBDA margins in RIM remain solid at 39.4% for the quarter and 40.2% year-to-date. North American Data Management delivered storage rental internal growth of 5.3% in both the second quarter and year-to-date. However, service declined by 1.7% for the quarter and 3.8% year-to-date. As we continue to see declines in re-file and transportation activity. During the second quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA declined to 50.8% from 52.7% in Q1, as we continued to invest in new products. The Western Europe segment generated solid results with 3.5% storage rental internal growth for the quarter and 3.6% year-to-date. This growth was partially offset by declines in internal service revenue, 4.8% for the quarter and 3.7% year-to-date. The decline in service revenue was driven mostly by the sale of our shred business in the UK and Ireland was at the end of last year. Adjusted OIBDA margins declined in Western Europe this quarter due to legal cost related to a customer dispute. The other international segments, which is made up of emerging markets in Australia built strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.5% for the quarter and 11.3% year-to-date. Service internal growth was 13.5% for the quarter and 10.2% year-to-date. This quarter emerging market revenues represented approximately 14% of our total revenues on a constant dollar basis. We expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high-teens to low 20s range. We continue to expand our exposure in these fast growing markets. As Bill mentioned, we are leveraging our new leadership structure to focus on integrating across – cost developed markets. Rail transformation program which was announced last month we expect to achieve approximately $100 million production in overhead expense by 2018. Actions we have taken this month are expected to yield a full year $50 million benefits in 2016. We will see partial benefits this year at the end of the year. However, these will be offset by severance related charges. We are anticipating approximately $10 million of severance related expenses in the third quarter as a result of this program. Let’s now discuss our initiative to maintain and enhance service gross margins. As Bill outlined, decline in service gross margin [indiscernible] as a drag on our performance in the last four years. [Indiscernible] the strong returns that we’re seeing from investments in real estate and M&A. That said, it should also be remember that on a constant dollar basis, we have seen good improvements in overall contribution year-on-year in 2014 and we expect the same in 2015. As discussed earlier and as you can see in the supplemental on Page 26, in the second quarter, service gross margins have declined year-over-year. The actions we are now taking are not yet reflected in our results. In the second half of the year, we expect to see an improvement in service margins that continues to targets a year end run rate of about 27%. Let’s touch on the Recall acquisition briefly. As Bill mentioned, we’re making good progress with regulatory filings. To prepare for closing we incurred approximately $6 million professional and advisory fees this quarter. We expect about $10 million to $15 million of additional spend in each of the third and fourth quarters of this year. In addition to these advisory fees we’re expecting approximately $20 million to $25 million charge in the second half of the year to prepare for integration, including Recall’s reconversion. Please note that these costs will be excluded from our adjusted OIBDA calculation, as they are one-time in nature. These costs are also included in our guidance related to the Recall acquisition when we announced the deal. As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 remains consistent with the guidance we provided in June, when we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Recall. Please note that at this time our guidance doesn’t reflect the benefit or impact of potential Recall transaction. We’ll provide detailed guidance for 2016 and beyond at our upcoming Investor Day in October. For 2015 although we expect revenue to be as anticipated on a constant dollar basis for the full year, given FX movements, we expect reported dollar revenues to be towards the lower end of our range. As regard to other metrics for both constant and reported dollars, we expect them to be well within our ranges. Our strong cash flow continues to support our dividend at current levels within 2015. And we intend to maintain our dividend per share rates for the reminder of the year, subject to Board approval. Our estimate for cash available for distribution and discretionary investment for 2015 remains, $470 million, giving us ample dividend coverage and the ability to fund our core real estate investments or bow cracking, which support approximately 2% organic growth in our adjusted OIBDA. 2016 and beyond, assuming the Recall acquisition closes and with the transformation benefits, we have excess cash that can support potential growth in the dividend and fund discretionary investments in real estate, M&A, or emerging business opportunities. These investments achieved returns of [indiscernible] and are accreted to shareholders. To sum up, we have adequate dividend coverage, excess capacity and attractive investment options. Shifting to the balance sheet, at the quarter end we have liquidity of approximately $750 million. At quarter end, our lease adjusted debt ratio was 5.7 times as expected. Turning now to REIT specific metrics. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI approximately $28 per racked square foot worldwide, which compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector. Our racking and building utilization rates are high at 91% and 84% respectively for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90%s. When we enter a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about three years' time. Investment page, Page 32, the supplemental, highlights our investments for racking projects in process, building development and building acquisitions by major geographic region, their total expected investment and anticipated NOI and returns. Please note that these investments represent growth related investments and exclude consolidation related expense. As you can see on this page, we achieved high returns in our growth racking and building development projects. Lastly, similar to prior quarters, we are providing components of value, a summary of various metrics of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether facilities are leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. Overall, we believe this is a solid quarter and we’re pleased with the momentum we continue to see in the business. We remain on track to deliver our guidance for 2015. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on enhancing shareholder value by extending the durability of our storage rental business, improving service margins, achieving overhead cost reductions through our Transformation Program and realizing the synergy benefits of the Recall acquisition. Now that concludes my summary for the Q2 financials.
Bill Meaney: Okay, thank you Rod. Before we turn to Q&A, just to wrap up, I just want to emphasize a few things. That first of all, we have a number of exciting developments underway. We have already executed on half of our plan for significant cost reduction of more than a $100 million and we will see the full benefits of the first $50 million for 2016. We have actions underway, that we expect will stabilize the margins in our service business. We are keying up to close the Recall deal early next year and are organized internally to support a smooth integration of Recall. And our attractive emerging business pipeline is delivering interesting adjacencies that can further extend the durability of our enterprise storage business. Finally and most importantly, the strength of our business, plus the transformation program support approximately 11% to 14% growth in the cash we have available already next year to grow our dividend per share over time and fund our growth investment. This is even prior to the Recall acquisition. With that operator, we are ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thanks. Bill, very helpful comment, or there any type of goal post you can give us in terms of cadence on Recall, I know there’s a process involved in any [indiscernible] so on and so forth. But is there anything, you could point to that we kind codage [ph] give us cadence as the deal progresses over the course of the year?
Bill Meaney: Hi, good morning, Kevin thanks. Well, I think the same goal post that we set on the beginning is that we started the regulatory review process, rent engaging the regulatory review process and that’s a six to 12 months process. We feel that we should be able to do it at the lower end of that range. So our expectation is still the first quarter for 2016 and the net – we will continue to update that changes, but I think right now that’s our expectation. I think the other goal post as we said on this call within the next few weeks both us and Recall will be issuing documents for their respective shareholders for the – get ready for the shareholder votes. But those are probably just two goal posts that are important to highlight.
Kevin McVeigh: And then just the $20 million to $25 million of Recall we conversion costs is that something about right, does that mean it’s a dual track in terms of you start that reconversion process now. So when the deal occurs, it was goes lot of day one?
Bill Meaney: Yeah, well, I think, that the – it’s a very good point. Yes, we will start incurring cost and Rod can give you more detail on that. We’ll start incurring cost as we speak now in preparing for the REIT conversion, because we need to convert before the close of the first quarter. So you’ll also note us in the documentation is, that we have set it up the documentation that we will close at the beginning of a quarter. So the idea is that we will close either at the beginning of the first quarter, or either – the first month of the first quarter, i.e. around the month of January or it would be beginning of the month of the second quarter, again to give us time to actually execute the conversion. But the prep for that conversion obviously starts way in advance of closing the transaction, I don’t know Rod, if you want to add any?
Rod Day: Yeah, I think, that’s a good summary, Bill. Kevin I can’t exactly tell you when but it is by the end of the first quarter and obviously given the limited amount of time that we have, it’s important we get our preparation right in advance of that. So it’s really worth spend is primarily related to.
Bill Meaney: And you’ll see that in the documentation on the deal is that it’s very clearly set out that if we miss roughly the first say four or five weeks of a quarter then it’s been a delay for the next quarter because again we have to get the conversions done during that period.
Kevin McVeigh: Got it. And then – and this will be my last question, I apologize. Would there be any incremental tax expense like [indiscernible] step up from the racking on the initial conversion or that $20 million to $25 million had primarily professional fees things like that?
Bill Meaney: Yeah, that relates primarily to professional fees.
Kevin McVeigh: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Andy Wittman of Baird.
Andy Wittman: Hi, good morning guys. Bill I had kind of a strategic question. We’ve seen some consolidation in the shredding industry. You guys have kind of aided that as you got all of your European shredding. I was wondering as you look at your business today, particularly as a REIT, does even more disposition of the shredding assets make sense for you, particularly if you could find a partner that would be able to do this with. Let me something, you’d be open to considering or our considering today.
Bill Meaney: Well, I think first of all just from a general capital allocation standpoint we look at all our businesses and say, we the best owner for that or is that where we should invest capital. So we look across all our businesses. So to say that we are open to certain segments and non-open to others would be probably a false premise. But I mean we like you look with interest in terms of what seems to be happening in the shredding business. We feel good in terms of what we’ve done over the last six, 12 months in terms of first of all divesting those shredding operations the one in Australia, the one in the UK, where we didn’t think we have to scale, we get the kind of returns that we expect in demand. Well, separating the U.S. operation to be more of a standalone unit so that it has the right focus and cadence associated with it to achieve the results that we think are possible. So I think we feel comfortable where we are, but we were also very pleased in terms of the way the market seems to be valuing these assets, whether we own them or we sell them.
Andy Wittman: Yeah, okay, good, that’s helpful. And then, I guess I wanted to gain a little bit more in the transformation business. Can you give us a little bit more detail about what some of those, maybe some confidence that they are not going to affect but the customer experience and your retention rates are rather business drivers.
Bill Meaney: It’s – excellent question. So I think first of all, we need to start the top that we are starting from a base, where our SG&A is 28% of sales, which is clearly on the upper end of what our company with our scale and scope should be able to achieve. It should – company of our scale and scope should be in the, let’s say the mid-20s, I mean, probably the lower side of the mid-20s, in other words, not – it’s probably kind of more of the 23% to 25% ranges where a company of our size and complexity should be. So that’s the first thing to give you kind of a sense of what’s possible. Then the thing that triggers it is, this – really if you think about it, there are I would say three buckets. One is just getting efficiency through the reorganizations that when we put all the developed markets under 1% then it allows you to rationalize. You know you have two finance groups, you have two HR groups, you have two commercial leadership groups, you have two engineering groups et cetera. So you’re able to actually shrink that to one to get some of the efficiencies and economics of scale that you would expect. I think the second aspect of it is looking at what we call just general spans and layers, probably it’s triggered by that move by just saying, what is the right breadth of responsibility in the organization. Do we have too many layers? And I think that’s just good housekeeping that all companies our size need to go through every so often to make sure that we don’t have what I would call organizational tree or layers building into the organization and to me that’s important not just from a cost standpoint but it also important from a dynamic standpoint, I mean, by dynamic is to be quicker, nimble, more nimble, less bureaucratic. So I think that’s a – its shows up in the cost line but we also expect that to show up in the revenue line. And then the third aspect is it’s related a little bit to the aging of some of our aging of our receivable split which lead to a bad debt charge, is that we need to look at our processes first and foremost in terms how can we make those more efficient and then where should those be done, should they be done internally, should they be done internally offshore or should they be done by an outside party. And that’s the third bucket that we are going through both optimized those processes. And then figure out where they should be done either within Iron Mountain or by an outside vendor. And that’s kind of that the three buckets that we’re going through. Now at last when you can imagine we are actually using also some outside help that have done this a number times. So we feel very confident in terms of the targets and we feel very confident that we are doing this in area that doesn’t impact the customer experience and service levels and in fact, I think, our expectation is it should improve, as we look to make the organization quicker, more nimble and less bureaucratic.
Rod Day: Yeah I mean, I’ll just add to that, Bill, I think if you benchmark are announced and against comparable type companies, I think, you can say we are behind where we should be on some of the stock. And that gives us confidence around the program that we have. So things like offshoring, we’ve done some of that, but nowhere near enough we have done some process improvement but nowhere near enough. There has been some improvement in our SG&A and as a percent of revenue over the last couple of years. But again if you look at benchmarks, if it is median benchmarks, represents 25%, Bill you know you compare that to where we are obviously. And again I think that gives us additional confidence to what we’re trying to do is now rocket science it’s just what we should be doing.
Andy Wittman: Yes, okay. I’ll leave it with that. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from the line of George Tong of Piper Jaffray.
George Tong: Hi, good morning.
Bill Meaney: Good morning, George.
George Tong: You’ve talked a bit about various puts and takes in OIBDA margin performance in the quarter and some of it appear to be transient in nature. Can you frame up how you think about OIBDA margin on a go forward basis? And any plan in reinvestments of the benefits you expect from the transformation program?
Bill Meaney: So I’ll let – George, I’ll let Rod kind of go through a little bit more detail, but the bridging to get at a high level and that’s one of the reasons why we provide these bridging schedules is so that you can – we’re highlighting the things that we – that in our view are one off either because of that something specifically had in the quarter or when we’re talking about the service, where we think we’re going to end up at the end of the year, in terms of service margins based on some of the improvements that we’re making. So the intent of those bridging schedule is to guide you to where we think we’re moving to – where we should being on a normalized basis on an OIBDA margin basis. But Rod, may want to comment in more detail on that.
Rod Day: Yes, maybe to answer the question in two parts. First, instances would be underlying not sure if you like – at the P&L, basically what we expect to see continuous improvement in performance as the year progresses. And that is to be expected as you know, that’s key volume continues to build at the decent price closer to decent margin. So quarter after quarter after quarter, we should continue to build. Around that, obviously then you have to some of these one offs in the quarter and we pulled out a couple of them one with this bad debt expense issue and Bill referencing some of the deals related to the offshoring of our drilling activities. We also had a – an investment in the data management space around new product introduction, which obviously the expectation of that is there will be returns coming from that in future. So there were a couple of some key one-offs for the quarter. But to underlying that that sort of [indiscernible] fundamentals of the P&L, this was a relentless drive upwards on the storage side.
George Tong: Got it. And can you talk about how your storage pricing strategy compares with Recall, and how do you think about pricing as a contributor to storage revenue growth going forward?
Rod Day: Well, I think, first of all I can’t comment in terms of compared to refocus. We haven’t exchanged or shared any commercial information. We have to go through the regulatory aspects. So I can’t comment on how we compare to Recall. But I think if you look at the results that we’re getting, as you can see – I mean, I think, the way you look at it is couple of ways, is we’re getting, I would say fairly regular yet modest price increase that offsets the inflation that – the low inflation levels. But I think as I said, I think, a number of times on calls, there’s been low inflation environment, price increases are more challenging. I think the other thing to look at if you look with the – if you look at what’s been happening to our gross margins associated with storage you can see they actually, there’s a slight uptick. So that gives you a view that in a low inflation environment obviously we have wage inflation that is still real in terms of what we pay our folks. But we’re able to get both, productivity increases and pricing increases, that allows us to either maintain or slightly enhance our gross margin. So we feel pretty good in terms of what we’re getting, in terms of pricing and something that we continue to work on, I think I told you we brought somebody in about a year-ago, just to our new leader for the pricing group that seems to be getting some good traction. But I also think it’s important to understand that in the low inflation environment, these are small numbers that you are dealing with, you are not dealing with large order of magnitude. But the results are good. I mean our gross margins are stable and I would say it is slightly higher than they were a year-ago.
George Tong: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JP Morgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi Bill, I just want to know if the data management, new products were as planned, should we expect a similar level of investment to $1.5 million, in the quarter in the second half of the year. And if you could just give us a little description or these new products in the area of capable all thing or is it something a little different with then data archiving?
Bill Meaney: Hi, Andrew, good morning. There is couple of aspects, first of all what we have in the bridge was a very specific one-off associated with our relaunch of a product that’s associated with secured destructions. So that was a very specific one-off re-launch of that particular product. I think that there even if you add that back, you will notice that our margins are slightly down from where they were a year ago, albeit they are very good margins. But they are slightly down. And we didn’t bridge to that for the reason that your highlighting right now is, we are – we have made a conscious decision to incur some additional OpEx which is associated with launching new products in that area. So one of the areas, I think, we’ve publicized is that we have a partnership with EMC that offers both their customers and our customers a joint, it’s kind of a combination of our datacenter, our Cap business and EMCs data to main business which a datacenter replication hardware offering they have. And that there is an investment associated with standing up those new products. Our expectation, the reason why we didn’t bridge that is you could say that that was a one-off for this quarter, but our expectation is we will continue to make those kind of investments has we see a pipeline of further products like this one that we’ve announced publicly with EMC. So I think that’s the way I would think about. So what we have in the bridge was very specific to a product launch that we did this quarter that we really anticipate as a one off, but we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur some OpEx investments in terms of the new product launches.
Andrew Steinerman: And was that always envisioned in the plan like – so that spending now doesn’t affect the guide for the year.
Bill Meaney: Yes, – no that was always in the plan and that was part of separating data management under a separate leader as you know that we brought in Eileen Sweeney just a year ago specifically, so that was part of the plan.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. And then if you let me one more. The bad debt write-off the 3.8, obviously that’s a surprise. Are you hoping some of the cost initiatives that you’re talking about could offset that? Or does that in some way kind of tilt the EBITDA guidance towards the lower end?
Bill Meaney: No, I think that what we’ve said in the press release as you’ve noticed that we think that on a reported dollar basis that we are still within the range of our guidance. On a revenue basis, we think we’re in the lower end of the range, but on a reported dollar basis, but it’s in the range that we’ve guided to. So we still feel comfortable about maintaining our guidance that our OIBDA will be in the range as we said out at the beginning of the year. I think the specific – think about the specific highlight that we’ve talked about on bad debt and I will ask Rod to comment further. But its more about an ageing issue in terms of when we moved the process, we didn’t optimize the process fully before we moved to offshore and we move that offshore as we slipped behind on the dating. So we feel – we feel good over the next six months to 12 months that we are – we will be able to get that back in shape and we are well underway, but you can imagine that when you slip behind on the dating it takes a while to fix that back up, but I don t know Rod, if you want to add?
Rod Day: That’s right, Bill in terms of the general component of our bad debt provision its driven by the aging of our receivables and as we move this offshore, the aging deteriorate and a little bit and therefore that triggers an increase in the bad debts and bad debt expense by half a point. And we are – I think we – just to make sure as clear as I, we will get back to our normal range of about a half a point of revenue in terms of bad debt expense…
Andrew Steinerman: Right.
Bill Meaney: Absolutely right, and though – I don’t know we have various rigorous plans to ensure that that is the case. And just to be absolutely clear in terms of the contribution guidance, we’re in no way signaling the lower end of the ranges very well, so within the range on that.
Andrew Steinerman: Perfect, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev of Jefferies.
Dan Dolev: It’s actually Dan Dolev with Jefferies. Thanks for taking my questions. I’ll ask few questions. We thought a few weeks ago, Bill you did the conference call, you mentioned service margins stabilizing. I see a 330 basis points decline. What gives you confidence that that you could actually stabilize margins in the coming quarters?
Bill Meaney: Hey, good morning Dan. [Indiscernible] it’s a good question. So if we look – obviously this quarter was below our target of getting 27% by the end of the year. But if you actually – when we looked at the performance as part of the improvement program we looked at. If we took the month of May, May was a specifically weak month for us on this quarter in terms of our service margin and profitability. If we took the month of May out, we would have 26.1% service margin in this quarter, which is still a 100 basis points, but we know how to bridge that gap. And even when we looked at May some of the things that we’re introducing, we get the sprit [ph] to manage them. So with the month of May, was particularly soft really two things, was one, is verbalizing some of our cost quick enough associated with a normal downtick in revenue, because there is some seasonality in revenue and plus it was a short month. But in terms of the way the holiday is felt. So those two things that – which is part of our program, if you remember our three-pronged approach to this is verbalizing our cost base more which the month of May is a great example in terms of what that program is designed to offset. The second thing is using outside parties, and the third one is technology. So, again, the data for the quarter looks worse than it is if you know what I mean in terms – especially if we add back some of the programs that we’ve introduced to minimize that going forward. So we still are sticking by our guidance that we think by the end of the year will be at 27%.
Dan Dolev: hank you and two more quick questions. On the bad debt expense, I know you’ve addressed it fully, so the uptick from 50 basis points to 70 basis points, is that – was that a result of ageing or did I misunderstand it?
Bill Meaney: Yes, it’s primarily the result of ageing, is the issue that we’ve referred to earlier.
Dan Dolev: Got it. And without result in any impairment to the capitalized acquisition cost on the balance sheet or…
Bill Meaney: No, no, not, no.
Dan Dolev: Nothing, okay. And then last question, when I was looking at – EPS obviously was a little slight outdated versus consensus. If you look at both FFO and EPS, it does imply a very significant acceleration in the second half of the year, can you maybe talk a little bit about how your components have actually getting it.
Bill Meaney: Well, I think first of all on the AFFO basis you see, we’re actually been ahead of where the consensus status coming out. So first of all from a cash standpoint we’re actually ahead. I think the bridging schedules I think do a pretty good job in terms of what the puts and the takes were in terms of why we ended up a bit below on consensus. But if you just look at our normal ramp in the second half of the year, part of this is just in terms that we don’t give quarterly guidance we give a year guidance and part of this just a way that the [indiscernible] besides the carve out our annual guidance. So if you just look at historical ramps in the second half, you don’t find this is as surprise. That’s why I feel very comfortable in terms of maintaining our guidance.
Rod Day: I mean may be just talk specific about EPS, year-to-date we’re at on an adjusted basis $0.60 a share, the midpoint of our guidance for the full year is $122.5 million [ph]. And so you could see we’re almost at the halfway point. As I was saying earlier, because of the dynamics of our business, the storage revenue and contribution growing and quarter-after-quarter, I think you can sort of see how we can reach that point.
Dan Dolev: Right, I was also referring to FFO, it’s a midpoint is about a – it prices about 14% acceleration?
Bill Meaney: And I think what’s deciding is the same logic, if you like in terms of the flow through, the P&L. So we expect contributions to continue to build, that actually has a disproportion of banks, in sense of the flow through to the FFO. So again we feel comfortable around that number.
Dan Dolev: Great, thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Shlomo here. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Yes, Bill, could you go into little bit more detail what you mean about variabilizing the cost with third-party logistics vendors, and we talked about working with like UPS or FedEx or something?
Rod Day: Yeah, good morning, Shlomo. Well, there is two parts, it is variabilizing and is using third-party so that there – and you could say that there kind of two – there is two ways of doing it. We also look at variabilizing more of our cost under own our control and we do use temporary workers that are trained and certified and cleared by Iron Mountain, it’s getting that mix right. So first of all we do have a variabilized workforce internally and making sure that we are using more of that which is the thing that helps to offset some of these variabilization of some of the service revenue that goes through and then service revenue for us don’t forget it is more than just transport they rather bid that are contract based so that’s one aspect. And then on the 3PL side, yes it is like the – it’s the FedEx and UPSs of this world and other courier services. We use some of them today, we use them more extensively in some European countries, where we – where the necessity has come even faster because of the size of some of our operations in some of the smaller countries. And we’re using that same doll as a know-how to accelerate that in North America. So it is anytime those logos and others.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great. Thanks for your clarification. Then maybe this is for Rod, the non-real estate investments in the maintenance CapEx, at least for the first half of the year is trending well below the annual targets. Is this expected to get a tick up in the second half of the year or for some reason, where just current levels are more of a good run rate. How should we think of that?
Rod Day: I think there will be a tick up in the second half of the year, but closer to the guidance numbers that we issued in June. It’s just to do with the phasing at certain aspects of all activity.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Is that a – is there seasonal component to that or it just happens to be year-by-year, and works in different parts of your base and what your plans are?
Bill Meaney: It’s actually largely based on our own plans. It’s an element of seasonality around some of the maintenance activity that we prefer to sort of backload as opposed to doing in the middle of winter of January, February. But it’s largely down to our own planning.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, and then am I understanding you correctly that while you are guiding to the low end of the guidance range because of currency for revenue, you are not winning [ph] to that for – what for – am I misunderstanding that?
Bill Meaney: Yeah, that’s correct, that’s correct. So we are taking action on cost to ensure that we still stay towards the midpoint of our guidance right from a constant and a real dollar perspective on contribution and cash.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: And is that because of this program or largely because of this program that you just announced [indiscernible] third quarter charge?
Bill Meaney: No, actually that’s not that specifically in fact that the transformation program for us is neutral because we incur severance charge during Q3, which will be offset by run rate savings in Q4. This is more due to other activity that we’re taking.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Bill Meaney: Okay, well thank you very much everyone for joining us this morning and have a good day.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Felicia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q1 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will now like to hand the conference over to Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Melissa Marsden - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Felicia, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As I'm sure, everyone joining us this morning knows, we also announced an agreement in principle to acquire Recall. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter, some key points related to the proposed transaction, as well as progress toward our strategic initiatives; followed by Rod Day, our CFO, who will cover financial results. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. As we have done for the last few quarters, we have posted our earnings commentary and supplemental disclosure package on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com under Investor Relations/Financial Information. We've also posted there a brief presentation related to the proposed Recall transaction at the same location. Referring now to page two of the supplemental, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for 2015 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and in the Recall presentation and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures as required by Reg G are included in the supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Let me first extend our apology for such a short notice on the change in timing for the release of first quarter results. But given that it was driven by our agreement in principle to acquire Recall, we felt it was important to combine the news. I would like to start by saying, we are pleased to announce that our results in the first quarter meet or exceed our expectations. We continue to build operational momentum in the business, which is, in turn, driving strong financial results in spite of the significant FX headwinds. However, given the breaking news associated with the agreement in principle to acquire Recall, I'd like to start with the discussion of this agreement. First, I should say, we are very excited about our agreed proposal to acquire Recall. We think this proposed transaction represents an attractive value proposition supported by significant synergies and believe it will be highly accretive. Our revised offer reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and other favorable changes since our last proposal, particularly regarding transaction related tax assumptions. Of course, we have yet to complete due diligence to reach a definitive agreement and the successful completion of the transaction is subject to customary conditions noted in today's press release. We have a few slides related to the proposal, the proposed transaction that we have posted to our Investor Relations website, which I'll touch on briefly. Turning first to slide three, the proposed acquisition is an all stock deal at a fixed exchange rate of 0.1722 of an Iron Mountain share for each Recall share. Additionally, we've made a provision that each Recall shareholder can elect up to a maximum of 5,000 shares to be paid in cash at AUD$8.50 per share subject to a cap on the total cash consideration of AUD$225 million. On slide five, we estimate there is an opportunity to achieve synergies of between US$125 million and US$140 million driven by economies of scale from the combination of infrastructure and overhead. We expect to realize 50% of these synergies in year two, which will already yield by year two, high-single digit accretion in EPS, FFO and AFFO. Another benefit of the proposed transaction in the medium term is that, it supports our de-leveraging strategy. Additionally, we have complementary market platforms with Recall having a more developed presence with the small-to-medium businesses in the U.S. whilst we have more significant presence with larger enterprise customers in the U.S. Turning to slide six, we also have complementary geographic coverage with Recall having more exposure to faster growing international markets. Slide seven provides a bit more detail on the benefits to Recall shareholders, including the ability through stock ownership to participate in future upside and be supported through a secondary listing in Australia. Slide eight shows more detail on our estimated net synergies as well as our expected integration and other costs that would be incurred in year one to achieve those synergies. Assuming the midpoint of the synergy range, consensus estimates of Recall's 2015 EBITDA and the fixed exchange ratio, we estimate our going-in EBITDA multiple is just over 12 times and is reduced by 4 turns to 4.5 turns on a fully synergized basis, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed transaction. Lastly, on slide nine, we've provided a list of next steps in the process. With that overview of the proposed transaction, let me turn to our results. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, extending recent progress with continued positive organic volume growth in solid storage rental internal growth. We continue to execute on our three-year strategic plan, which rests on three pillars; getting more from our developed markets, expanding our presence in faster growing emerging markets, and continue to explore adjacent opportunities in our emerging business segment. Rod will have more details in a few minutes but I'll start by highlighting that on a constant dollar basis, our financial results for the first quarter were in line or ahead of our expectations, with total revenue up 2% and adjusted OIBDA up 5.7% on a constant dollar basis or 4.5% on a constant dollar basis if normalized for restructuring charges as shown on page 20 in our supplemental. We saw further strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter, which impacted our reported results, but the fundamental trends in the business remains solid and we are pleased with the momentum. Our results are supported by the durability of our storage rental business and are in line with our strategic plan. If you reviewed our supplemental disclosure before the call today, you probably noted that we added a further breakdown of our International business. Effective with this quarter's reporting; we've broken the former International segment into Western Europe and Other International. With this segment change, we've consolidated executive leadership of North America and Western European markets under Patrick Keddy to provide better focus and alignment within our developed markets. Patrick has run our UK and Western European markets for several years now, having originally joined us from Pitney Bowes, where he ran its entire business outside the U.S., including operations in 28 countries. JT Tomovcsik will continue to run our North American Records and Information Management business and Eileen Sweeney will add Western Europe to her leadership responsibilities and will head Data Management in all developed markets. She and JT will coordinate their efforts through Patrick. This integration of executive leadership in North America and Western Europe will allow us to present a single face to our major customers in our largest markets and we'll be better positioned as a global service provider not just a company with a global footprint. Marc Duale will continue to run emerging markets through the Other International segment, which covers Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Central and Eastern Europe. This segment also includes Australia as it is easy to manage within this segment due to the geographic proximity. We think this structure will better fuel our continued momentum in developed markets and continue our expansion in emerging markets, thereby more closely tying performance to our strategic plan. Turning to operating highlights, total storage revenue, a key economic driver of our business, grew by 4.6% on a constant dollar basis during the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth from the Other International segment and consistent trends in Western Europe as well as North America, RIM, and DM or Data Management. Worldwide, internal growth in storage rental of 3%, continued to show resilience. Whilst, internal growth did benefit slightly from favorable comps relative to the 1.4% internal storage rental growth in the same period last year, we are seeing continued momentum and are maintaining our view for internal storage rental revenue growth for 2015 of between 2% and 2.5%. In Records Management, we added roughly 18 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a trailing 12-month basis, representing 3.5% net growth. This growth was in part achieved as a result of the significant turnaround we are continuing to achieve in North America from negative to positive internal volume growth, or in other words, before benefit from acquisitions. Importantly, North America represents nearly 25% of our net volume gains for the trailing 12 months excluding acquisitions. Globally, we maintained customer retention of 98% in line with our fourth quarter 2014 levels, but a significant improvement over the level of customer turnover experienced just two years ago. In our Data Management business, we continue to see solid storage revenue growth, although as noted in recent quarters, we are still experiencing headwinds related to reduced frequency of customer tape rotation. Whilst we continue to evaluate ways to right-size our cost structure to align with this trend, we are continuing to develop new product and services in the Data Management segment to leverage our strong customer relationships in the more than 200,000 stops we make each month. During the quarter Google named us as the ingestion partner for its new Nearline cloud solution. This means we are the preferred provider to assist Google Cloud customers in uploading all the data saved in legacy data storage formats that predated cloud storage so they can better use big data. We plan to begin offering this service later this summer. We also are seeing good early reception to our Restoration Assurance Program that helps customers retrieve data from legacy media and optimize their backup environment for future technologies. Moreover, just last week we announced a strategic relationship with EMC to deliver cloud backup and replication services, which helps customers optimize their on-premise and off-premise data protection strategy. We are the only one of their providers to offer data domain replication to the cloud with tape-out capabilities. These new initiatives are in their early days, and we are not guiding to a specific contribution from them, but they demonstrate our thought leadership, innovation capabilities and partnership with other world leaders in information management like Google and EMC. Turning to emerging markets, we are making good progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from emerging markets by the end of next year. These high growth markets represent 13.6% of our total revenue at the end of the quarter on a constant dollar basis. Like most multinationals, we do have exposure to the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings and cash impact in U.S. dollars. While FX variability does impact the absolute dollars we report, the impact on our gross and adjusted OIBDA margins is almost completely muted because most of our expenses are denominated in local currency, thereby creating a natural hedge. On the other hand, the current FX environment gives us a positive window in terms of investments. Given our opportunity to expand internationally on what is today a relatively small international base, we believe we can create significant value over time by investing selectively in these higher growth markets using strong U.S dollars during this part of the currency cycle. We continue to see attractive growth potential in both storage and service in emerging markets as they are still in the early part of the outsourcing of enterprise storage. Internal storage rental growth in our Other International segment was 11.1% in the first quarter. Rod will describe more fully the impact of foreign currency exchange rate impacts on our reported performance for the quarter. Furthermore, we intend to pursue attractive investment opportunities that extend durability of the storage rental business. As we've discussed on recent calls, we plan to buy $700 million to $1 billion of our leased facilities over the next eight years to 10 years, shifting our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties. On average, we are achieving a spread of roughly 150 basis points between our going-in cap rates and market cap rates, whilst positioning ourselves to capture long-term residual value from ownership. Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals. It does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. As we became more active in buying in our properties and executing on our acquisition pipeline, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing and/or equity issuance similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth. As you think about opportunities to grow our storage rental business, it is important not to lose sight of the solid durability of the business, which is underpinned by roughly $1.5 billion of net operating income from our storage business alone. This amount of NOI is comparable to that generated by the leaders in the industrial and self-storage sectors. And we have other attractive business characteristics that compare favorably with REITs. Our enterprise storage foundation is similar to self-storage, but we serve more than 92% of the Fortune 1000 with superior customer credit quality. We have a diversified base of more than 155,000 business customers with 98% customer retention and a 15-year average life of box in our facilities. Our business has a very low volatility, as highlighted by a track record of 26 years the consecutive growth in storage rental revenue even throughout the recent recession. And like self-storage we have a service component to our business that is inextricably linked to our customers' underlying storage needs. We also compare very favorably with the industrial sector with the major difference that our real estate costs are incurred by the square foot but we generate storage rental revenue by the cubic foot, yielding a very high net operating income per square foot. Similar to the industrial sector, we have a low maintenance CapEx requirement, but our turnover costs are even lower on a per foot basis. And when we invest in incremental Racking Structures within an existing industrial shell, we generate very strong returns due to the leverage associated with this volume achieved with reduced growth CapEx. To wrap up, we're excited to be announcing the proposed transaction with Recall and reporting a quarter of strong operating performance. Our results were in line with or ahead of expectations and we remain on track to achieve our long-term goals. Our business is durable and generates strong cash flow that more than covers our dividend and provides a portion of growth CapEx. And as we look at our longer-term growth potential, we have multiple capital allocation opportunities to invest in attractive returns that exceed our cost of capital and support long-term growth in our dividend. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Bill. We're pleased with the momentum we continue to see in our business and the strong operating performance we saw in the first quarter of 2015. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our storage rental business and the benefits of acquisitions we made in developed and emerging markets in prior periods. Before I begin, I'd like to note that our outlook for 2015 doesn't contemplate potential contribution or impact from the proposed transaction with Recall. As noted by Bill, we have yet to reach a definitive agreement; we're just embarking on the due diligence process. To frame my remarks, I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter performance, including a review of our new segment disclosure. I'll briefly touch on our outlook for 2015, which remains unchanged since our update in February of this year. Finally, I will address other metrics through a REIT lens. Let's turn to our worldwide financial results for the quarter. Referring now to pages eight and nine of our supplemental, supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues were $749 million, up approximately 2.2% compared with Q1 of 2015 on a constant dollar basis. Reported revenue for the quarter declined by 2.7% year-over-year as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which impacted total revenues by approximately 5% or $37 million. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $231 million compared with $229 million in 2014, up 1.2% on a reported basis and 5.7% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted OIBDA increased year-over-year due to improved storage profits, somewhat offset by a reduction in service profits. In addition, overhead expenses declined partly as we are seeing the benefits of our efficiency initiatives. To illustrate the 4.5% year-over-year improvement in normalized adjusted OIBDA, we've included a bridging schedule on page 20 of our supplemental package. Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.50 for the quarter, while adjusted funds from operations or AFFO was $128 million. The year-over-year decline in AFFO was driven by variances in deferred tax expenses. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.32 per diluted share compared with $0.35 in the first quarter of 2014. The decline in adjusted EPS year-over-year is driven by a 10% increase in share count related to the special distribution we made in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, adjusted EPS was impacted by an increase in interest expense related to higher levels of debt and a slightly higher structural tax rate. The increase in borrowings was driven primarily by REIT conversion related expenses such as E&P purge and the D&A recapture payments. Our structural tax rate for Q1 2015 came out to 16.2% as result of a slight mix change driven by a higher income from foreign jurisdictions. It's important to note that adjusted EPS for 2014 was restated to be on a comparable basis using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the longer-term. To illustrate the changes to adjusted EPS, we've included a bridging schedule on page 21 of our supplemental. The fundamentals of our business remained strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental growth of 5%, offset by a decline in service revenue of 1% on a constant dollar basis. As Bill mentioned, in an effort to look more closely tie our leadership structure to the strategic plan, we have broken out the former International segments into two segments, Western Europe and Other International, to facilitate managing the business along the developed emerging lines we've talked about in the past. I will now discuss Records Management or RM volume trend across this new segmentation. As you can see in the supplemental, on pages 10 and 11, we've expanded our disclosure by illustrating Records Management volume trends by segments. As you can see, we've achieved positive volume growth of 1.2% in North America, 5.4% in Western Europe, and 12.9% in the Other International segments, reporting Global Records Management net volume growth of 3.5%. We continue to experience strong organic growth with first quarter total year-on-year volume growth of 1.9% excluding acquisitions. Underlying this growth is the stable incoming volume from existing customers who added approximately 30 million gross cubic feet of storage in the last 12 months, which is consistent with prior periods. Let's now turn to our financial performance by segments. North America Records and Information Management, or RIM delivered positive storage rental internal growth and expanded OIBDA margins by more than 300 basis points during the first quarter. This expansion in adjusted OIBDA margins was driven by a decline in overhead costs as we continue to execute on our speed and agility efforts. North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 5.2% in the first quarter. However, service declined by 5.9% as DM tape management becomes more archival. During the first quarter, DM adjusted OIBDA declined to 52.7%, partly as a result of the new product launches related to our Restoration Assurance Program and other initiatives that Bill covered in his remarks. We believe these will prove very positive investments for the longer-term. The Western Europe segment generated solid results, with 3.7% storage rental internal growth, which was partially offset by a decline of 2.6% in internal service revenue. The Western Europe business is similar to North America in its level of market maturity. However, there are certain countries within these segments, where we don't have a strong leadership position, which in turn results in profit margins that are lower than North American margins, although returns are still well above required hurdle rates. In addition, it's important to note that the Western Europe segment includes head office costs, which reduces our adjusted OIBDA margins. Excluding the head office costs, the margin in this segment would be in the mid to high 30% range. Adjusted OIBDA margin percentages remain stable in the first quarter despite the decline in service revenues, although absolute dollar adjusted OIBDA fell primarily as a result of FX headwinds. The Other International segments, which is made up of emerging markets in Australia, showed strong growth in both storage and service revenues. Storage rental internal growth was 11.1%, and service internal growth was 6.8%. We expect adjusted OIBDA for this segment to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in the high-teens to low 20%s range as we continue to expand our exposure in these fast growing markets. Adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter was impacted by FX headwinds and integration costs. Historical data for Other International on a full year basis will be available in our amended 10-K which will be filed in the short-term. As I mentioned at the outset, our outlook for 2015 remains consistent with the guidance we provided in February during our fourth quarter earnings call. In addition, at this time, our guidance doesn't reflect the benefit or impact of the potential Recall transaction. Business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent. Operationally, we remain on-track to deliver our long-term financial objectives, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. That said, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to impact our reported results. However, we believe that, we will remain within the ranges of our guidance. As a reminder, our guidance includes an expectation of roughly 12% decline in reported non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue for 2015 relative to FX rates in place in 2014. Revenues outside the U.S. make up 40% of total worldwide revenue. As a result, we expect the FX impact on total revenue for 2015 to be 4% to 5%. Lastly, although there is no seasonality to our quarters, there is typically a moderate ramp in revenue performance as the year progresses. Our strong cash flow continues to support our dividend at current levels, and we expect our dividends to grow in line with operating performance. Our estimate for cash available for distribution and discretionary investment for 2015 remains $470 million, which gives us ample dividend coverage and the ability to fund a portion of our core growth investments. As we've previously said, we expect to fund discretionary investments including real estate and acquisitions through external funding whether through equity or borrowings. Shifting to the balance sheet, at quarter end, we had a liquidity of more than $780 million. Quarter end, our lease adjusted ratio was 5.5 times as planned. At Monday's stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 38%, in line with major REIT averages. Turning now to REIT specific metrics, as we begin to accelerate consolidation of facilities and execute on our real estate purchase plan, we expect to increase the portion of owned facilities by square footage. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI approximately $27 per racked square foot worldwide, which compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector. Our racking and building utilization rates are high at 91% and 83%, respectively for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90%s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about three years' time. We added a new page to the supplemental, page 32, which highlights our investments for racking projects in process, building development and building acquisitions by major geographic region, their total expected return and anticipated returns. We will continue to enhance our disclosure as we move forward through the year. Lastly, similar to prior quarters, we are providing components of value, a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. In an effort to ensure transparency to our shareholders, we will continue to enhance our supplemental disclosure and provide more details to help you better understand our business and its underlying fundamentals. As always we welcome your feedback. Operator, with that, we will now take questions.
Operator: And your first question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, congratulations on Recall and actually the results, just a great outcome and obviously with the REIT just very good execution. My question was more along the lines of what does the organic growth look like, the combined entity post the deal? And then just – and I know it's probably little bit ways out but how does that impact kind of the dividend and just leverage ratios on a pro forma basis to the extent you can give us any color?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi. Good morning, Kevin.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, Bill.
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think you're going to appreciate that we haven't done our due diligence to this point, so to give us – to give you specific guidance, we're just not in a position to do that. I think that – I think you can probably get a sense of it in terms of we – we're looking at something that synergizes in the 7.5 times to 8 times range based on the $125 million to $140 million worth of synergies we've guided. So it is clearly very accretive on EPS, FFO and AFFO, which obliviously drives to deleveraging and dividend growth. But at this point, we haven't done the due diligence on the company so we're not in a position to guide for that.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And then just those synergies, Bill, they assume any potential divestitures you might have to do to the extent there is any trust concern?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: You can probably appreciate that we have taken counsel on the anti-trust side and we feel that there is a very good – a very good beneficial path through any of the hurdles that we may meet in terms of regulatory.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Super. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi, thanks. Good morning. And I'll also extend my congratulations on your agreement to acquire Recall. You've outlined cost synergies between $125 million and $140 million. Can you discuss your confidence around achieving these synergies and provide some thoughts on how much tax synergies you might achieve from the transaction?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, George. I think, first of all the synergies include both tax and operational benefits. I mean it's probably fair to say we've been a little bit conservative because we've just been relying on really public information and we haven't been able to do due diligence. So we feel very confident that we can deliver those numbers but you'll notice we're probably less bullish than some of the analysts' reports that have been written previously on. So we are pretty comfortable and that is – that's including all the regulatory aspects, tax aspects and operational aspects built into that number, the puts and takes associated with that.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, maybe just to build on that, Bill and George, as you know we've done hundreds of acquisitions over the year, obviously not on this (33:55) scale. But we try to use that experience when – to come to bear in sort of calculating what we think is a sensible range for synergies (34:05).
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): That's helpful. And can you walk through your expectations for the regulatory approval process, including timing and your expectations around market share discussions?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Again, we've taken a counsel on that. In other words, we've been in consultation for a period of time now with external counsel that specializes in that area, and we think we can achieve a satisfactory outcome. But we haven't finalized the proposal, we haven't done any fillings. So at this point to speculate on that I think it would be pure speculation. But we do feel that based on the studies that we've done so far with external counsel that we'll achieve a satisfactory outcome.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. And then last question, can you talk about how this transaction impacts your ability to continue to operate as a REIT?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: This – our – again that was one of our key pieces of analysis that we did when we looked at the acquisition is to determine our level of confidence that we could both acquire it and absorb it into our REIT structure, in other words, convert the Recall assets into a REIT. And again, we will confirm that through the due diligence process, but we are highly confident that we can do that. So we wouldn't do it otherwise unless we could convert the Recall assets into the REIT.
George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, it's Andrew. Just tell me if I missed this, again I would like to know the question asked before out of the $125 million to $140 million, how much are the potential tax savings from REIT conversion?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I can give you a sort of approximate number, Andrew, based on our analysis so far. We think it's around $10 million, could be slightly more. But clearly that's one of the elements that we'd hope to get a better handle on through due diligence.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. So you are only assuming $10 million, so that could be a conservative estimate.
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, you have to look at the size of Recall's business in North America that is storage related, so don't forget their business is not that large in North America, it's a global business, but it's in North America where you have the tax benefits. So their tax liability in North America is not as big as you may think.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So we don't get – there wouldn't be savings on the shredding business as an example.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Well said. So if I can get one more question. Okay. So let's assume low tax benefits, be conservative there, you're talking about still four times turn pre to post synergies. If you look at Iron Mountain's history, it's really kind of been two times to four times, so this would be towards the high end of the synergies. And when I look at Recall's racking utilization of about 90%, that's really close to Iron Mountain's racking utilization. What other things do you know again from the public that makes you feel like you can get towards the high end of pre to post synergies, synergization multiples.
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Andrew, if you – the thing that's a little bit unique about Recall, it is at the higher end, but we have achieved that before as you pointed out. And the reason why we feel that it's at the higher end and maybe it exceeds some of our best integrations is that Recall is one of the few out there that runs an international platform. So they have a lot – if you look at their SG&A, it's very different than the SG&A of a small regional player. Because they are actually built – they are running a global company with all the costs that are associated with that, albeit they are doing at a scale that's one forth our size. So if you look at their SG&A, I think you can get a handle on why we feel that the $125 million to $140 million is actually a conservative or – we feel very confident around that number.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. That was a good reminder. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys thank you for taking my questions. Bill, could you talk a little bit about the realistic timeframe – in the first year you talked about – you mentioned maybe half the synergies. What's the realistic timeframe to kind of get the balance of the synergies? Is this something that facility consolidation really takes kind of two years to five years or how should we think of that in terms of conceptually and potentially modeling it?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Shlomo, you've been around a long time, so you answer the question for me. But no, I think, it's a good question. So just to clarify, in year two there we think we'll be half way through the synergies. So the first year, I mean, first year we're assuming is 2016 just for people to be level set. So, year two would be 2017. So we think 2016 is a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of the restructuring, then in 2017 is when you start – that that cost starts falling away and you start seeing the benefits split bleed through. So 2002 – I think at – year two 2017 we see about half the benefits coming through. And exactly as you say, we'll get a better handle on it through due diligence but the rest of it comes through – a lot of it is driven by the real estate consolidation and that generally takes the timeframe you're talking about two years to five years. It depends on the nature of their leases and our leases in the areas that we're overlapping.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just from a fundamental perspective, how is the volume growth in North American Records Management this quarter over the second half of last year, you guys generated positive growth, can you kind of talk about will the trend continue, was it up, down, the same?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: I'm sorry, I didn't get the question. I heard the beginning of it you were referring back to the continued growth, the internal volume growth in North America but what was – what did you say at the end?
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. I just – did the trend – we had for years seen volumes be down, but kind of revenue be flat to up a little bit because of pricing. The second half of last year, we saw North American volumes get to be positive, do we – in this first quarter what was the trend in North American volumes?
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Actually in the supplemental on page 10, we've broken this all the key numbers out in more detail than we've done historically. And what you can see, if you were to strip out business acquisitions to just sort of look underlying, there was a 0.5% growth year-on-year in Q1 2015, which actually compares quite consistently with the previous three quarters. And then if you go back further in time looking at this chart, at the beginning of 2013, you can see that to your point was when we were at zero or negative growth.
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: One thing I want – and this was feedback that we received from a number of analysts and investors. So hopefully if you look in the supplemental on pages 10 and 11, I'd direct you to those, in part of the organizational shift and putting all of the developed markets under a single leader, is we've been – we've broken out and built a lot more transparency in terms of how our volume works. And then – so hopefully you'll start seeing, you can see how that trend has been building as you say, as Rod pointed out, Q1, we maintained the same 0.5% positive volume growth as we did in Q4, just in the North American business. And you have to remember you can say those are small percentages but it's off a very big base. So North America alone we have over 370 million cubic feet. So it's significant.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And if I just want to look ahead a little bit into the future, in terms of the REIT structure, what happens if paper pricing kind of bounces back to what it was like three years, three and half years ago, do you have enough kind of room in the REIT structure that you're not worried about coming close to any of the – kind of the restrictions that are over there in terms of assets and income?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: I'll let Rod kind of answer it in detail, but the one thing, I think we covered this on previous calls, you need to keep in mind is that there is, at some point, actually increasing profitability on our shred helps us the way the test works because there is a back and forth. In other words, we have to get shred to a certain level of profitability. So, having higher prices – having higher profitability in shred doesn't necessarily lead to the result that you think it does. So that's kind of at a very high level way of saying we have plenty of headroom, but, Rod, you may want to be a bit more specific.
Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, there's actually a specific on shred, as Bill says around sort of cross subsidization between the QRS and the TRS, so that if we increase the profitability of shred, it would actually work to the advantage of some of our REIT tests. But I think the broader point and – that you make, Shlomo, is that around just sensitivity to issues within the business and do we have enough cushion within our REITs and against the REIT test to be able to handle that. We think we do. It's something that we're very conscious of and we analyze lots of different scenarios and sensitivities to try and ensure that that is the case.
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: And very specifically which is probably what's behind your question is if we look at the acquisition of Recall, we don't envision a problem of combining. Recall's business is quite a bit smaller, their strip quite a bit smaller than ours in North America. And we don't see a problem in terms of combining those two businesses.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Sachin Shah with Albert Fried.
Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Congratulations on the Recall possible offer. I just wanted to just make sure as far as risk to transaction. I know you're conducting due diligence, but is there anything that you expect that you may uncover or something that may not cause this deal to move forward after you completed due diligence?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: We wouldn't be making a public announcement about the deal if we thought there was a high risk item that would crater the deal. I mean clearly we have to do the due diligence. So, we haven't made a binding agreement, but we have an agreed proposal with Recall and we wouldn't do that if we expected to have a major hiccup in the process. So, we don't see anything.
Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Okay. And in the presentation, you mentioned the ratio is fixed and so in the due diligence process is there a subject for another revision or the due diligence is just confirmation of what's the fixed exchange ratio of 0.1722?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: It's fixed and it's subject to confirmatory due diligence. So, there's no – I mean there's no expectation or you'd have to renegotiate the whole term. So, it really is that we've done enough work on it that we're very comfortable that that is the right valuation. And Recall's board also feels that it's the right valuation for their shareholders. And now the next three weeks to four weeks that we highlighted in the press release is about confirmatory due diligence.
Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Okay. Just one last question, if you don't mind. On the regulatory approvals, you mentioned that you are not expecting any kind of essentially hiccups, any idea what they may be? Is it just to U.S., Australia, or is there any other jurisdictions that may be needed – major jurisdictions?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think you can understand at this point we're not going to comment on what the regulatory authorities in different jurisdictions may think or not think of it. The only thing I would just repeat is that we have taken extensive counsel from external advisors or lawyers on this point and we believe that we will achieve a satisfactory outcome in those jurisdictions.
Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Okay. So, that's not part of the due diligence, that's already done. The due diligence is more operational.
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: We will also learn more about the regulatory aspects during the due diligence. Due diligence is primarily operational, but we will learn a number of things during that period which will be helpful.
Sachin Shah - Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much. Have a great day.
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Han Zhang with Churchill Capital.
Han Zhang - Churchill Capital: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My question is, you said you won't comment on what are the regulatory approvals you're seeking, but could you just tell me more about in which jurisdictions you are seeking those approvals, I mean U.S., Australia, but for example, is China involved?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: At this point, we don't expect an issue in China. Both of our businesses are very small in China. I mean, the Chinese government will take their own view, I'm sure. But it's – both of us have – I mean, it improves both of our position, but neither one of us are very large in the China context.
Han Zhang - Churchill Capital: Okay. And could you tell me how many dividends would you expect to pay before the close of the deal?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it depends on the closing of the deal. We pay quarterly. So, you can see that we expect this deal to close within 12 months. So that would be the maximum you would expect. But I mean, we've – we can't guide on how long it's going to take us to go through the various regulatory authorities to consummate the merger. But we pay quarterly generally, right?
Han Zhang - Churchill Capital: Hi. This is Ramesh, Zhang's colleague. Have you had any informal discussions with any regulators at this point in time?
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: No. We haven't.
Han Zhang - Churchill Capital: Thank you.
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: 
William Leo Meaney - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, looks like we are through the Q&A, operator. I just want to thank you for your flexibility, and again apologies for the short notice, but I think you can imagine that given the timing of achieving a positive result on the acquisition of Recall, we felt it was important to combine that with our earnings call which was originally scheduled for Thursday. So, again, thank you very much for your flexibility, and just to reiterate that we're very pleased in terms of our results in the first quarter, continue to show real momentum in the operating performance and improvement in the business. And of course, we're very excited to finally end the speculation around Recall and to have agreed a proposal to acquire the company. So thank you very much and have a good day.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

The reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, are included in the supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
Bill Meaney: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I think, given recent new stories following on from our December announcement with respect to a proposal to acquire Recall. I think, I should just make a statement before we get into discussing our results for both the quarter and the year. We strongly believe that our acquisition of Recall would provide both companies shareholders with a unique opportunity to participate in the growth of the combined businesses with attractive growth prospects. We believe that there is significant value creation potential from such a transaction for both companies customers as well. We continue to try to figure out ways to narrow the valuation gap, but will only pursue a deal at the right price. We have nothing to report at this time. With that, let me turn to our results. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, wrapping up an eventful year of good progress on our three-year strategic plan and our successful conversion to a REIT. During 2014, we continue to improve results in our developed markets, expanded our exposure to faster growing emerging markets and generated momentum in our emerging business segment. In addition, we expanded our REIT investor outreach and we were added to the MSCI REIT in the FTSE/NAREIT indices, inclusion in these important benchmarks is important for generating a high level -- a higher level of awareness of Iron Mountain as an attractive REIT investment. Let me now turn to financial highlights, Rod, will have more in a few minutes. On a constant dollar basis, our financial results for 2014 were right in line with our expectations. The significant strengthening of the dollar in the fourth quarter impacted our reported figures as it did for most multinational, resulting in growth in total revenue and adjusted OIBDA of over 3%, including restructuring charges. But on a constant dollar basis, we believe more -- which we believe more accurately reflects core operating performance, growth in these measures was just under 5% at the top end of our ranges. These results are supported by the durability of our storage rental business and are in line with our three-year plan to achieve 4% compounded annual growth on a constant dollar basis in both total revenues and adjusted OIBDA. Turning to operating highlights, total storage revenue, the key economic driver of our business was up 5.4% in constant dollars for the year, driven by strong growth of 13% in our international business and roughly 3% gain in both our North American Records and Information Management and Data Management segments. These results reflect our continued focus on driving net positive Records Management volume in storage rental revenue growth in developed markets and further penetration into higher growth emerging markets. In developed markets, we further sharpened our focus with the fourth quarter sale of our shredded operations in the U.K., Ireland and Australia. We chose to divest these businesses because they were much smaller than our North American operations and we did not benefit from the same scale. At the same time, we acquired Securit Records Management in Canada, which brought us nine facilities in 3 million cubic feet of records, including available space to support the on-boarding of a major new customer. In Records Management, we added more than 18 million cubic feet of net storage volume worldwide on a base of 500 million cubic feet at the beginning of the year or 3.6% net growth. The growth was in part achieved as a result of the significant turnaround from negative to positive internal volume growth, in other words, before any impact of acquisitions, we achieved in North America. Importantly, North America represented 20% or more than 20% of our gain for the year, excluding volume from acquisitions. Globally, we maintained customer churn of under 2%. This is unchanged from Q3 levels but represents a 30% improvement over the level of customer losses experienced two years ago. This combination of improved customer retention, growth in new sale and consistent new volume from existing customers drove 3.5% internal storage rental growth in the fourth quarter, continuing the steady improvement we achieved throughout the year. Our strong fourth quarter growth rate did benefit from favorable comps relative to the 1.3% internal storage rental growth in the same period last year, but even when normalizing for that we saw a nice pickup and are pleased with the momentum as we head into 2015. Our internal storage rental revenue growth expectations for this year are in the range of 2% to 2.5%. Turning to emerging markets. We are making good progress towards our goal of 16% of total revenue from emerging markets by the end of next year. These high-growth countries represent 13.9% of our total revenues at the end of the year on a constant dollar basis using our 2014 FX budget rates and a 12.8% on reported basis. You’ll hear from Rod that FX currency rates will be a drag on reported performance this year. Whilst our operating margin in virtually all our countries are naturally hedged and preserved, like most multinationals we’re not immune to the effects of currency translation in terms of absolute earnings impact in U.S. dollars. However, given our opportunity to expand internationally on what is today a relatively small international base, we like the fact that we have the benefit of investing in U.S. dollars overseas during this part of the currency cycle. We continue to see attractive growth potential in both storage and service in these markets as they’re beginning to embrace outsourcing of enterprise storage, especially given the durability of our business. Both internal total revenue and internal storage rental growth in these markets was more than 15% in the fourth quarter. In addition, unlike more mature multinational growth rates are fairly similar around the globe, we are in a unique position to invest in our capital markets where we are still early in the growth cycle enabling us to capture higher growth rates of a lower basis, thereby enhancing our returns in the medium-to-long term. Given this is a backdrop, acquisitions continue to be an integral part of our strategy with a focus on high-growth emerging markets. We completed $190 million of acquisitions in 2014, including the records inventory of smaller Records Management companies with more than $125 million of the total in emerging markets through Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific regions. We have a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities in emerging markets with more than four times the coverage needed to achieve our goal of 16% on a constant dollar basis and will continue to evaluate those opportunities in light of our targeted returns in favorable underlying growth dynamics that support the durability of our business. Within our emerging business opportunity area, we continue to make progress in our data center operations. We have invested more than $70 million to date with $35 million of that in 2014 expanding our capacity in the underground facility in delivering our first phase in Boston. Whilst absorption in our Boston data center is just beginning to pick up on a blended basis, we have achieved stabilized unlevered return on invested capital in this business of 9%, which we feel -- which we feel is good given how recently we added our new capacity and expected this return will stabilize at 11% to 12% on a fully utilized basis. We continue to evaluate other emerging business opportunities that leverage our unique platform as a leader in enterprise storage. We see the potential to extend our brand strength in chain of custody and logistics to a broader range of offerings. Many of these opportunities are customer driven where they asked for our assistance in solving an enterprise storage need whether it be upstream in their supply chain or downstream to support distribution. We expect to have more on this at our Investor Day in October. These facets of our strategic plan, all support the durability of our business, the sustainability of our cash flow and are fit as a REIT. When you consider the nature of our business, our enterprise storage foundation compares very favorably with self-storage. We have superior customer credit quality given our service to more than 92% of the Fortune 1000. We serve more than 155,000 business customers, which leads to a diversified revenue stream in low customer churn of less than 2% per year. Unlike consumer self-storage where customers tend to be in transition and frequently have more temporary need, the average life of a box in our facilities is 15 years. This means we have very low volatility. In fact, we posted 26 years of consecutive growth in storage rental revenue, which persisted even throughout the great financial crisis. And like self-storage, we have a service component to our business that is inextricably linked to our customers underlying storage needs. We also compare very favorably with the industrial sector if you think about the nature of our operating facilities. The major difference is that our real estate costs are incurred by the square foot but we generate storage rental revenue by the cubic foot. We're essentially renting air. This multiplier effect generates a significant spread between our costs and our return on investment. It yields a very high net operating income per square foot and is core to how we create value for our stockholders. Similar to the industrial sector, we have a low maintenance CapEx requirement but our turnover costs are even lower on a per foot basis. And when we invested incremental racking structures within an existing industrial shell, we can generate very strong returns due to this volume dynamic. As we’ve talked on recent calls, we intend to buy $800 million to $1 billion of our leased facilities over the next 8 to 10 years, shifting our mix to a higher percentage of owned properties. This supports our REIT status but it also means we have more optionality over the long term. If we consolidate in the market and exit buildings that we own, we can leased them to customers for other industrial or distribution uses or we can create value by selling them or redeveloping the underlying real estate in infill markets for alternative use. Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals and does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. As we become more active in buying in our properties and execute our acquisition pipeline, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing and/or equity issuance, similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth. You may have seen that the board declared our first quarter dividend of $0.475 per share this week at a $40 stock price. Our implied cap rate is about 7.5% well above where other property sectors are trading. At the same share price, our dividend represents a 4.8% yield, well in excess of most REITs, combined with our goal to grow adjusted OIBDA by 4% on a compounded rate. Our dividend level supports our goal to deliver total shareholder returns in line with the 8% to 9% TSR or total shareholder return of the S&P 500. And this goal is prior to any potential upside from additional emerging business opportunities. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Rod.
Rod Day: Thanks Bill. We continue to execute well against our strategic plan. And we're pleased with our strong operating performance for the year. Our results underscore the durability of our storage rental business and demonstrate the benefit of acquisitions we have made in emerging and developed markets. I’ll begin today with an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance, followed by an update on our outlook for 2015. I will then address our capital deployment activities and conclude with a discussion of various REIT metrics. Please note that throughout my prepared remarks, I will reference selected slides from our comprehensive supplemental reporting package, which can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Turning to our financial results for the quarter and the year, let me direct you to the financial highlights on page 8. Supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues were $778 million, up approximately 1% compared with Q4 of 2013 and up 5% on a constant dollar basis. For the year, total revenues grew by 3% to $3.1 billion, or by 4% on a constant dollar basis and in constant dollars at the top end of our guidance range. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $220 million, compared with $195 million in 2013. For the full year, adjusted OIBDA grew by 4% to $926 million or by 5% to $934 million on a constant dollar basis. For comparison, adjusted OIBDA for 2014 included $3.5 million of costs associated with the company’s restructuring initiative. In addition, adjusted OIBDA in 2013 included $19 million in the fourth quarter and $23 million in the full year of restructuring costs. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.25 per diluted share, compared with $0.21 in 2013. For full year 2014, adjusted EPS of $1.36 was within our guidance range. As we highlighted on our Q3 earnings call, adjusted EPS for the full year was impacted by REIT compliance costs and an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our conversion to a REIT as well as acceleration of real estate consolidation and some of our acquisitions. It’s important to note that adjusted EPS for 2013 was restated to be on a comparable basis using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. Our structural rate for the year came out to 14% as a result of lower pre-tax income in international jurisdictions, which was impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We continue to believe that our tax rate will be approximately 15% to 16% over the long term. The fundamentals of our business remained strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental revenue growth. On page 9, topline growth for the quarter on a constant dollar basis was up 5%, reflecting solid storage rental revenue gains of 5% and service revenue growth of 4%. The growth in service revenue was driven by increased project activity, improvement in paper revenue, and recent acquisitions. On a constant dollar basis, full year total revenue growth was 4% driven by storage rental revenue gains of 5% and service revenue growth of 3%. Also on the same page, we show total worldwide volume growth. We continue to demonstrate improvements in net volume growth in Records Management, with total year-on-year volume growth of 3.6%, including acquisitions or 1.9%, excluding acquisitions. Growth, excluding acquisitions, maintained the steady improvements in performance that we have seen in the last two years. Within this, we continue to see strong volume from existing customers, provided approximately 30 million cubic feet of storage worldwide in this category. This number of boxes is consistent with prior years, but the percentage growth dipped to just below 6% in Q4, driven by the denominator effects of our growing base of records under management. Let’s turn to page 12 where we present components of growth on a segment basis. Q4 and full year segment results were generally in line with our expectations, as our strong storage rental revenue continues to exhibit durability. North American records and information management, or RIM, delivered positive storage rental internal growth and maintained strong adjusted OIBDA margins of 38.5% during the fourth quarter and the year. North American Data Management or DM delivered storage rental internal growth of 6% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the year. During the fourth quarter, the strong storage rental growth in DM more than offset the decline in service revenues, resulting in adjusted OIBDA expansion of 130 basis points. Declines in service revenues and Data Management continue to reflect the trends towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues, as our customers rotate their taste less frequently and the business becomes more archival. The International segment continued to generate attractive results, with 8% storage rental internal growth and 4% internal service revenue growth for the quarter. For the full year, storage rental internal growth was 6% and internal service revenue growth was 2%. The international business continued to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis in line with our mid 20s targets for the year. Adjusted OIBDA margins for the fourth quarter were impacted by costs related to continuous improvement in integration expenses and other IT project expenses. Let me direct you now to page 11, where we lay out our performance for the year against our guidance. We will cover this as a high level noting that constant dollar revenue and adjusted OIBDA were at the high end of our growth expectations. Our full year FFO and AFFO were also in line with our expectations, excluding the impact of FX. Our total distributions for the year, including the E&P purge or special distribution, were about $1.1 billion. Approximately $200 million was return of capital representing less than 20% of the total. It is common for a REIT to have some portion of its distributions characterized as return of capital, particularly in its initial year. In order to qualify as a REIT, it was critical that we purge our entire legacy E&P, including the E&P from our foreign QRS entities, before the end of 2014. We intentionally built the level of conservatism into our distribution estimates, as we did not want to risk on this distributing and filing to qualify. Also highlighted on this page, our investment and capital expenditures we have made during the year. Real estate investment of $200 million for the year is in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Our maintenance CapEx was $83 million at the low end of the guidance range. Non-real estate investment of $43 million was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This was driven by timing of certain IT investments, which will now occur in 2015. Acquisitions for the year were $189 million at the low end of our guidance range. Although the acquisition pipeline is large, we are very selective in the acquisitions that we undertake and we ensure that they are meeting our hurdle rates. Turning now to our outlook for 2015 on page 10, business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent. Operationally we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial objectives, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. That said, we have updated our 2015 guidance to reflect FX headwinds and our new constant currency rate, which was based on rates at the beginning of this year. We are projecting constant dollar revenue growth of 1% to 5% and growth in adjusted OIBDA of 1% to 5% in line with our strategic plan. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.30. To be clear, this guidance similar to the preliminary guidance we provided at the last earnings call reflects our anticipation of an absolute increase in total earnings in constant dollars offset on a per share basis by the impact of shares issued in connection with the special distribution and in addition the impact of FX. Driven by the consistent growth in our business and stable fundamentals, we expect normalized FFO to be between $425 million to $465 million, with AFFO between $480 million and $520 million. Please note that for 2015 guidance, we have deducted non-real estate investment from our AFFO calculation in response to constructive feedback. While not strictly maintenance related capital expense, these expenditures are necessary for us to support our RIET IT and customer interface systems and a somewhat recurring in nature. Therefore, we believe this change to our definition of AFFO is a more conservative approach. As you saw yesterday, we announced our first quarterly dividend for the year of $0.475 per share. We continue to believe that our cash flow supports our dividends at current levels and we expect our dividends to grow in line with operating performance. From a capital spend standpoint, we expect investment in real estate be to $230 million to $270 million, including investment in racking. Maintenance CapEx consistent with prior years is expected to be in the $70 million to $90 million range. Non-real estate investment is also expected to be in the $70 million to 90 million range, which is higher than recent years due to the inclusion of REIT compliance related CapEx and the timing of certain IT investments. Acquisition investments are expected to be $150 million to $250 million. It’s difficult to be precise here, as acquisitions are opportunistic in nature. We will update our outlook again on our Q1 earnings call to reflect any changes, if any, including the impact of any further changes up or down in FX. Shifting to the balance sheet, pages 26 and 27 present all debt maturity schedule and related metrics. At quarter end, we had liquidity of more than $700 million. As forecasted at our Investor Day last year, our lease adjusted leverage ratio would increase to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. In quarter end, it was 5.4 times as planned. At today's stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 36%. Turning now to REIT specific metrics on page 20, we provide our global real estate portfolio, which highlights our leased and owned facilities worldwide. The number of leased facilities increased slightly compared to the third quarter of 2014, as a result of our international acquisitions through which we assumed a few operating leases. As we begin to consolidate facilities and execute on our real estate purchase plan, we expect to increase the portion of owned facilities by a square footage. On page 21, we have provided storage net operating income, or NOI, per racked square foot, which highlights the attractive economics we derive from our real estate. We continue to achieve strong storage NOI from combined Records Management and Data Management of approximately $29 per racked square foot worldwide, due to the multiplier effects of renting our space by the cubic foot. This level compares favorably to NOI per square foot for most property types within the REIT sector. On page 22, our racking and building utilization rates are high and have improved slightly since the last quarter at 91% and 83% respectively for the Records Management portfolio. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about three years' time. On page 29, we have provided components of value, the summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA, excluding rent expense, in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis, whether leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. We think about our valuation as a REIT by applying the self-storage or industrial cap rates to our annualized NOI from our storage rental business. On top of the market value of our storage business, we add the value of the services business by applying appropriate multiple. We also provide other tangible assets, our current investments in buildings and racking, as well as the book value of recent acquisitions. We also provide liabilities, including our annual rent expense, to which we apply cap rate and deduct as another form of debt. We hope you find this disclosure useful. And as we've said in prior communications, we will continue to enhance our supplemental reporting and welcome feedback. With that, I will now turn the call back to Bill.
Bill Meaney: Thanks, Rod. Before we move to Q&A, I’d like to summarize this morning’s key points. Our 2014 financial results were on track with our expectations prior to the impact of foreign currency and in fact revenue on a constant dollar basis was at the top end of our range. Moreover, we look for similar constant dollar growth in 2015, consistent with the three-year plan we laid out at our Investor Day nearly a year ago. Our fourth quarter operating results demonstrated the success of our initiatives to drive volume in storage rental growth in both our developed and emerging markets and we’re maintaining momentum as we move into 2015. We have attractive high return investment opportunities in all of our segments, including potential acquisitions in developed and emerging markets, and interesting initiatives to leverage our enterprise storage rent through emerging business opportunities. We are maintaining our dividend in line with the growth in operating profit, which represents an attractive yield whilst providing cash flow to fund required CapEx and a portion of our growth investment. We’ll continue to maintain our capital allocation discipline. And like most REITs, we'll look forward -- we’ll look to fund external growth with new capital after first demonstrating our ability to generate the appropriate returns. Our business is durable and predictable and is characterized by attractive fundamentals compared with self-storage and industrial property types. While FX has been a drag in the recent quarter, we also see the current FX environment has an opportunity to take advantage of the strong U.S. dollar to increase our small but growing investment in the high growth emerging markets at favorable rate. With that, Operator, we're ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: At the internal growth in service up 3% and actually, I did catch also that, it was an easier comp? You mentioned even normalizing for the easier comp, this looks like a recovery? Could you go over some of the components of what drove a positive experience in North American service on an organic basis and looking into 2015, do you think this will be a volatile division or do you think that will be firming up?
Bill Meaney: Andrew, I think, you were slipped at the beginning. But, I think, your -- I don’t think we -- I hope we've got all of your, you are asking about the internal growth. And we called out the fact that we’re guiding for 2% to 2.5% and we had a very strong quarter. You want to understand how volatile that is and what drove the improvement. Is that correct?
Andrew Steinerman: On the service side of North American box
Bill Meaney: On the service side?
Andrew Steinerman: Yeah.
Bill Meaney: Okay. I think on the service side, I will let Rod talk you through because you also asked for the different components and I think I would say as an introductory mark before, Rod takes you through the different components of that? Because there as you know, there are multiple things in our service revenue, some of it is driven by paper prices. Some of it’s driven by the ins and outs associated with our Records Management business. There are different components that are more volatile and more in direct control of the operations. So, I think we have seen an improvement around our imaging business and paper prices and we have a new dedicated leader that’s just looking at our digital or scanning operations, so we have seen an improvement in that area. But we still see some of the underlying trends, especially in our Data Management area in terms of the some of the service associated with transport but Rod, you may want to talk about it in more detail.
Rod Day: Yeah. I think that’s right, Bill. The way I think about service revenue and I’m sure, I think you do as well is that service revenue that we can directly influence and this is more sort of independent, if you like from some of our core Records Management business and then there is service activity that is dependent on the activity of what’s going on within whole storage side. I think what was positive for us in Q4, we look at the first areas of the stuff that we can influence directly. We had a particularly good quarter in what we call projects. So that’s where we do specific assignments for customers to sort of help them more with Records Management issues and that was a good strong performance. In addition, we also have the benefit of a good shred performance during Q4, some of which was driven by an improved paper price that we’ve seen take-off bit in Q4. In terms of the activity associated with our records business within the RM side, although there was still a sort of modest decline, the decline is not as serious as we’ve seen. And so again, I think you know we were nervous about calling the bottom of that. But at least, it was a more favorable quarter than we’ve seen and actually follows on from Q3 in that regard. I think the contrast of that would be, as Bill said, within the DM side, we did see quite a significant drop in service activity associated with tight and sort of tight rotation. Now let’s talk about 2015. As Bill said, we’ve actually done a bit of reorganization on the service side, particularly within North America to give more focus to our scanning business and our shredding business, which I think will benefit us. And I would hope that within the RM side, although that’s probably still be continuing declines with activity associated with box, but that should be it and that would be at lower levels. But on the DM side, I do think we will continue to see quite significant reduction so. In terms of summary, in terms of the activity that we can control, I think will be -- I’m hoping for a good performance there on the stuff that is more difficult for us to control. RM more positive than it’s been. DM, I think will continue to struggle.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay.
Bill Meaney: The other thing I would add to that, Andrew, is on the DM side, there is a couple of initiatives that we are doing to try to mitigate that. First of all, we do have a new offering in Secure Destruction, which we are seeing, albeit off a small base but very rapid growth on that base. So, I think you'll start seeing that come through in some of the service numbers associated with the DM business. The other aspect is that we have taken a focus on maintaining and in some cases, trying to add additional volume and what we call our premium transport services around DM, which is dedicated transport. So there are couple puts and takes in initiatives that we've just started in last quarter, last year and we expect those to continue to come through. But the overall trend in DM, as it becomes more archival, like the box business. The DM business is a little bit behind in terms of the lifecycle of that.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.
Kevin McVeigh: A real nice job. Hey. Obviously, I don’t know if you can’t comment on Recall at all but they reported, they said there is further discussions, things like that. Just any update in terms of how you are thinking about that, Bill, particularly given the pullback in the Aussie dollar, does that impact, kind of the approach? And are there any milestones that as you think about the potential transaction from a timing perspective or is it just -- any update at all, if you can talk to it?
Bill Meaney: Thanks for that. I guess, Kevin, you probably expect -- I don't have much more to say than what my statement is that, we’ve obviously seen attractiveness of such a transaction, which is the reason why we put a proposal forward in December. And we look at different aspects of the business that is attracted by it. But it's really a question of whether or not we can get to a value that works for both sides. But I think I don't have any more to say than in my opening statement.
Kevin McVeigh: Okay. That's helpful. Hey. And just wondering, if I had a rate, it looks like on the initial ’15 guide, the internal growth was 1% to 2%. Now, we are saying two to two and a half percentage, is that right?
Rod Day: Say that again? I'm sorry.
Kevin McVeigh: I’m sorry. The internal growth overall in the 2015 guide, I thought initially was 1% to 2% and if I have it now, I think you bulk that up to two to two and a half percentage, is that right?
Rod Day: Yeah. I think just to be clear, there is probably a distinction between -- so if there is a distinction means total internal growth in storage, internal growth side. Bill referenced storage internal growth of being sort of 2% to 2.5%, which is kind of the number that we would expect for 2015, which is distinct from total revenue growth.
Kevin McVeigh: Got it. Because it seems like you are doing a really nice job there. And then just one other question in terms of -- with the drop in fuel, I know you had fuel surcharges, did that kind of work against you, so I guess it seems like the internal growth is probably even stronger than what you'd suggest if some of those surcharges were starting to runoff or Am I thinking about that incorrectly?
Rod Day: No, you're right actually. It does don't have an impact. It did have a relatively small impact to be honest in the backend of Q4. And it obviously doesn’t impact the EBITDA but it does impact the revenue slightly.
Kevin McVeigh: Okay. And then just one last and I apologize. I will get back to queue. It sounded like, Bill, you announced a major new customer. It doesn’t look like the CapEx from a racking perspective picked up. Was that a secured customer. or was that kind of an organic and any sense as to just what’s vertical that’s in?
Bill Meaney: I think you're referring to, is in relation to the Secure acquisition, I’d say it also helped us on-boarding a major new customer, is that what you are referring to, Kevin?
Kevin McVeigh: Yes.
Bill Meaney: Yeah. No, I think that -- well, it did help us a little bit in terms of the amount of CapEx for racking that we needed to deploy for that because we were able -- we bought Secure, they had some spare capacity in some of their other facilities, which we are able to use to onboard this new customer. So, I think that is true and that’s up in Canada.
Kevin McVeigh: Okay. Super. Thanks so much, nice job.
Bill Meaney: Thanks.
Rod Day: Thanks Kevin.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittman with Robert W. Baird.
Andy Wittman: Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to start by digging into some of the restructuring costs in fourth quarter. You may have said this on the conference call rather but I missed it. What were the restructuring costs this year and last year in 4Q specifically?
Rod Day: Okay.
Andy Wittman: Sorry, just want to get a sense of the comparability of the margins?
Rod Day: No. I got it here. So the restructuring charge for this year in Q4 was zero and for last year was $18.6 million.
Andy Wittman: Okay. So that implies that the margins are somewhat weaker here as we look at the segments, it looks like some of that was driven internationally, it looks like the guidance for next year takes a low end of the EBITDA or the OIBDA growth down a smidge? I guess, Bill, when you think about that, what’s the driver there, is that continue to be the international performance or is it something else? Could you help us understand that little bit better?
Bill Meaney: Well, I think that, if you look at our international performance is still in the range, though we said slightly below the 25% that we reported last year. But it really is dependent in terms of how we grow the emerging market portfolio, because it’s a -- it will ebb and flow as we add new countries into that portfolios. As we said before it’s -- you put something in the funnel and it grows to mimic U.S. margins, which are even much higher than the 25% that a year ago we reported in the international segment. So that will ebb and flow in that range as we actually add new investments as we build market leading positions in the various geographies on the emerging market portfolio.
Rod Day: Maybe, I’ll just make a comment on FX just, because that’s the difference if you’d like between the guidance, say we have approximately 40% of our revenues internationally and we’ve seen a 12% decrease in FX on those revenues across those basket of currencies, so as a kind of impacted around sort of 4%, 4.5%. So you can see that the scale of the issue if you like and that’s what’s -- that’s really the only thing that’s driven the change in guidance.
Andy Wittman: Got it. And then, just how much of the factor is pricing and I know several quarters ago now there were some large customers that you decided that wasn’t worth to loss the customer to keep down the churn, I think, that ultimately was, obviously, I think a smart decision? How much of that continued, Bill, and how much of pricing is maybe a factor in your margin performance?
Bill Meaney: It’s a good question, Andy. The pricing -- the beginning of the year, we probably weren’t as sophisticated as being into on pricing. In the middle of the year we hired a new person in-charge of pricing and we on boarded in November our new Chief Marketing Officer with that comes under. So we have seen during the course of the year being able to up our game in the pricing area. So this year, obviously, we turned around the performance in North America from a volume perspective. So that helps as well and we put those two together, which especially towards the second half of the year in terms of adding more sophistication and more horsepower in our pricing area, you put those two together and that’s why we feel pretty confident that, when we talked about internal storage revenue growth for next year in the 2% to 2.5% range. And if you recall, in quarter one last year we started off at 1.3%. So it’s been a nice trend and we've been building some momentum through the year, both on the volume side and now on the latter half of the year on the pricing side.
Andy Wittman: That’s really helpful. If I -- could you allow me one more question, I guess, this one to, Rod, on the capital structure. Debt-to-EBITDA now at 5.4 times, just wanted to get your sense of your comfort level there? I guess, last time we checked that was at the high-end or slightly above your targeted range? Is there been the change in the way you look at the range or is this really kind of staying there recognizing that you maybe able to get a lot more EBITDA, if you can come to terms with Recall, without having a lot of incremental debt, therefore taking you better into your targeted range that way? I just trying to understand, how you are thinking about that, if there's a need for fresh equity through a public offering, or if you feel like you are going to re-equitize the balance sheet through a deal and if that's, what’s preventing you from maybe reducing the leverage that way?
Rod Day: Actually, I don’t really want to talk about on sort of Recall and how that would may or may not impact things. Let me just talk about in isolations. I think the first point to say is that the leverage ratio of 5.4% is exactly what we predicted at our I Day presentations. So there’s actually no surprise in that. And we’ve landed in a preciosity of the point where we thought we would. But our stance is over the long-term -- a range of 4% to 5%, we think is optimal from a sort of cost of debt or cost of equity and trade off. But in terms of -- and raising any further record as Bill referenced in his remarks, we would do that on the basis of having compelling investments to make in a bid in acquisitions or in real estate in particular. Very, very common for a REIT, that’s the situation that we are in and that’s how we would look to fund things going forward.
Andy Wittman: Okay.
Rod Day: No, do you want to add on that, Bill?
Bill Meaney: I think that’s spot on.
Andy Wittman: That’s fine. Thanks guys for the answers.
Bill Meaney: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George Tong: If you look at Record Management volume growth this quarter ex-acquisition, it was relatively consistent on a quarter-over-quarter basis. But if you look at the fourth quarter organic storage revenue growth, it accelerated from 2.2% to 3.5%, given the volume growth was consistent on a quarter-to-quarter basis, is the different essentially coming from stronger pricing trend?
Rod Day: Yes. That’s good. There was actually a slight improvement in terms of our volume growth quarter-on-quarter. But you are right and George, it doesn’t explain the full difference by any means. Two things that are going on. One, we benefit from relatively weak compared to last year because as you may recall on our earnings call this time last year, we were talking about a number, sort of pricing adjustments down with what we have to make during that period. So in a sense, the sort of the year-on-year comparison and it slightly falls. But even if you strip that out, we have seen an improvement, a disproportionate improvement relative to our volume. And that comes back to -- in terms of the overall mix price and that’s what Bill was referencing earlier in terms of our ability, if you like to get more pricing traction than we’ve been able to do and maybe earlier in the year.
Bill Meaney: Yeah. No, I think that’s right. So as you called out, we started off Q1 at a storage rental internal revenue growth of 1.4%. We ended up the year at 3.5%. As you say, even if you correct other things that Rod’s talking about, you were in the upper half of the 2s in terms of internal revenue storage growth rates. So, we've seen a really nice trend in pick up during that area. I think we also guided at the beginning of the year that we were -- we did call out that we were underperforming and we are very comfortable that we could get to the 2% to 2.5% range and we think we’ll be able to continue that momentum this year. And just to pick you up on one other thing is that, we have seen a nice progression in terms of the volume growth, the storage volume growth over the last say two years where we've gone from Q1 in 2013 in terms of internal storage volume growth before acquisitions of 1.1% net growth and we progressed up to this last quarter of 1.9% growth. So, we've seen a very nice expansion and that's really been driven by both better offense and defense in terms of retaining customers and also gaining new customers, so we feel like things are starting to come together. So, we feel pretty confident that we'll be able maintain that momentum into 2015.
George Tong: Great. That’s helpful. And last quarter your C dollar OIBDA growth was indicated to be 2% to 5%, while this quarter the range was widened to 1% to 5%. Can you talk about how your views on margins have evolved over the past quarter?
Rod Day: Really, no material shift other than the issue of FX, as I was referencing earlier so and that's really the only change that we have to our thinking.
George Tong: Okay. And then last question for me. Real estate acquisitions, I think in the past you've indicated, they will be largely funded by ATM offering, which is typical of RIETs. Can you discuss returns you’ve seen from recent real estate acquisitions you’ve done and what the plan is for 2015?
Bill Meaney: Yes. So in terms of the returns that we would expect from acquisitions, I would distinguish between acquisitions that we make in developed markets and acquisitions that we make in emerging markets. And given the sort of the risk profile within emerging markets, we look for higher returns than we would expect than in developed markets. The range that we look for is 9% to 11%, so that the -- I'm always worried about quoting averages here because each day when we look at on a case-by-case basis and risks adjusts and make sure that we’re getting good quality returns on a case-by-case basis. The average is 9% to 11% typically higher in emerging and it is easier to take lower returns in developed where it’s more predictable.
George Tong: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Good morning. Could you -- it looks to me that the service revenues -- just following up on Andrew’s question, it is better than it’s been in a very long time. Can you give us just the organic services revenue in North America in aggregate, was it positive?
Rod Day: The North American service revenue for the quarter, Andrew, or just for the year?
Shlomo Rosenbaum: For the quarter. For the quarter.
Bill Meaney: Sorry. Yeah, definitely. On a constant currency rate, we are at 2.4% in the Records Management, which is a good performance. But we have seen a decline of 4.2% in Data Management but certainly in the North American space that was a strong -- sorry, the RIM space that was strong performances compared to where we’ve been.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: If I put them together, North American general services is positive now?
Bill Meaney: Yes.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Very good. And then what’s going on in the U.S. government market. You guys added some capacity, I saw in news like a month ago. Is the government right to go after that really huge market that you guys have been talking about for years?
Bill Meaney: Yeah. Shlomo, I think it is a good question. And you probably also noticed, I think we had a press release just a couple of weeks ago that we had a new head of federal who has a wide of depth and experience in that that area. We have as you know that we invest when we can see the revenue coming. And I think we feel like we’re getting pretty close on a number of discussions with the federal government and we still see that has a very big unvented opportunity for us. So yes we are and it’s probably little bit overstated to say we’re bullish but we feel that we're building momentum in that vertical. And we’re really pleased by how fast our new leader of the federal business seems to be getting his feet under the desk.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Great. And then middle-market, any update over there in terms of kind of a strategy post the acquisition you made a little while ago?
Bill Meaney: I think that the -- on a Cornerstone acquisition, which I think you’re referring to, we talked about that we’re getting some of the D&A to go after that market. We do think that that's a real opportunity for us because as I think I’ve said before is our market share or representation in that market is almost a quarter of what it is in the large enterprise market. And that is the market that tends to have better internal growth rates among themselves and good pricing. So that is an area where we have taken some of the D&A from Cornerstone and we have some of our folks working on how to better go after that. And also the reorganization that we did a year ago is already starting to show some benefit in terms of better penetrating that market and that was breaking -- getting the feel people aligned with the local territories much tighter. So I would say we’re still in the early part of the game on that, but we're starting to see -- we definitely see the opportunity and we’re starting to slowly see some results in that area.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And this is for Rod. Just going and looking at a kind of change in the AFFO calculation. Is this $70 million that you moved out of AFFO because some focus somewhat more recurring, is that non-real estate investment correct line on slide 10?
Rod Day: That’s correct. That’s exactly right. And just to get a little bit history on that, we were talking to a number of REIT investors and there was kind of confusion around what’s maintenance for a company like us. So we’ve always had the real estate maintenance expense within our AFFO and following feedback, we thought it was appropriate to include this additional spend which is generally sort of recurring in nature. And therefore it gets sort of more conservative and more prudent view of what the AFFO number should be.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: So is there a difference between the $70 million that came down in the $70 million to $90 million range?
Rod Day: So I don’t ….
Shlomo Rosenbaum: In other words, if I take AFFO in the old definition to the new definition, it’s down $70 million but the range of $70 million to $90 million. Is there an improvement somewhere else?
Rod Day: No. No that’s the only adjustment.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Would you mind just walking us through kind of sources and uses for next year? From starting with an AFFO that should be roughly $500 million and I take kind of the midpoint of real estate investment, maintenance CapEx, business and customer acquisitions. I netted out on the $500 million and I would go to issue about negative $30 million, use about $400 million of dividends. Is there -- there is clearly you have about $600 million of liquidity, if you pulled that all with debt you kind of bump out of our debt. How should we think of it from a modeling perspective?
Rod Day: I think while I draw that, try my best for the case that would be long sort of detailed analysis. If we could do that offline, very happy to do that but it will take quite some time to work that through with you.
Shlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. I appreciate it. I’ll take your appointment. Thank you very much.
Bill Meaney: Bye.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Dan Dolev for Jefferies.
Dan Dolev: My question, I won’t take step back and kind of look at the last few years and ask you if I look at the last three years you spend about all-in $1.5 billion in CapEx. And if I look at the EBITDA progression, so called since 2011, it’s down about 2.5%. So what kind of return were you aiming to get on the CapEx and why isn’t EBITDA growing if you did get return on that CapEx? Thanks.
Rod Day: I think that what you disentangle is Sort of what’s been going on with the some of the underlying performance of the business, certainly in the sort of ‘11 and ‘12 period and the returns that we’re getting from the CapEx that we spend. So during the sort of the ‘11 and ‘12 period, the two things were happening. And one is we had a sort of poor performance on our services side of the business but it impacts our business negatively. And the second is depending on which EBITDA you’re looking at, we’re investing in REIT costs which obviously has the benefit further down the P&L in terms of tax. And if you then just strip out the CapEx, the investments that we’ve made. The typical returns we look to get on those certainly in excess of our WAC which is 8% and obviously that will vary depending on the secured investment that we are making. But then if you sort of layer them back on top, that will then contribute in a positive way to EBITDA.
Dan Dolev: Okay. Understood.
Bill Meaney: Okay.
Dan Dolev: And one last follow up, on the dividend, you sounded a little bit more reserve, if I understood correctly on ’15 dividend? Are you still committed to $4.10 to $4.20?
Rod Day: I think, we are -- so the reason why we gave the -- this is a dollar guidance in the previous quarter, was really because there was so much going on with the dividend, with special projects and an E&P projects and special payments. And we are happy that we were getting questions coming in from investors because it was quite a confusing pitch. So we thought that would be helpful number to put out. Now we are through all that. We will just go, I don’t know sort of quarterly basis in terms of our per dividends payment. So, I think Bill, referenced in his remarks. Our policy like is to grow that dividends in line with our operating performance and that’s what we were doing.
Bill Meaney: Yeah. That the only I was just saying, I think, we are -- I think it’s also clear, where we are guiding now is on a per share basis and I think I kind of fumbled over cents whatever, but its $47.5 of per share is what we are guiding over and that, as Rod said, grows in line with operating income, because we are now through the project. I think, with that, I’d like to turn it back over to the operator.
Operator: And at this time, I will turn it back over to Bill Meaney for closing remarks.
Bill Meaney: Yeah. I think I have already done the remarks, Operator. So I just want to thank you all for joining us this morning for our call and we look forward to speaking to you in three months.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Tasha [ph], and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q3 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Melissa Marsden: Thank you, Tasha [ph], and welcome everyone to our Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and our progress towards strategic initiatives; followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results and discuss portions of our supplemental reporting package. After our prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2014 and 2015 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, earnings commentary, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, are included in this supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William L. Meaney: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, with progress over -- on our 3-year strategic plan and other important initiatives. During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our performance in the developed markets, further expanded the portion of our business from faster-growing emerging markets, increased the momentum in our emerging business segment and accelerated our real estate purchase program. We also declared our first regular quarterly dividend as a REIT in the remainder of our EMP distribution, resulting in a substantial payout to stockholders. Our financial results for the quarter continued to reflect some noise related to our REIT conversion. I'll touch on the highlights, and Rod will address the specifics in a few minutes. Total revenue for the quarter was $783 million, up 3.9% on a constant dollar basis, in line with our 3-year plan to achieve 4% compounded annual growth. Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS were both impacted by restructuring charges as well as ongoing REIT compliance costs, which were not in last year's numbers. Turning to the operating highlights. Total storage rental revenue, a key economic driver of our business, was up 5.6% in constant dollars, driven by strong growth of 12.5% in our international business, 3.3% in North American Records and Information Management and 1.9% growth in Data Management. Strong storage rental growth in the third quarter reflects our focus on driving net positive storage rental volume growth in developed markets. Year-to-date, we added 3.7 million cubic feet, net of acquisitions, or 0.8% volume growth. Of this amount, North America alone was positive 1.6 million cubic feet. We also continued to improve retention with further reductions in customer terminations and permanent withdrawals in North America, bringing total volume outflows down to 6.3% from 6.6% in the second quarter. The combination of improved customer retention, together with internal and new sales, has yielded North America the positive internal volume growth of 1.6 million cubic feet referenced above. These trends underscore the durability of our high-return business in the mature, developed markets, which remain fragmented with significant unvended potential, and the success of our targeted sales and customer retention initiatives. Turning to emerging market performance. As of the end of the third quarter, we now have 12.2% of total revenue coming from these high-growth markets, up from 10.5% at the beginning of the year, progressing nicely towards our goal of 16% by the end of 2016. Emerging market internal storage rental growth -- revenue growth was 10% in the third quarter, driven by internal volume growth of 9%. Including acquisition gains, volume growth was 19% in the emerging markets. Acquisitions continued to be an integral part of our strategy with particular emphasis on high-growth emerging markets. Since our last quarterly report, we closed on the acquisition of Keepers Brazil, our fourth acquisition there in the last 2 years. Brazil's record management market is expected to continue to grow in the high single digits annually for the next 3 to 5 years, and we are achieving steady improvement in profits and returns as we continue to enhance our leadership position. We also anticipate further enhancement as we shift operations to our new campus in Hortolândia, near São Paulo, over the next few years. Additionally, in Eastern Europe, we bought out the vast majority of our JV partners' interest in Serbia, Denmark, Russia and the Ukraine, and we acquired ALCZ, a provider of records management services in the Czech Republic, increasing the size of our business there by some 15%. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities in emerging markets with more than 4x the coverage needed to achieve our goal of having at least 16% of our sales from emerging markets by 2016. We continue to evaluate acquisitions in terms of how they can both further our market leadership and sustain the durability of our business, after first establishing that we can exceed our cost to capital and achieve our targeted returns. Within our emerging business opportunity area, we continue to experience good momentum in our data center operations. We will invest roughly $27 million this year to expand capacity by 25%, and deliver the space related to bookings in our Pennsylvania underground facility, where more than 90% of the inventory space is contracted. We also signed our first few deals in the initial phase of our new aboveground facility in Boston, and have a pipeline of about 3x our initial capacity. Our year-to-date investment in this business is about $19 million, and we plan to invest another $16 million or so in the fourth quarter to accommodate capacity requirements in the underground facility. As we've noted in the past, we will invest in our data center business based on customer wins. Another strategic goal as a REIT is our plan to own more of our real estate over time and continue to optimize our portfolio. Since the beginning of the year, we've bought in or have under contract more than 700,000 square feet of space, including properties in Colorado, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Virginia as well as one building in Cork, Ireland. Our primary focus, however, will be on U.S. properties, where we have a total of 22.5 million square feet of purchase opportunity. Moreover, through purchase options, we have a clear path towards ownership of an additional 3.4 million square feet. Execution of these options would shift our own percentage by about 5 points, implying that together with the recent purchases, our owned or controlled portfolio of real estate represents approximately 40% of our total. Expected unlevered IRRs, or internal rates of return, on properties purchased to date are between 9% and 12%. It's important to note that we also have a substantial portion of our properties covered by attractive lease rates, given the long-term nature of those lease arrangements, so those will generally not be part of early purchase consideration. We also disposed of some older properties and will continue to prune the portfolio to maximize the value of our real estate holdings. In other REIT-related developments, we declared both our first regular quarterly dividend of $0.475 per share and a special distribution of $3.62 per share, representing the remainder of the EMP purge to be distributed 80% in stock and up to 20% in cash. As you may know, the 3-day pricing period for the special distribution ended last night, resulting in an average price of $35.55 per share. As a result, we expect to issue approximately 15.7 million shares, bringing our total outstanding to 209 million shares. Our quarterly dividend rate was based on an assumption of 209 million shares outstanding following the stock dividend. Subject to board approval, we expect to declare and pay another regular quarterly dividend of $0.475 per share in December. We also expect to declare and pay a catch-up dividend, which will represent the remainder of the total $400 million of ordinary dividends to be distributed in 2014. We don't yet know that precise per share rate, but we expect to outline the remaining 2014 payments later in November. These dividend payments are significant as they represent the culmination of our conversion to a REIT and demonstrate our commitment to enhancing stockholder returns through attractive payouts and steady long-term cash flow growth. At our current payout rate, in yesterday's share price, our dividend represents a 5.3% yield, well in excess of most REITs, and supports our goal to deliver total shareholder returns in excess of the 8% to 9% TSR, or total shareholder return, of the S&P 500. Combining our current yield of 5.3% with our expected adjusted OIBDA growth of approximately 4% results in a TSR for Iron Mountain of over 9% prior to dividend reinvestment and also before we add potential upside from additional emerging business opportunities. Importantly, the REIT structure is consistent with our capital allocation goals and does not limit our ability to fund our business plan. After maintenance and IT-related CapEx and the dividend, we retained enough cash to support investment associated with internal growth in our core business. As we become more active with acquisitions and the purchase of real estate, we expect to fund that incremental investment with additional borrowing or equity issuance, similar to the manner in which most REITs fund external growth. As we've said from the beginning of the process, our business is well-suited to the REIT structure due to our sizable real estate portfolio and our attractive business model, through which we incur occupancy costs on a square-foot basis but generate storage rental revenue on a cubic foot basis. This significant spread between our costs and our return on investment generates high net operating income per square foot and is core to how we create value for our stockholders. We also distinguish ourselves through low-maintenance CapEx and low turnover costs per square foot. We have no TIs, or tenant improvements, required if a customer terminates, and we bring in another customer's records. We also have a low customer churn of less than 2% per annum, as well as excellent customer credit quality, given our service to 950 of the Fortune 1000. Due to the 15-year average life of a box in our storage facilities, we also have very low volatility in the growth of our storage rental business even during turbulent economic cycles. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod.
Roderick Day: Thanks, Bill. We continue to be pleased with our operating performance. We had a solid third quarter, anchored by storage rental and improving volume growth as well as benefits from acquisitions in emerging and developed markets. I will begin today with an overview of our third quarter financial performance, followed by an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year, and a preliminary outlook for 2015. I will then address our capital deployment activities and conclude with a discussion of various REIT metrics. As a reminder, we now provide all of our financial disclosures and the earnings commentary in one comprehensive supplemental reporting package. I will be referring to certain pages of this package throughout my remarks. Turning to our financial results for the quarter. Let me direct you to financial highlights on Page 8. Supported by strong storage rental growth, total reported revenues were $783 million for the quarter, up approximately 4% compared with $755 million in 2013. Adjusted OIBDA declined by approximately 2%, reflecting ongoing REIT compliance costs as well as acquisition-related costs when compared to prior year. Year-to-date adjusted OIBDA increased by 1%, which includes $3.5 million of costs associated with our 2013 restructuring and approximately $8 million of REIT compliance costs. For comparison, adjusted OIBDA for the first 9 months of 2013 included $5 million in restructuring charges. Adjusted EPS of $0.35 is consistent with our annual guidance. For the quarter, it would have been $0.40 prior to a $0.02 impact from ongoing REIT compliance costs and $0.03 impact from depreciation and amortization related to REIT CapEx and investments. Additionally, EPS for 2013 was restated to be on a comparable basis using our structural tax rate of roughly 15%. Similarly, our structural tax rate for year-to-date 2014 came out to 16%. We continue to believe our tax rate will be roughly in the same range over the long term. On a GAAP basis, net income was impacted by approximately $40 million tax provision, which represents the revisions or estimates made in the second quarter for the reversal of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the REIT conversion and taxes related to foreign repatriation. Also highlighted on this page are investment and capital expenditures. Year-to-date maintenance CapEx of roughly $45 million is on a run rate to be below our $80 million to $100 million full year guidance range. However, we typically see the majority of capital improvement projects undertaken in the latter portion of the year. Other CapEx of $33 million is roughly in line with the $50 million midpoint of our full year guidance, and real estate investment of $145 million, which includes racking, is on track with our full year expectation of around $200 million. As Bill noted, we are accelerating our efforts to own more of our real estate over time, and you can track the changes to our global real estate portfolio on Page 19. Over the long term, we believe that the purchase of our real estate will create value for our shareholders. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by solid storage rental revenue growth. On Page 9, looking at the top line growth for the quarter on a constant dollar basis, revenue is up 3.9%, reflecting solid storage rental revenue gains of 5.6% and service revenue growth of 1.3%. The growth in service revenue was driven by recent acquisitions and increases in imaging projects. On a constant dollar basis, year-to-date total revenue growth was 4.3%, driven by storage rental revenue gains of 5.5% and service revenue growth of 2.6%. Also on the same page, we show total worldwide volume growth. We continue to demonstrate improvement in net volume growth in Records Management with total year-on-year volume growth in the quarter of 5.5% including acquisitions, or 1.8% excluding acquisitions. Volume trends remain consistent with prior quarters, demonstrating stable incoming volume from existing customers, important additional contributions from acquisitions and further improvements in the level of terminations and withdrawals. Let's turn to Page 11, where we present components of growth on a segment basis. Q3 segment results were generally in line with our expectations, as our storage rental revenue continues to exhibit durability. North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, delivered positive storage rental internal growth and adjusted OIBDA expansion of 160 basis points to 39.5%. North American Data Management, or DM, delivered storage rental internal growth of 1.4%. However, the decline in service revenues in the DM business drove adjusted OIBDA margins for this segment down for the quarter. That said, DM remains a high-margin business of 56.2%. Declines in service revenues continue to reflect the trends towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues as our customers rotate their tapes less frequently and the biggest business becomes more archival. The International segment continued to generate attractive results with 6.8% storage rental internal growth. Internal service revenue growth for this segment declined by approximately 1.5%, primarily due to the reduction in nonrecurring customer projects. The International business continued to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis, in line with our mid-20s targets, with adjusted OIBDA margins of 24.5% year-to-date. Finally, Corporate and Other revenue was up about 10%, reflecting growth in data-centric service revenues. As Bill noted, we are making good progress, and we expect to end the year near a $20 million revenue run rate. Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of 2014 and preliminary guidance for 2015, on Page 10. Our business trends and operating fundamentals remain consistent, and we are on track to achieve our financial goals for 2014. Therefore, we are maintaining the majority of our 2014 guidance whilst tightening some of our ranges. That said, we have made 2 changes to our guidance that impact earnings per share. The first relates to the partial year impact of new shares that will be issued as a result of the special distribution. This will obviously impact our per-share metrics. The second relates to foreign exchange pressures. For the first half of the year, modest pressures from FX were offset by contribution from acquisitions and consistent core performance, which allowed us to remain comfortable within our previous ranges. However, as we have progressed through the year, we have witnessed further material strengthening of the dollar, which is outweighing the benefit from acquisitions and consistent performance. In the light of these recent changes, it is prudent to adjust for the known currency impact at this time. So as a result of the stock distribution and the impact of the foreign currency exchange rates, we have reduced adjusted EPS guidance for 2014 to $1.33 to $1.44 from our current range of $1.37 to $1.52. In addition, normalized FFO per share will be reduced to $2.21 to $2.46 from the current range of $2.25 to $2.51. Moving on to our preliminary guidance for 2015. From an operational standpoint, we believe we are on track to deliver our long-term goals, given the durability and strong fundamentals of our business. We are projecting constant dollar revenue growth of 1% to 5% and growth in adjusted OIBDA of 2% to 5%, in line with our strategic plan. Please note these growth ranges are in constant dollars based on our 2014 budget constant dollar rates. If the dollar remains strong, the current estimated impact on revenue and contribution could be at 100 to 150 basis points. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.38 for 2015. To be clear, this guidance reflects an anticipation of an absolute increase in total earnings in constant dollars, offset on a per-share basis by the impact of the additional 15.8 million shares issued in connection with the special distribution. Driven by the consistent growth in our business and stable fundamentals, we expect normalized FFO to be between $440 million and $480 million, with AFFO between $570 million and $610 million. And, in addition, we anticipate that our dividend growth will continue to be in line with contribution growth. From a CapEx standpoint, we expect to maintain level spend on maintenance CapEx and acquisitions, although we anticipate an uptick in real estate investment driven by our purchase plan. We will update our outlook again on our Q4 earnings call to reflect changes, if any, including the impact of FX. Shifting to the balance sheet. Pages 25 and 26 present our debt maturity schedule and related metrics. At quarter end, we had liquidity of about $1.2 million. Our total lease-adjusted leverage ratio of 5.2x has increased over the past 3 years, as planned, to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. At today's stock price, our debt to total market capitalization is roughly 36%. We continue to shift our debt financing to international markets. In addition to having our expenses denominated in local currencies, we have long-dated bonds in Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, euro and more currencies available under our credit facility. This provides a natural foreign exchange hedge to support our growth in international markets and reduce taxable income in local jurisdictions. In September, we issued the equivalent of about GBP 400 million in a private pounds sterling fed offering in the U.K., and established a line of credit in Brazil to support our growth. Turning now to REIT-specific metrics on Page 20. We have provided storage NOI per racked square foot, which highlights the attractive economics we derive from our real estate for both our RM and DP businesses. We continue to achieve storage NOI in excess of $21 per square foot, amongst the highest in the REIT sector. On Page 21, our racking and building utilization rates remain high and in line with prior quarter at 91% and 83%, respectively. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum racking utilization is in the mid-90s. When we enter into a new facility, we generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years' time. On Page 28, we have provided components of value, a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. As a reminder, we present both storage NOI and service OIBDA excluding rent expense in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis whether leased or owned. To balance that, we provide total rent expense in the liabilities area. Finally, we are currently showing investment in buildings, racking and acquisition at book value, but it's our intent ultimately to provide a schedule of these investment categories with our expected returns. As we have stated in the past, we will continue to enhance our supplemental reporting, and we welcome your feedback. So, in summary, Q3 was a solid quarter, consistent with prior performance and supported by a sustained storage rental performance, stable profitability on our North American segments and strong international and emerging market performance. I will now hand the call back to Bill.
William L. Meaney: Thanks, Rod. And before we move to Q&A, I'd like to sum up by saying that despite some noise this quarter due to one-offs and aligning ourselves as a REIT, we are in line with our expectations and consistent with the strategic plan we laid out at Investor Day. The fundamentals are important, and we're pleased with the positive momentum we're seeing in the business. More specifically, we are driving volume in storage rental across both developed and emerging markets, we're shifting our revenue mix to faster growing emerging markets, and we're executing on attractive acquisitions and focusing on building scale, particularly given the highly fragmented nature of the markets we operate in. Our momentum leading into 2015 is strong. Our storage rental revenue internal growth accelerated to 2.2% in the third quarter, having started the year in the first quarter at 1.4%. In addition to continue strong internal volume growth in our Emerging Markets of 9%, we added 3.7 million cubic feet of internal growth in our developed markets as well, and added 1.6 million cubic feet in North America alone. In our emerging business area, we expanded capacity in the data center business by 25%, and more than 90% of the inventory space is contracted. And we've added another 700,000 square feet to our owned real estate portfolio at unlevered returns between 9% and 12%. 2015 preliminary guidance calls for similar growth in operating performance and adjusted OIBDA, although we anticipate some reported revenue headwinds due to the continued strengthening of the dollar. We expect consistent trends for durable storage rental revenue in developed markets, and are on track to continue to make emerging markets a more significant portion of our overall sales mix. And we continue to identify and incubate new business opportunities that are complementary to our core business. We believe the culmination of these key drivers in steady growth in earnings and AFFO, consistent with our [indiscernible] day projections and related growth in our dividend. With that, Operator, we're ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wanted to dive into the acceleration of the internal storage revenue growth. Obviously, it was very encouraging, but the service revenue was down more. And my question is, aren't these 2 sort of tied, like fewer destructions means less service revenues, which helps accelerate internal storage? And of course, storage is a better business. And so when you put that all together, I see you're looking for 1% to 2% internal for 2015. I assume you think that service will be kind of stable or positive to get there. So just help me with the confluence between service and storage internal revenue growth in the quarter and how it frames your 2015 comments.
William L. Meaney: So let me start, Andrew, and then I'll let Rod chime in on it. I mean, first of all, the thing you're highlighting is part of the story, but I think it's only part of the story. I think if you actually look at our service revenue, is in the data management space or our tape business, that's where we've seen more of an acceleration or a continued increase in terms of the drop in service revenue. It's starting to slow down, but that's the area which probably started a little bit after the drop in service revenue in our box business, but is still continuing, whereas in the box business, we do see more stability. Some of it is a reduction in destructions because there is some -- as we said last time on the call, there's some choppiness in terms of the way legal holds come in and out in terms of when things are queued up for destruction. But also, a part of the story is the data management business. So we feel good where we're guiding in terms of the overall growth in storage rental, and I think we said at the beginning of the year, we expected to get back into the 2s, and we've achieved that. So we feel like we're set up for good momentum next year, but I think it is important to call out that in our data management business, we continue to see a decline in service as that business becomes more and more archival. And then Rod, if you want to add anything?
Roderick Day: Yes. I mean, Andrew, obviously, there's a small sort of relationship between lower destructions and then impacting service revenues. So we're not hiding from that, but it's not really what's explaining what's going on in service. And just on that particular point, clearly, we'd rather have the queues given the sort of the perpetuity value of them than take the destruction revenue. So in terms of long-term value for the business, it's clearly a trade-off that we'd want to make. In terms of looking to 2015 and sort of answering that part of your question, what we're expecting within the numbers, certainly, we expect to sort of maintain the improved and good performance I think we're now seeing on the storage side. We're not expecting a sort of radical turnaround in service by any means, but we would expect to see some more modest improvements, particularly in areas such as our imaging business, which is actually showing reasonable progress this year at reasonable margins as well. So areas like that we're looking into to see what we can do to continue to drive performance. So hopefully that answers your question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: On the service question. I'm curious about the special projects. Could you talk about what you're seeing, ebbs and flows there, and what your outlook is going forward for how meaningful those will be?
William L. Meaney: I think that -- Scott, I think, these are -- they are large, specific projects. Sometimes they are consulting projects, when we are bringing a new customers in, there's a number of things that they want to look at in terms of cleaning up some of their processes or digitizing parts of their inventory. So it's everything from bringing in new customers and some of the costs associated with that from their standpoint, to one-off projects again, where customers are going through a major cleanup or digitization of some of their records. So it's one of those areas which is probably the more difficult to guide for, because it's something that is usually driven by customer relationships and specific asks on their part. So it is something that we market for, but it's something that is hard to predict.
Roderick Day: And I think that's right, and actually, it can be a little bit lumpy. I mean, our business is obviously pretty predicable when compared to most businesses. But in Q3 last year, we actually had quite a large project in the data management space that kind of impacted some of our comparables. But they can be profitable lines of activity for us, so we'd expect to continue doing them, but they can sort of jump around a little bit quarter to quarter.
William L. Meaney: And the only thing I would add to that is we expect that and it is -- you can think of it as also a -- it's a marketing expense that has a very nice profit associated with it in terms of either maintaining a strong customer relationship as a way we differentiate ourselves with our customers, or, as I said earlier, in terms of getting a customer in, but it is also an area where we're able to variabilize our cost base. So it's something that we can preserve the margins, even though you have this lumpiness, but it's very much part of why we -- our revenue is so sticky, because we're able to provide these additional services to our customers when they need it.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: . Now I may have missed this. Did you indicate your expectation within guidance for paper prices in 2015?
Roderick Day: I didn't actually say anything on that, but our expectation would be for it to be flat year-over-year.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then could you address swing factors with regard to high end, low end of guidance range for 2015? I imagine that the sizable acquisition pipeline will contribute there, but -- to the high end or the low end. But could you talk to some other drivers you think that will be meaningful in swinging the variance?
Roderick Day: Well, certainly, as you say, acquisitions, both in terms of the rate at which we bring on businesses and the speed at which we're able to integrate them have an impact. And for sure -- and as we look to next year, FX is going to be an issue. We've seen, as I was saying in the remarks earlier, that the dollar has strengthened, particularly over the last month or so. Clearly, that could get stronger, it could get weaker, and so we're studying that closely, and we'd look to update guidance at the beginning of next year as regards to FX, but that is an issue just given the sort of the global nature of our business. And you mentioned the shreds paper price, that's always a volatility that we have to manage. And another one within that for us will be our DMS scanning business, which has a sort of project component to it. To sort of build on the conversation we were talking about earlier, is that we are making reasonable progress actually in that area at the moment, and we -- obviously, we hope to continue to do so. But that's another item that can move.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And then just one final one for me. Are you content with the size of the sales force you have, where they're focused, where they're located? Any major internal initiatives on that front into 2015?
William L. Meaney: I think we are -- I think on that point is that where our investment on the sales force is less on organization and reorg. We think the reorganization we did last year to get them much more in tune and closer to the market. Because as I said in my remarks, our market is still very fragmented, so we wanted to make sure that we were aligning the sales force with those real opportunities and unvended opportunities are. I think our focus this year now is less on the reorganization, because we think we've got that right, but more on the training in performance management of the sales force. So that's really the focus, and so we think we've got the right numbers, we've got them in the right places, and now it's about equipping them from a training in performance management standpoint.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
 Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Going deeper into the storage business, can you map out how you expect volume and pricing trends to play out in your various geographies and what implications that will mean for future internal storage growth trends?
William L. Meaney: I think that the -- let me kind of back up and just highlight kind of the journey that we're on. So if you look at, say, a year ago, pretty much all of '13, you would see if we net out acquisitions, then you would have about 1.1% growth rate in terms of net incoming volume on the storage business, or on the box business, right? And if you look at where -- if you look at '14, I mean -- yes, '14, during that same period, you'll see that we've trended up from 1.5% net volume internal growth rate to this latest quarter of 1.8%. So, if you think about it, we've added 70 bps over the course of the year in terms of our internal growth rate. So if you're seeing -- and then at the same time, you see what we've done on the revenue side, as we said, we started off at 1.4% in terms of storage internal growth rate, in terms of revenue, and we're up to 2.2%. What we see going forward is, and it kind of relates to the last question from Scott in terms of what we're doing with our sales force, is we really do think now that we've got the sales force organized in the right buckets and looking at the right opportunities is -- and now we're spending -- investing a lot more money and time in terms of the training in performance management of that sales force. So, what we would see is that continued trend going forward. We do think that, from a pricing standpoint, as we start going into some of the unvended areas, we would expect that we could continue the type of performance that we've got in the latest quarter. So that's -- and that's really what we're focused on right now, and we're seeing that. And when you ask about geographies, the big part of that growth, that 70 basis points of growth that I've highlighted in terms of across our business, has been mainly -- the improvements mainly come out of -- or the deltas come out of the developed market. So a lot of this realignment of the sales force has been focused at the developed market, which is far from being dead, because I said it's still -- we find the developed markets, when we really got into it, is much more fragmented and much more unvended than we previously suspected. So we would expect to be able to continue the kind of performance that we saw in the third quarter going forward into '15.
 Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Very helpful, Bill. And then on the services side, can you provide some additional color on the rate at which services trends are stabilizing? Any positive or negative catalyst that can move the needle with services?
William L. Meaney: Let me just stay high level. I'm going to let Rod comment in a little bit more in detail. I think that it's a tale of 2 -- let's take 3 different components of looking at the services. The one part on the box side of the business, which I think we've been calling out for the last couple of quarters, we see a flattening out of that. In other words, that business is becoming more archival, but we see kind of a stabilization in terms of the service rates that we're getting in that business, and we've been very successful in terms of stripping out costs as that business is becoming more archival. So we've got a good match between our costs and our activities in the box business, and we see a flattening out of that decline. If we look in the data management business, is we see continued single-digit decline, but significant single-digit decline in that business over time, then we're able to reduce costs in line with that. But we think that, if we look at it, we think the data management business, or the tape business, is a little bit behind in the life cycle in terms of trending towards the archival side of the business. So I think we're in the earlier part of the game, if you will, in terms of that flattening out. So I wouldn't call that as a flattening-out trend yet, but we're able to manage it from a margin standpoint. And then the third bucket is really some of the things that we were referring to before, is the DMS or, in some places we call it BPM-type processes, and there, there's 2 parts of it. There is what I would call the ones that are much more long-contracted, embedded part of the process with our customers, and these are multiyear contracts, where it's kind of an ongoing trend. And then we have some of these large projects, which are usually associated with a change or a specific need for the customers. But I don't know, Rod, if you want to comment in more detail?
Roderick Day: I don't know, I think you've hit on the sort of the key dynamics that we see. I suppose that the other point I would make is within services, where we have the shredding business as well, which is performing this year. But as I was saying earlier, the importance of paper price can sort of swing that up or down. It's actually been pretty stable this year. But I think in terms of the sort of the fundamental dynamics of -- and the bottoming out, some signs of bottoming out within RM, less so within DM. I think probably, the only other thing I'd add is then, obviously what we do try to do is make sure we're managing costs very tightly against whatever revenues that we have. I think it's been said on a number of occasions, it's the storage part of our business is where most of the value comes from. Services is an important contributor, but less material in terms of overall value. So the challenge for us is as these trends sort of work their way out, we need to -- and have been continuing to sort of make sure our costs are mapped accordingly.
 Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Very helpful. And then just from a margin perspective, we had some impact this quarter from REIT compliance costs and acquisition-related costs. Just looking ahead, how do you expect these costs to evolve? And what kinds of sources of margin expansion can help mitigate these incremental costs?
Roderick Day: Well, certainly, the REIT costs that we now include in our adjusted OIBDA, are those that -- essentially, those costs are the need to allow us to sustain the REIT structure going forward. So, if you think -- we're effectively incurring them this year, we would expect to incur them again next year. So from a year-on-year dynamic, this year is kind of a negative because we didn't have them last year. Next year, it will be neutral from a year-on-year perspective. I think in terms of acquisitions, it will depend obviously on the -- what the future acquisition program is and how it plays out. The way that we work our acquisitions today is that in the first year, there's typically a significant amount of integration expense as we look to make sure we drive the synergies out of the businesses that we get. And then from year 2, the benefits really start to flow through. So, from the acquisitions that we've made so far, clearly, there will be a benefit year-on-year as we go '15 to '14. I think in terms of what does that mean fully in '15, it will depend on when we do any more acquisitions going forward, and the sort of the level of them. We're expecting that our acquisition program will be similar in scale, but clearly, it's always hard to predict exactly what we'll be able to close.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Let me just -- following up on that margin question, and I apologize if some of this -- I did hear was in the prepared remarks. But on the international margin decline, what -- I mean, that was down 290 basis points. I assume some of that was these M&A costs. But can you maybe give us that number in the magnitude just to kind of help us think about what's going on there?
Roderick Day: Well, I think what we do on the international side is we really try to manage it so over the course of the year, we're around the 25% mark. So year-to-date, I think we're at 24.5%. I think in the quarter itself, it was below that. Certainly, that number is the one that tends to get impacted more by phasing of acquisition -- the acquisition integration spend because that's where a significant amount of our acquisitions have been. So it can sort of jump around a bit depending on whether we're investing to get synergies or the synergies are coming out. But overall, I think we're quite happy where we're at, tracking to the sort of mid-20s margin, and that's pretty much where we are year-to-date.
William L. Meaney: Yes, the only thing I'd add to it. You -- just reiterating or emphasizing what Rod is saying is we wouldn't change -- we've said that -- we had that program to target the improvement to get up to 25% or mid-20% margins in the international portfolio, we wouldn't move off of that. You will get noise from time to time because of the timing of certain acquisitions and integration costs associated with that, but we feel pretty good about the portfolio as it is today that the maturing of some and adding of others that we think that mid-20s in terms of margin target is where we'll maintain.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. I guess, my second question is kind of a 2-part, I guess, around M&A. I mean, the first part, just mechanically, how much M&A revenue is assumed in the 2015 guidance? And I guess, the capital that you're planning in the guidance to spend, do you have revenue and OIBDA attached to that in the guidance? Or would that be incremental? That's the first part. And then I guess, the second part of the question would be, given the leverage and the capital needs that you have, is there anything that would prohibit you from doing larger acquisitions if they came to the market maybe through an equity issuance? And how do you think about your cost to capital here as ability to do that?
Roderick Day: Maybe just to answer the first point, if you look at what we've done, the year-on-year benefit from acquisitions will be $30 million. And in terms of future spend do you want to...
William L. Meaney: I think it's hard to say what we can and we can't do in terms of acquisitions. We don't see a need on the -- this year, we obviously didn't need to do a major equity raise. So I suppose these things are always possible, but this year, for sure, we didn't have to contemplate anything like that to do the acquisitions that we have.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Right. But if something was to be more material, where it wasn't the smaller acquisitions that are out here, is equity a potential tool that you could use?
Roderick Day: Yes, equity is always a potential tool, but I don't like to talk about hypotheticals when -- because it depends on what the markets are doing and everything else. So -- but I mean, equity and debt are always the tool that you have when you're investing in your business or doing acquisitions. But, as I said, this past year, we didn't have to contemplate that.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Got it. And just to be clear, that $30 million benefit from M&A in 2015, that's -- you said, Rod, that, that was from the acquisitions that have been completed year-to-date, that doesn't include any potential acquisitions?
Roderick Day: Yes, that's exactly right, Justin, that's where we're at. And then, clearly, if we are to do more, there will be more coming through. We'll obviously look to update the guidance at the end of next quarter on this because it can be a material impact on our numbers, but that's kind of where we're heading at the moment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: I wanted to start just a little bit on Slide 9, just going over some of the trends over there. On the bottom chart, in Records Management volume growth, since the beginning of the year, we've seen the out firm terminations go down. I was wondering how much of that is kind of a natural change that you're seeing? And how much of that had to do with the contracting -- proactive contracting changes that you guys made? And should we expect that to continue to improve through the course of next year?
William L. Meaney: Shlomo, it's Bill. It's a good question. I think that what I would say is that we're down to really where you would expect to be, roughly around the -- we're at 1.9%. So yes, the 2% to 1.9%, I think is probably the right level of that. And I wouldn't say it was even the contracting terms, I think it just came down to good customer service and good customer management. I think -- quite frankly, we had take our eye off the ball. We've introduced some software and tools, which I think we discussed at Investor Day, which has really helped us identify when we were kind of off the point in terms of customer service so that we could intervene before we had what I would call a significant customer service failure. So I think that has helped. So we've been able to play a lot better defense by keeping our customers happy and servicing them more proactively, and that's really helped a lot. So, believe it or not, it's just been focusing on the basics of the business rather than any magic from either contracting or anything else. But I think at some point, I think that clearly, the 2.7%, if you look back in Q4 of 2012, was way too high. And I think we're getting to the levels that I think a business with a good customer service apparatus would be targeting. So I think we're in the zone now.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: And I appreciate that. What about the organic side of the business over there -- we saw 6.8 going down to 6.1. Is that -- where is your sense of that kind of stabilizing? And is that the manifestation of kind of industry trends? How should we think of it? I know clearly, the goal is to offset the 2 that we're talking about right now, just trying to gauge if that's going to be kind of -- you've achieved the optimum. Or where you think you can get on the bottom? Where we are on that side of it?
William L. Meaney: I think -- look, I think part of it is driven by mix, quite frankly. In other words -- and not just in the North American versus international, but even the country mix within international, there are certain countries that we find that we're going into that are really at the early stages of outsourcing, and there are other ones that we're entering and they are more mature in their outsourcing, so they have lower growth rates. The other thing is -- and also being honest about it is that there's -- it's more art than science how we split between the new sales and the organic. Because in the new sales, it's both new logos and new business opportunities with existing customers. So it's a little bit -- so you have to kind of look at both numbers together, but I would say right now is -- clearly, in the mature markets is that we've always said they're kind of in the 6% to 7% range. Some of them are more trending towards the 6%. Some of them are still kind of in the upper 6% to 7%. And then the other thing is even in the emerging markets, we find quite significant variances between what the organic growth rate is in different countries. So some of the organic growth rates in some of the emerging markets, for instance, is north of 10%, and others is at 7%. So I think it's both a country mix issue. I think it's even within the developed markets, there's a mix across countries. And then the other aspect about it is there is an art rather than scientific split between new sales and the organic.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, good. And then just a couple of other ones. Rod, will changes to FX impact the $4.10 to $4.20 in dividends expected for 2015?
Roderick Day: I guess it would depend on the extent of any FX change. I think sitting where we are today, we would be pretty comparable with that range. But I suppose I'm just putting a caveat out there, if things were to take a real, significant turn for the worse in terms of a real material strengthening of the dollar, we just have to sort of reserve the right to have a look at that.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Sure. But just leaving the exchange rates where they are today and just carrying them forward, you're comfortable with that $4.10 to $4.20?
Roderick Day: Yes, that's fine. But as I -- Shlomo, we've seen quite a marked shift just in the last month. So, it may even come back to our advantage, but it is a bit volatile at the moment.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Sure, got it. And then finally, Bill, where do you guys stand in terms of going after the smaller business and the Cornerstone acquisition? I noticed it was kind of a strategic, a little bit more platform over there. We talked about progress in prior quarters. Can you just give us an update there?
William L. Meaney: Yes, thanks. That's a good question. Well, first of all, I think that we still remain focused on what I would call that middle market, because that tends to be, say both very fragmented and very unvended, right? So we think that's kind of a really interesting area, and there's a lot of growth in that segment. So I would say that it's early days in terms of us fully capturing the revenue synergies, if you will, or kind of the D&A synergies that we aim to get from the Cornerstone in the sense that, this year, we did the reorganization, the whole sales force. So the sales force is aligned to go after that highly fragmented and unvended middle market, but we've concentrated our training this year more on the verticals. And this -- in 2015, actually starting I think it's next quarter, so the last quarter of this year and early in 2015 is we're really focusing, rolling out both our training in performance management associated with that unvended middle market part of the segment where Cornerstone played quite well at.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: And is pricing higher or lower over there versus the larger...
William L. Meaney: It tends to be higher, and -- but also, the service cost is higher associated with these, because these are smaller -- obviously smaller customers. So we do see a correlation between size of customer and pricing, but also, our cost is different, servicing this.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. Are there any closing remarks?
Roderick Day: Actually, I just wanted to make a clarification. In my statement earlier, I think I said that we would -- our current liquidity is $1.2 million. We're actually down to our last $1 billion as opposed $1 million. So I should have said $1.2 billion. Just so, in case anyone was having a heart attack. So, thanks.
William L. Meaney: Thank you very much. Thanks for all your time, and we'll speak to you next quarter. Thanks.
Roderick Day: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Kimberly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q2 Earnings Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Marsden, you may begin your conference.
Melissa Marsden: Thank you, Kimberly, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for the company. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and progress toward our strategic initiatives, followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results and discuss elements of our new supplemental reporting package. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation available at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2014 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, Slide 2 of the supplemental reporting package, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those on our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations to these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, are included in these supplemental reporting package. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William L. Meaney: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. This was a good quarter for the company, highlighted by the receipt in late June of the favorable private letter ruling from the IRS and our conversion to a REIT. As we've said from the beginning of the process, we believe we fit well as a REIT due to our sizable real estate portfolio. We have a very attractive business model, through which we incur occupancy costs on a square foot basis and generate storage rental revenue on a cubic foot basis. This significant spread between our cost and our return on investment generates high net operating income per square foot and is core to how we create value for our stockholders. We also distinguished ourselves through low turnover costs per square foot. We have no TIs, or tenant improvements, required if a customer terminates and we bring in another customer's records. We also have a low customer churn of less than 2% per annum as well as maintaining high quality receivables giving our service to 950 of the Fortune 1,000. The REIT structure complements our strategy whilst enhancing payouts and it highlights our highly disciplined approach around asset allocation. As a REIT, we expect to continue to generate the cash flow necessary to support attractive stockholder return and to invest -- to sustain the durability of the business while continuing to identify opportunities for enhanced growth in line with our long-term strategic plan. We also see the potential to purchase a significant portion of our leased real estate over time, thereby reducing our cost of debt and enhancing residual values. The recent roadshow presentation available on our website addresses many of the common questions related to our conversion. So we're not going to spend a lot of time on that in prepared remarks today. Rather, I'll focus on what we're seeing in the business and the progress on our strategic plan and then Rod will cover financial and operating specifics whilst directing you to the relevant sections of our new supplemental reporting package. Turning now to financial highlights. Total revenue for the quarter was $787 million, up 4.4% on a constant dollar basis, with adjusted OIBDA of $242 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.41 per share, up roughly 5%. These results were in line with our presentation during our Investor Day in March and demonstrate the same growth rate on a like-for-like basis, both as a C-corp as well as now as a REIT. We maintained our high adjusted OIBDA margins for the total enterprise of roughly 31% during the quarter, with consistent performance in our North American segments and international margins in line with our targeted level in the mid-20s percent range. In addition, we achieved solid operating results and are making good progress on our strategic plan to sustain the durability of our high return business in developed markets, having added a net 1.3 million cubic feet of internal growth in the first half of the year in North America. Moreover, having reached 12% of our sales coming from emerging markets by the end of Q2, we are on track to our goal of having 16% of our sales from this high-growth segment by 2016. Finally, we continue to identify and test new and emerging business opportunities as well as further scaling of our data center opportunity. Total storage rental revenue, the key economic driver of our business, was up 5.7% in constant dollars, driven by strong growth of 14% in our International business and constant dollar growth of 3.3% in North American Records and Information Management, or RIM. Storage rental internal growth of 1.6% for the quarter reflected solid growth in Records Management volume of 1.7% in terms of internal growth and 7.6% if we include acquisitions year-on-year. We continue to see improvement in retention in North America, where a total records management storage volume outflows dropped to 6.6% from 6.8% in the first quarter and 7.1% in the fourth quarter 2013. We are pleased with this progress, as the reduction and terminations supported by our first quarter of net positive volume growth in North America Records Management since 2011. Importantly, we maintained strong North American Records Management margins of more than 38% during the quarter through ongoing productivity enhancements whilst continuing to invest in strengthening customer relationships and product development. In our internal -- International business, constant dollars storage rental growth was about 14% overall, with 32% constant dollar growth in emerging markets. These emerging markets, which, as I mentioned, represent just 12% of our total enterprise revenues today, have very favorable growth dynamics. Emerging market storage rental internal growth was 12% in the second quarter whilst volume expanded by 10% excluding acquisitions, or 33% in total, reflecting the successful integration of acquisitions completed in 2013. Acquisitions continue to be an integral part of our strategy overall, with a particular emphasis in these high-growth markets. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities in emerging markets, with more than 3x the coverage needed to achieve our goal of growing this part of our business to 16% of total revenue by the end of 2016. We evaluate acquisitions in terms of how they can both further our market leadership and sustain the durability of our business after first establishing that we can exceed our cost of capital and achieve our targeted returns. During the second quarter, we completed a few small customer acquisitions in the U.S., as well as tuck-in -- a tuck-in acquisition in Brazil and closed the previously announced transaction in Poland, bringing us to about $60 million of company acquisitions and another $10 million of customer acquisitions year-to-date. Within our emerging business opportunity area, we are pleased with the early interest in our data center operations. We have booked more than 70% of the inventory space we developed in our underground facility and are kicking off our next phase of development there. Additionally, we have signed our first few small deals in our data center near Boston, which we just completed last month. It is early days, but we have a good pipeline building up. Our targeted segment of the data center market has good growth dynamics and the potential to generate very attractive returns, and we will continue to employ a success-based approach to investment as we look to scale this business. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued solid constant dollar storage rental revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth in line with the 4% longer-term goals we've discussed in the past. We expect consistent trends with what we're seeing for durable storage rental revenue in developed markets and a moderation in the rate of activity-based service revenue declines. We are on track to make emerging markets, which achieve low-double digit internal storage growth rates, a more significant portion of our overall sales mix. And in our emerging business area, we continue to identify and test opportunities which are complementary to our core business and resonate with our customers. Overall, Q2 was a very solid quarter, anchored by our favorable REIT news and further progress on our strategic plan. We believe we are on track to deliver against our 2014 goals, as well as our longer term objectives. As a reminder, those are to: deliver shareholder total shareholder returns in the range of 8% to 9% in line with the S&P 500; provide predictable earnings and dividend growth with low volatility; and generate further upside over and above the 8% to 9% returns from our investments and additional emerging business opportunities. Currently, it is interesting to note that we are well on track with this overall goal given our current dividend yield of approximately 6%, combined with our growth in OIBDA of 5%, or what translates loosely into a total shareholder return, or TSR, of 11% plus any upside from emerging businesses. The REIT supports these goals as the yield component is now a bigger contributor to our targeted returns and supports our capital allocation approach. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod.
Roderick Day: Thanks, Bill. In keeping with our conversion to a REIT, we have begun to transition our financial disclosure to provide information that we believe will be useful to both current investors, as well as potential new investors. Going forward, rather than issuing a standalone press release and posting slides, supplemental debt statistics and GAAP reconciliations on the website, we will provide all these disclosures in 1 comprehensive supplemental reporting package. We anticipate enhancements to this package over time and would welcome your feedback. With that, let me direct your attention to the financial highlights on Page 7. We delivered solid results in Q2, which were supported by strong storage rental growth, good profit performance and the benefits from recent acquisitions in emerging and developed markets. Total reported revenues were $787 million for the quarter, up more than 4% compared with $754 million in 2013. Both gross margin and adjusted OIBDA were up approximately 4%, in line with our strategic planning goals. Year-to-date, adjusted OIBDA in 2014 includes $3.6 million of costs associated with the company's 2013 restructuring and $3.9 million of ongoing REIT compliance costs. Adjusted EPS of $0.41 increased by about 5% from $0.39 in the second quarter of 2013, which was restated to be on a comparable basis using our current structural tax rate of roughly 15%. For both the quarter and the year-to-date, we booked sizable discrete net tax benefits associated with the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and assets related to our conversion. Just a bit more color on this. Tax accounting for C-Corps requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future expected tax impact of temporary differences between our tax basis and our financial reporting basis. As a REIT, instead of that booked to tax difference being reflected at our U.S. federal tax rate of 35%, it is now being reflected at 0% for the portion of the business that is included in the REIT and the QRS, or qualified REIT subsidiary structure. This is effectively a onetime reset of our deferred tax liabilities and assets and resulted in a large noncash benefit. While we no longer -- while we'll no longer be taxed at the U.S. federal level on our QRS income, we will continue to pay local tax on our international operations, including in those countries that were converted to the REIT structure. And of course, we'll continue to pay taxes on our global service operations and certain state taxes. But the REIT structure allows us to effectively repatriate storage-related income from the REIT countries and distribute it to stockholders without double taxation. While our structural rate for year-to-date came out to 15%, we continue to believe that a rate in the 17% range over the long term is about right. For the full year in 2014, we expect the structural rate to be between 15% and 17%. We have normalized FFO to adjust for these one-off tax effects as well. Another highlight from this page is our summary of our investments in capital expenditures. As you can see, due to the nature of our storage rental business, maintenance CapEx per foot is very low. Maintenance CapEx of roughly $30 million year-to-date is running slightly behind the $90 million midpoint of our full year guidance, as we typically see in the majority of CapEx improvement projects undertaken in the latter portion of the year. Other CapEx is right in line with the $50 million midpoint of the full year guidance, and real estate investment, including racking, is on pace with our full year expectation of around $200 million. Turning to components of revenue growth on Page 8. On a constant dollar basis, revenue is up 4.4%, reflecting solid storage rental revenue gains of 5.7%, while service revenue growth of 2.7% was driven by recent acquisitions, as well as fees from new inbound volume and increases in imaging projects and shredding activity. On a constant dollar basis, first half total revenue growth was 4.6%, driven by storage rental revenue gains of 5.5%, and service revenue growth of 3.3%. Also on this page, you can see that we continue to demonstrate improvement in net volume growth in Records Management, with total year-on-year volume growth in the quarter of 7.6% including acquisitions, or 1.7% excluding acquisitions. As we've noted previously, despite secular trends in the use of paper, we continue to see very consistent trends in the amount of incoming volume from our existing customers. In addition, we had increased contribution from acquisitions year-over-year and further improvements in the level of terminations and withdrawals, particularly in North America, as Bill highlighted earlier. On Page 10, we present components of growth on a segment basis. As you'll recall, in the first quarter, we amended our reporting structure to align with the way we manage the business. We broke down our North American segment into North American Records and Information Management, or RIM, North American Data Management or DM, an emerging business, which are currently a component of the corporate and other segments. Q2 segment results were generally in line with our expectations and consistent with recent trends. North America Records and Information Management delivered positive storage rental internal growth and maintained strong adjusted OIBDA margins of about 38%. We also improved capital efficiency, with spending at 4.3% of revenues, excluding real estate. North American Data Management storage rental was flat. Service declines continued to reflect the trend towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues as the business becomes more archival. However, we maintained strong adjusted OIBDA margins of more than 60% in this segment despite the reduction in revenues. The International segment continues to generate strong growth, with 14% constant dollar storage rental and 11.6% constant dollar growth in services, driven by recurring imaging projects. International business continue to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis, in line with our mid-20s target, with adjusted OIBDA margins of 23.8%. This is slightly down on the previous quarter, as a result of phasing of acquisition integration spends. Finally, corporate and other revenue was up 9%, reflecting growth in data center service revenues. As Bill noted, we're building out our pipeline in the data center business, so these comparisons are on a very small basis. On Page 17, we provide reconciliations from net income to FFO and then show further adjustments for noncash items to arrive at AFFO. Our FFO and AFFO figures reflect the deferred tax benefit resulting from the flushing entry that I mentioned earlier. If you were to use the Q2 normalized FFO as the run rate for the second half, or $118 million times 2, and add it to the year-to-date FFO of about $225 million, you will arrive at about $460 million of FFO, consistent with our full year guidance. A similar approach to AFFO revealed about $600 million for the full year. As mentioned on our reapproval call, with our projected ordinary dividend of $400 million to $420 million, we have strong coverage for our dividend relative to AFFO. Turning to some of our new disclosures. On Page 18, we present storage net operating income to provide a closer look at NOI from our records management and data management storage operations. We have also added a summary of our global real estate portfolio on Page 19 to show owned versus leased buildings and the associated facilities counts in square footage by major region. And on Page 20, we provide square footage of racked space by product type: records management, primarily the bulks business, and data protection or tapes. NOI per racked square foot, on this page, highlights the attractive economics that we derive from our real estate, which Bill mentioned earlier. On Page 22, we provide utilization for our records management and data protection businesses. The top portion of the page shows the trailing 5-quarter trend in both cubic feet of records and data protection tapes stored, as well as year-over-year growth. The bar charts towards the bottom of the page show the total amounts of installed racking we have in these 2 businesses and the capacity we have for racking, assuming our buildings were all fully racked. The utilization numbers below are the cubic feet of records or number of DPUs stored, expressed as a percentage of the racking we have in place and as a percentage of what our maximum rack capacity could be. As you can see, our utilization rates are quite high. We believe that due to frictional vacancy, our maximum utilization is in the mid-90s percent. Bear in mind that in the new facility, we would generally target to achieve stabilized utilization in about 3 years. We have some upside here, as we enhance the utilization through acquisition integration and facility consolidation over time. On Page 23, we show service business detail. This presentation has been updated from what was provided in our recent roadshow presentation. Effective July 1 of this year, we established CRS service entities in each of our identified REIT countries, which included transferring the designation of some employees who perform services in our warehouses that were previously categorized as storage-related. The transfers of these of these employees in REIT countries resulted in a shift of about $7 million of labor expenses, previously categorized as storage rental labor to services labor. We expect similar minor transfers of storage rental labor costs in the future, as we establish CRS service entities in any future REITs countries. So the basis for year-over-year comparisons will generally not be the same. We have provided a look at our customer base on Page 24. This highlights our StrongBox retention of around 93%, as well as the diversification of our large global customer base. We also provide sales, marketing and account management and customer acquisition costs, which we think of as similar to typical REIT turnover costs. Shifting to the balance sheet. Pages 25 and 26 present our debt maturity schedule and related metrics. Solid cash flow generation enables us to maintain a sound balance sheet. At quarter end, liquidity was virtually unchanged from Q1 at about $536 million, with $170 million in cash and $390 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our total lease-adjusted leverage ratio of 5.1x, which is at the high end of our targeted range, has increased over the past 3 years, as planned to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to our REITs and recent acquisitions. We expect leverage to temporarily exceed our target range of 4x to 5x in the short term, due to costs associated with the REIT conversion. We do have extraordinary expenditures remaining in the first year of conversion, including: about a $130 million of cash associated with a special distribution, assuming the midpoint of our range and today's share price; another $85 million representing the bulk of the remaining tax recapture payments, due to the change in our depreciation schedule; and another $30 million of REIT conversion costs. If you were to look at 2014 on a normalized basis, absent these costs, and grow the components of free cash flow into 2015 at our expected growth rate and adjusted OIBDA, our excess cash available for investment, after paying our ordinary dividends, more than covers core real estate investments, including racking and leasehold improvements. Should we be more opportunistic about acquiring buildings outright or buildings associated with business acquisitions, we would look to borrow at our targeted leverage ratio or, perhaps, use equity to fund such investments. Given the returns we can generate from leveraging our scale and global platform, such financing would be a good use of capital. Lastly, on Page 28, we have provided components of value, which is a summary of the various parts of our business to facilitate valuation. A couple of things to note. We present storage NOI and service OIBDA, excluding rent expense, in order to present storage economics on a consistent basis, whether leased or owned. We also provide our total rent expense in the liabilities area. We are currently showing investment in buildings, racking and acquisition at book value, but it's our intent to -- ultimately, to provide a schedule of these investment categories with our expected returns. This schedule is followed by comprehensive definition of terms, which we believe will be helpful to investors to adjust to our new disclosure. In summary, Q2 was a good quarter, supported by sustained storage rental performance, continued high levels of profitability in our North American segments, and strong international and emerging market performance. And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
 Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Bill, internal growth and storage rentals this quarter increased about 1.6%, which is up from the prior quarter's growth of 1.4%, but still is below historical 2% growth levels. Can you discuss your outlook for internal storage growth and what potential catalysts that you can see that can drive further acceleration?
William L. Meaney: No, I think that, as we said last time, we weren't guiding for an immediate rebound to what we saw last year. But I think you have to look at the total picture in terms of the volume growth that we generated. Let's say, this is the first quarter since 2011 that we had a positive volume growth in North America. So there is a balance to get in terms -- because what we're looking for is total revenue, not just on the pricing front. I think, in terms of -- on the price, I think the -- it's an area in a low-inflation environment that we continue to work on and optimize further. But, I think, we're still where we were last quarter, which we are slightly improved from where we were 3 months ago. But we're saying it's more of a gradual improvement to expect rather than a rapid rebound to the 2% that you referenced.
 Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Right. And turning to services. Internal growth this quarter reflected some lower project fees in customer terms in North America. Do you think this is a secular trend, or do you expect a rebound in internal growth and services next quarter?
William L. Meaney: I think there is 2 bits, as you know, on the service front. There are things that are, what I would call, core services that related to our records management and data management business, and then there is the project side. And the -- I wouldn't say they're secular. You're right to call out that the change in trend on the service revenue side is driven by a drop-off in some project -- large projects that we had last year. But projects in their very nature are lumpy, and it's not -- the fact that some of those haven't been replaced at the same level in this quarter is not a trend, it's rather just the nature of that part of the business. In terms of the other part of the business that we've been calling out as having headwinds, which is related to our core services around data management and records management, there we do see a flattening out of the headwinds, if you will. But, I think, in terms of the thing that was driving the major change in this quarter was the lumpiness of some of the specific projects that we do to service some of our customers.
 Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: All right, makes sense. Rod, you've indicated you expect an effective tax rate of about 17% on a go-forward basis. Can you detail how taxes will play out in the remainder of the year and what you expect cash tax savings to be taking into account differences between book and cash taxes?
Roderick Day: Yes. So in terms of the rate that we expect, we had 15% in Q2, as I said earlier. The range that we expect for the remainder of the year will be between 15% and 17%. The reason for the slight level of uncertainty is that we obviously still pay tax on our overseas operations within those countries and also within -- on the service activity that we have within North America. So depending on the mix of the business, that will drive some small variation in the amounts of tax that we have to pay. So therefore, we do see a range, if you like, between 15% and 17%. In terms of the cash tax saving, I'd say the sort of simple way to think about that would be, if you say historically we used to pay 39% and we're now down in the sort of 15% to 17%, that would be sort of the ratio to take as the kind of key driver of change. We will, as I was saying though earlier, have to pay additional tax associated with the slowdown in the depreciation of our racking, and that will come through this year. It's not part of our normalized tax rate, but it will impact our numbers this year.
 Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Got it. And you're still expecting cash tax savings of about $120 million per year?
Roderick Day: Correct, yes.
 Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, you've indicated you're accelerating your acquisition plans and plans to own more strategic real estate over time. Can you detail how you plan to finance these growth plans and if there will be a need for capital raises near term?
Roderick Day: We are still working through the details of that, because the key thing for us is, obviously, to finance these in the most effective way. The likelihood is that we will finance some through debt and some through some level of equity, but we will structure this in such a way that we can generate the maximum level of returns for our investors. And we'll provide more details of that, as we work our way through that later this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just following-up on one of George's questions, special project activity in the service area. There has been a belief in the past that, that can be an indicator that business is picking up or slowing down. And you mentioned it's been lumpy. Do you guys take any readthrough from what you're seeing right now, or do you just stick more with the view of the lumpiness and it's not really a foreshadowing of things to come?
William L. Meaney: No, I don't think it's a very good leading indicator for, Scott, on the activity levels. So the nature of these things, for instance -- I think one of our larger projects last year was for a mortgage company, because they had certain things that they were actually selling and repackaging to someone else and we had to go in and help them, which both scan and organize a number of these documents. So it's that kind of lumpiness of activity. It's usually related to either a on-boarding of a major customer that has some specific needs or a major customer doing some kind of transaction that requires special services. So it tends to not have a very good correlation with, I think, any leading indicator. So it really is a one-off type project. Now given the -- it's even probably more lumpy than you see, when you look at our business from an analytical standpoint, but given the scale of our business, some of those lumps smooth out, but it really is of that kind of nature.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Great. And then with regard, primarily in core storage and we'll group shredding in as well, could you discuss the pricing environment and the competitive environment, and what you're seeing out there?
William L. Meaney: I think that the -- I think it's fairly stable. I think that, if anything -- if you look at -- I think it was on Page 8. If you look at the trends in what's happening, I think that we don't see, I think, additional pressure on that. I think what we see now is, what we euphemistically call the power of the mountain, is we've got a lot more focused in honing our commercial skills. And as a result we are doing better both on defense and offense. So if you look at the trends from a year ago until today, you'll see that we've done better both in terms of sales, so out there winning by about 300 basis points over the whole period that we've got graft, and we've improve our defense by about 80 basis points. So I think that the -- I wouldn't -- and if you look at that in an environment where we're still pushing revenue -- positive revenue growth, are we making some trade-offs? Maybe, but a lot of it is also the segments that happen to be addressing, both in terms of the countries we're going after and the customers that we're going after. So I think, net-net, I don't see a major change in the competitive market other than we're using the power of the mountain or the scale that we have for the benefit of our customers, I think, much more fuller or much more comprehensively. I think the only thing that's a challenge in the low-inflationary environments that we have is price is always a challenge. Because most of the countries that we operate in, at least ones that we have any significant size, are in low inflationary environments and putting price increases through, and those types of environments is always difficult.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And just you cited that chart on Page 8. I'm curious, over the coming year or 18 months, where do you think -- excluding acquisitions from the discussion, which of the buckets there do you think will show the most change? I can tell ideally which ones you'd like to move the most, but which do you think will have the most significant moves?
William L. Meaney: Well, let's look at the chart. If we look at Q2 '14, just so we're just looking at the same numbers. So let's look at the charts by color chain [ph]. So if you look you look of the dark blue block just above the line and the right red black just below the line, I think those things are going to tend to run in similar trends. Although the light red, to me, also tends to have some lumpiness, some of that is to do with legal holds coming on or off, so you can have some movement around that 4.7. But I think, generally, that's what we would call the organic growth of the business. So I think, as I've pointed out previously, that independent of everything else, even though paper itself is in decline, document growth -- new document growth from existing customers tends to be in the 6% to 7% range, which is the dark blue block, and I expect that to stay in that range. That gets netted out, because customers are going through different life cycles with their inventory and that's been bouncing around the 4.5% to, say, 4.7% range. And I would expect those -- so I expect those 2 to be relatively stable going forward. I think the -- lets leave the acquisitions out, because that is -- we do have an acquisition strategy, biased more towards the emerging markets. But I think what you're really referring to is: what's the organic growth health of the business in terms of things that are -- that's more incremental? So I think then it really comes down to you asking, are we going to do better or with the trend in terms of new sales, which is the lighter blue or the kind of medium blue bar, 2.2%; and our defense, which is the out perm, so where we are actually are losing business, which is dark red, of minus 2%. To say that we're going to continue on a certain trend line, I'm not going to guide for that. The only thing I would say is that, I think, the improvement that we've highlighted, I think we should be able to hang on to in that order of magnitude of where we're taking is -- we're quite encouraged by a couple of things that we've done with our commercial operation, both in terms of the way that we develop products now and take advantage of our global scale, not just local scale, in terms of getting insights in terms of what customers find helpful in terms of our product and solution delivery. And then the other part of it is, is that some of the reorganization of our sales force that we've talked about a few quarters now, both in terms of the verticalization, which again, gives us better insights in terms of solutions that our customers are looking for. And that seems to be resonating where you see in both the better -- in trend both in new sales, as well as defense. And then the last aspect is, is that we are boosting our presence in the middle market. Our presence in the enterprise part of the segment has been strong for many, many years, but we're now also trying to have a similar representation in the middle market. So again, I think there is lots of things that underpin that we should be able to maintain those kinds of trends, but I'm not guiding for major increase in either of those.
Roderick Day: Bill, it's interesting points you make there. One sort of addition I just want to add is that we have service revenue associated with our perms and terms. And as they've decreased in the quarter, that actually had impact to our service revenue in the quarter. And it's a negative as it were on service, but it's a positive for the longer term of the business.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And, Rod, just one other thing. And I like the new presentation, by the way. On Page 24, where you show North America revenue by vertical, that pie chart, what is that? Is that the end of 2013? Is that as of June 30? And could you give us a feel for, maybe over the past few years and maybe looking forward to some activity you're seeing in the verticals, how might that pie chart change?
Roderick Day: Yes. So the numbers refer to sort of year-to-date '14, so it's kind of the latest view. I think what you'll see is that, as we sort of develop out our vertical strategy and really look to drive specific areas, we would expect some shift in this chart, although it's likely to be slow, just kind of given the annuity basis of our business. So the kind of areas where we do see potential, for example, would be federal, which is one area where there's plenty of unvended [ph] activity for us to go after, the whole area, the life sciences, energy and business services, very interesting new areas for us to be getting after. Legal and financial insurance, historically, we've been very strong in those segments. We'd expect to continue to bolster our presence. But in terms of potential relative to some of the other segments, it's probably less. So I would suggest. But would you agree with that, Bill?
William L. Meaney: Yes, I think that's a good summary. The only thing I also would add is in the other category, a lot of that is the middle market. And we have roughly 20% share of wallet in the middle market where we have, say, 60% share of wallet in the large enterprise market. So I'm not saying that we're going to get to the same share of wallet. But we do feel, like the federal market, that we're underrepresented in others. So how those things move out? But I would say that -- I agree with Ron saying as we're well represented in kind of the Big 3, so to speak, legal, financial and insurance, not that we wouldn't want more business there. We are constantly pushing. But we do have some areas like federal, and, I would say, the middle market, and other where we're underrepresented and we think there's real opportunity.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: One more, if I can sneak in, then I'll turnover. Just the one topic you didn't hit in that category was healthcare. I'm curious if you're seeing anything changed on that front?
William L. Meaney: It's a good question. We do normally talk about healthcare, so I'm glad you brought that up, Scott. We have -- we continue to be pleased with what we are seeing the swap-out, or the change. Because, obviously, the electronic medical records has affected our service revenue in healthcare probably more than any other vertical, as more and more of the healthcare records have gone online. That being said, we've been able to increase our storage revenue in healthcare by taking in more records. So we have year-on-year storage growth of almost a little less than 1%, which goes to that trend. So they're not destroying the records. In fact, we're getting more records as they're cleaning out the hospitals as well. In storage, as you recall, has about 2x the margin that service. So healthcare continues to be a major focus for us. We are also finding through these conversations, which goes back to Rod's comment about the verticalization, is we're gaining further insights on how we can service them even beyond the traditional, what I would call, medical record area. So it is an area where, I think, innovation is actually helping us, especially shifting us to higher-margin work.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: You talked about the activity service revenue declines narrowing. I remember this activity-based moving boxes around, moving tapes around being a drag for many years. I think it might have started in 2009. My question is: why do you feel now is a time where these activity service revenues are starting to even-out, and do we think that's kind of sustainable?
William L. Meaney: I think that the -- well, there is kind of a couple of things. One is that we're still seeing -- if we look at the 2 businesses, Andrew, I think it's worthwhile to look at records management versus data management, because data management, we still are seeing probably stronger headwinds in terms of getting to a, what I'll call, a stable floor than we are in records management. And the reason for that simply is that we're still finishing up the transition from tape being for backup and recovery to tape being an archival product. Right? So our storage volume, it continues to grow in the DM business, but how tape is being used is different. So as a result, we're doing this transition to a different service model, which happens to have a lower activity associated with it. And the thing I should highlight is, we are able to maintain our margins pretty closely during these drops in activity. So it's important to understand that it's an activity-driven. Whereas on the records management side, the data that we're looking at, we are further down that cycle, if I will, that transition to a more archival nature. So things like I was highlighting in healthcare, healthcare traditionally was a high-service business because it had a lot of, what we call, active file with medical records going backwards and forwards between the hospitals and our facilities. That obviously is gone away, or going away, fairly quickly in most locations. So I think in records management, that trend to archival nature of our services is further ahead, and we see that decline flattening out. So that's what we're really -- where we're looking at. At some point, it does get to the transition from active to archive you get through 80%, 90% of the transition, and I think that's where we're at with the records management. And we are -- I think we're well down that journey with data management, but we're not as far down the journey as we are with records management.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And do you think we'll ever get to a point where the service revenue, activity-based service revenues, could be flat?
William L. Meaney: I think, relatively, it's -- I think that it's probably going to kind of go up and down a little bit. I think the -- and it depends on what we replace some of that service revenues. So some of it is where we're replacing -- we're cannibalize our own backwards and forwards transportation, if you will, by providing them scanning and online options to retrieve data as well. So the part of it is, is we're also providing different ways for the customer to get the information back that's more efficient.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifle.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the real estate side of things. In terms of potential lease buyout, does your portfolio have any particular amount to favorable purchase options versus market value? Is there anything in there that's particularly attractive if you go through the portfolio, like a certain percentage of them?
Roderick Day: Yes. I mean, actually on Slide 27 of the supplement, so it gives you a sort of the profile of how our leases look to expire. And what this shows -- if you look at the top chart, it shows when the leases come up, the sort of first expiration, as it were, and then the bottom is what would happen if we were to extend our leases into the longer term. And so the reason why there is such a difference is that when we've taken out lease agreements, we have typically looked for very long-term leases. So we've always kind of had that option in there for us to be able to extent. So the first point, I guess, in terms of our ability to buy, is we are long-term tenants. People see us as long-terms tenants. And we try to sort of structure that within our lease arrangements. And so then the second thing we try to do, not with all leases, but with certainly a significant number, is indeed to incorporate elements as sort of buyout clauses within there, which should work to our advantage. So we have a purchase option immediate -- so a good approach is an option of around sort of 6 million square feet, and that should be at good terms for us. And we would look to move forward on -- so any elements of that. We will always do this in a way that creates value for shareholders, but that's kind of where we stand today.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: So is there an arbitrage opportunity in your portfolio, your lease versus buy, in terms of market value? That's just what I'm trying to get it
Roderick Day: Yes. No, for sure. So if you think of it, typically we might borrow around 6% -- the lease rate, if you like, would be around 8%. So you've got a 200-basis-point spread as a sort of general rule.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Basically, let me just restate what I'm trying to get at it, is there -- I'm saying, in terms of the purchase options, will you be buying real estate at below-market prices when you exercise those options? That's an actual, but more what I'm getting it.
William L. Meaney: I think the way to think about it is just reemphasizing what Rod is saying. Because we have fair market clauses in most of our leases, virtually almost all of our leases when we renew, that allows -- so the way you have to think about it is it's the cost of financing is how you create value, it's not the arbitrage in terms of being able to get something at a lower price. So I think the better way to model it or to think about it is that 200-basis-point spread, which is around the financing cost of 8% to lease, 6% to own, right? Because I wouldn't try to build in us being able to buy at a better price. I think where the arbitrage comes in, potentially, is on the residual values. Because what we're capturing, especially in the emerging markets which we are -- in my previous life, I played this out a number of times where we used to buy real estate purposely because we could capture, in 15 or 20 years, the urban growth to capture additional residual value. So that's a longer-term capture. And I think you have to also do it as a backdrop. When we say leases is that a number of our leases -- as I say, these typically are very long leases. So it -- in fact, if you look in places like Asia, you typically can only buy leaseholds, but you are able to get, effectively, the full economical ownership. In fact, in some markets, you can even get this part of the residual value because of your ability to trade leases. That's not in very country, but in some countries you can do that. So that's what we're really talking about is how do we actually take some these long-term leases where we have a lot of the economics of owning, and how do we further capture it? And I think the best way to think of it is the 200 basis points of potential spread between cost of ownership.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. So if I just take that further, so to the extent that you will issue equity in order to affect either lease buyouts or property's M&A, the immediate impact on a lease buyout would be the 200-basis-point spread and that should be accretive to investors on a cash flow basis? Is that the way to think of it?
William L. Meaney: I think -- I'll actually let Rod speak, but I think what Rod's saying, it will be a blend, most likely. I mean, that's the one thing that we're working out is the blend between equity and debt to do that. So it will be on a blended basis.
Roderick Day: So that's right, Bill. But certainly, we aim for the -- I think to the point, we are aiming for the investments to be accretive. Correct.
William L. Meaney: Yes.
Roderick Day: Yes.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: I mean, the other part of that in terms of, I think people are kind of getting to this, is in terms of potential equity issuances, is that how fast should you deploy or raise additional equity? How fast would you be able to deploy that in terms of being able to increase your FFO per share and AFFO per share? In other words, do you think there'll be a lag time of 6 months, or you'd be doing it kind of at the money as you need that type of stuff and so you'd make it immediately accretive?
Roderick Day: I think it would depend on the speed with which we could effectively acquire the leases, if I'm answering the question. So it will be -- it will depend on that phasing. So we wouldn't -- obviously, we wouldn't be able to buy all our leases on sort of day 1, but we would have -- we would expect to have a program to do so over time.
William L. Meaney: And I think -- look none of these things -- it'd be wonderful if we could do something today, and it's absolutely accretive the next day. I mean, these things -- we look at allocating capital on net present value basis and an earning per shares basis over stabilized returns, and we look at how long it takes you to get there versus how much you have to take in early. I think that the ability for most companies to be able to time these things exactly is never there. But I think it's fair to say, emphasizing what Rod's point is, is that if we go out and raise equity, for instance, it will be with a clear visibility and understanding of how that becomes accretive for the shareholders. But to say that you can do these things matching on a one-to-one basis instantaneously, I think we're not saying it can't be done, but I would say right now that it's hard to see how to do that. That being said, whatever we do, we'd be -- we would have the transparency around it with our shareholders and investors that how that is accretive in terms of their interest in the company.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. That's fair. And then just kind of a housekeeping question on Slide 28, in the annualized NOI. Could you just, maybe Rod, walk us through a little bit what you mean exactly for a stabilized portfolio versus the NOI that you would be reporting on a quarterly basis?
Roderick Day: Yes. So the way to think about the stabilized portfolio is, is a kind of like-for-like. So where we -- so we're kind of excluding acquisitions and buildings that would have come out of that portfolio. It's just kind of like core, if you like, within that.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: So it's going to exclude racking that's not fully utilized? I'm trying to just...
Roderick Day: No, it's the buildings as opposed to the racking. If we sell a building or acquire a building in the period, we wouldn't include that.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Dan Dolev with Jefferies.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Just a really quick data point. Two questions on Slide 8. Sorry if I missed that. Are those LTMs or are those quarterly figures?
William L. Meaney: Those are LTM.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: And I don't know if you've mentioned it already, but would you mind giving the data point on how this would look like on a North America record management, like you did in the last few quarters? Those same metrics, but on a North America basis?
William L. Meaney: Yes, I highlighted that in my remarks. If you go back -- I think you'll see that I went through. For instance, in North America, we added 1.3 million cubic feet of internal growth in the first half of this year.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. So but you didn't specify those specific -- the things that make up the buyer [ph], you did not specify that specific what's organic versus disruption, et cetera, for North America, right? Like the equivalent of Slide 8 for North America?
William L. Meaney: Yes, what I can give you is, for instance, is that below the bar, for North America, was minus 6.6%.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then the...
William L. Meaney: Which is a minus 6.7% in this one. And we can give you the numbers on above the bar. But what the North American -- so the North American below the bar is a little bit better than what it is on a consolidated basis. And then in terms of the net volume growth, before acquisitions, in North America, as I said, we added 1.3 million cubic feet.
Roderick Day: Which is 0.3%. So you kind of got a minus 6.7%, you got a plus 7% on...
Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Right, it improved. On an LTM basis, it improved versus Q4 and Q3 of last year. It's an improvement?
William L. Meaney: Actually, yes.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A session. Presenters, I would now like to turn the conference back over to you for closing remarks.
William L. Meaney: Thank you, operator. To wrap up, we had a strong quarter that demonstrates the durability of Iron Mountain, as well as our renewed commercial focus in delivering, what we call, "the power of the mountain" to our customers through harnessing our scale in product development and solution delivery. We demonstrated progress with our strategic plan in several areas. We are getting more out of developed markets, with solid improvement in volume and improved trend in internal growth. We are building our business in emerging markets and continuing to drive strong organic growth there. And our conversion to a REIT is driving improved returns, enhanced disclosure, and we believe over time an expanded shareholder base. We feel very strongly as a real estate company, the REIT structure enhances the value to our shareholders. And we're committed to driving attractive returns through continued expected growth in OIBDA and, ultimately, FFO and AFFO of about 4%, and believe the durability and stable growth in our business will support growth in our dividend, in line with cash flow growth over the long term. Thank you very much for joining us today.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-05-01 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Melissa Marsden William L. Meaney - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Roderick Day - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President
Analysts: George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Josh James - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Operator: Good morning. My name is Melissa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q1 2014 Earnings Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Melissa Marsden. You may begin your conference.
Melissa Marsden: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights of the quarter and strategic initiatives, followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. As is our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation available on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, can be found at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release. Before I turn the call over to Bill Meaney, I would like to add that, on February 28, we stated that we were in discussions with the IRS on a number of our PLR requests and we did not intend to provide additional interim updates with respect to any of the specific PLR requests, or generally, our progression through the IRS's PLR process. Accordingly, we will not be discussing the status of our PLR request on today's call. With that, Bill, would you please begin?
William L. Meaney: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. I would like to thank those of you who attended our investor conference last month. We very much appreciate the opportunity to present our strategy for future growth and to demonstrate the durability in low volatility, which have become a hallmark of Iron Mountain. Before I discuss our results for the quarter, I want to knowledge that many, if not all, of you who are looking for an update with respect to our conversion to a REIT. As Melissa just said in our forward-looking statements, we will not be discussing the status of our PLR request on today's call. Turning now to the performance of our business. Total revenue for the quarter was $770 million, up 4.7% on a constant dollar basis with adjusted OIBDA of $229 million and adjusted EPS of $0.26 per share, all of which were in line with our expectations. We maintained our high enterprise adjusted OIBDA margins of roughly 30% during the quarter with consistent performance in our North American segments and international margins coming in slightly ahead of our targeted level of about 25%. In addition, we achieved solid operating results as we advanced our strategic plan to sustain the durability of our high-return business in developed markets, expand into high-growth emerging markets and invest in emerging business opportunities, the most advanced of which is our data center business. Storage rental revenue, the key economic driver of our business, was up 5.3% in constant dollars, reflecting strong growth of nearly 13% in our international business and constant dollar growth of roughly 3% in both North American Records and Information Management or RIM and North America Data Management or DM. This breakout for North America is consistent with the way we manage our business and is reflected in our new segment disclosure, which I discussed during our Investor Day. Rod will have more detail on our segmented results shortly. Total storage rental internal growth was 1.4% for the first quarter. North America RIM internal growth was impacted by a mix shift to slightly lower average pricing on some contract renewals, which were biased towards a mix of enterprise customers. These contract renewals have led to better retention rates and we have seen North America RIM volume up approximately 600,000 cubic feet from the end of Q4 on an internal basis. As we noted at our recent event, there are several elements to driving storage growth in our developed markets. It is a mix of organic volume growth from existing customers; sales from new customers, including those that were previously un-vended; and some fold-in M&A at the right price with solid returns. And on top of that, you have price. We continue to analyze optimum pricing across our customer base and that sometimes means taking some deliberate price dilution to win long-term volume and/or sustain the durability of our customer relationships. All this being said, we continue to be able to invest in our customer relationships and product development through ongoing productivity enhancements. We maintained our North American RIM margins with a 37.5% margin versus 37% last year through continuous improvement initiatives, which we undertake to yield both real productivity gains and to modify our cost base as the business becomes more archival for certain segments. Our financial and operating results were further enhanced by the successful integration of acquisitions completed in 2013. Acquisitions continue to be an integral part of our strategy. They enable us to achieve leadership positions in emerging markets and leverage our unparalleled platform of people, properties and services in developed markets. As always, our acquisition strategy is guided by our capital allocation approach through which we must exceed our cost of capital and achieve targeted returns in excess of our hurdle rates. Moreover, we always undertake acquisitions with a view how an investment can further both our market leadership, as well as the continued durability of our business. We've been actively executing against our deal pipeline since the beginning of the year, completing 5 international transactions representing $60 million of total consideration and another $5 million of tuck-in acquisitions in the U.S. In developed markets, our leading platform allows us to quickly and accretively integrate acquisitions and achieve targeted returns. These tuck-in acquisitions have very attractive fold-in economics with ROIC of 10% plus or roughly mid-teens equity returns. Internationally, we closed 3 deals in Turkey and Poland. Both are emerging market transactions with attractive growth characteristics where we have achieved or are developing market leadership positions. Constant dollar storage rental growth from emerging markets was 32% in the first quarter with an internal storage rental growth of 13%. As we recently highlighted, we have a strong pipeline of additional opportunities in emerging markets, representing more than 3x the level needed to achieve our goal of generating an incremental $100 million to $120 million in revenue from emerging market acquisitions by the end of 2016. Combined with 10% plus compounded annual growth in revenue from our existing base, we believe we can grow this portion of our business to 16% of total revenues by the end of 2016 from 11.6% of total constant dollar revenues today and from a previous base of 10% less than a year ago. With regard to emerging businesses. We are on track with bringing our first data center near Boston online by the end of the second quarter. We invested an additional $6 million in the first quarter to complete the first phase of the construction and we are pleased with the interest we are seeing. Since applying a focus on the business a year ago, we have seen all of the existing customers in our underground data center in Pennsylvania increase their custom with us by 10% to 15%, in line with industry averages. We completed our first foray into the colo market in the underground last December, and we have already contracted for 30% of the space with a pipeline equal to approximately 10x the remaining space available. Additionally, we are seeing more deals and larger deals in our pipeline. For the first phase of our 3-phase, 6-megawatt campus near Boston, we have strong customer interest with a pipeline of about 3x our initial capacity there. We are still in the early stages of developing this business, but we are pleased with what we're seeing in terms of interest and expect to achieve attractive returns on investment. We continue to monitor our progress and invest capital in a success-based manner. As we look forward to the remainder of 2014, we anticipate continued solid constant dollar revenue, storage rental revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth in line with the long-term goals we've discussed in the past. We expect consistent trends for durable storage rental revenue in developed markets and a moderation in the rate of service revenue declines. In our emerging markets, we are maintaining and modestly improving our profitability even as we add to our emerging market base. We are on track to make this segment, which achieves low double-digit internal storage growth rates, a more significant portion of our overall sales mix. Moreover, in our emerging business area, we continue to identify and test opportunities, which are near adjacencies to our core business and resonate with our customers. Overall, it was a solid quarter anchored by further progress on our strategic plan. We believe we are on track to deliver against our 2014 goals, as well as our longer-term objectives. As a reminder, those are to: first, deliver total shareholder returns in the range of 8% to 9% in line with the S&P 500, provide predictable earnings and dividend growth with low volatility and nurture our ability to generate potential upside from additional emerging business opportunities. On a final note, whilst we are not providing any PLR updates, as we have said and reiterated at our Investor Day, we believe we fit well as a REIT due to our sizable real estate portfolio and attractive characteristics such as a high net operating income per square foot, low turnover costs and high customer quality and retention. The REIT structure also complements our strategy whilst enhancing payouts to our stockholders and highlights our highly disciplined approach around asset allocation. As a REIT, we would continue to generate the cash flow necessary to sustain the durability of the business and support attractive stockholder returns in line with our long-term strategic plan. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rod.
Roderick Day: Thanks, Bill. Let's now turn to Slide 3, which highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered solid results in Q1, which were supported by strong constant dollar storage rental growth, good profit performance and the benefits from recent acquisitions in emerging and developed markets. As Bill stated, storage rental growth grew 5.3% on a constant dollar basis in the quarter. This was supported by 3.0% and 2.8% growth in the North American Records and Information Management and Data Management segments, respectively, as well as 12.7% growth in the International segment. Adjusted OIBDA was in line with expectations in Q1. Included in our first quarter adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS is $2.4 million of restructuring charges, as well as $3.5 million in charges for the insurance deductible associated with the recent fire in one of our facilities in Argentina. We expect to incur an additional $3.3 million in the remainder of 2014 in connection with the organizational realignment. Our Q1 '14 CapEx of $47 million, excluding real estate and REIT costs, was in line with our expectations. Free cash flow of negative $20 million was primarily driven by higher cash interest expense, the payment for restructuring charges accrued at the year end, as well as the timing of payables. Looking at the free cash flow on a rolling 12-month basis, this was $320 million, in line with our projections. At this time, we are not making any changes to our guidance. Although 2014 full year results will be boosted by recent acquisitions, this increase to revenue will be partially offset by the FX losses based on current rates. In addition, there is some volatility relating to costs in Argentina, but at this time, our best view is these fall within the range of our guidance. Let's move on to Slide 4 to review our financial results in more detail. As we discussed previously, during this quarter, we amended our reporting structure to align the way we manage the business. We changed the composition of our North American segment to the following 3 operating segments: first, North American Records and Information Management or RIM; second, the North American Data Management or DM; and finally, the emerging businesses. Emerging businesses are currently a component of the corporate and other segment. As we break down the numbers, Q1 operating results were generally in line with our expectations and consistent with recent trends. Enterprise revenues grew 4.7% on a constant dollar basis as our International segment continued to produce strong results. Indeed, International posted 12.8% constant dollar total revenue growth helped by benefits from our recent acquisitions in emerging and developed markets. North American RIM posted 2.7% constant dollar total revenue growth. North American DM posted a 1 .5% decline in constant dollar total revenue. As we mentioned at our recent Investor Day, this business is becoming more archival in nature, which has created headwinds in the service revenue, although, to be clear, we continue to see consistent growth in DM storage revenue. Our corporate and other segment reflects revenue from our data center business. FX rate changes reduced total growth by approximately 160 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted OIBDA was $229 million, up 0.5% including the previously mentioned $2.4 million restructuring and the $3.5 million insurance deductible charges. A key driver of profit performance was the continued improvement in our International segments, as well as margin improvement in our North American RIM segments. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.26 per share compared to $0.27 in Q1 2013. GAAP earnings per share were $0.22, including $10 million of REIT costs, $5 million of other expense and $8 million of gains primarily from the disposal of property assets in the United Kingdom as we continue to consolidate our operations. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 39.4%. Let's now take a closer look at the components of revenue growth on Slide 5. Overall, total revenue internal growth was 0.5%. When we add the benefit from acquisitions of 4.2% and the offsetting 1.6% impact from negative foreign currency movements, total revenue reported growth was 3.1% for the quarter. Storage rental growth of 1.4% reflects the pricing mix that Bill described. However, we maintain solid margins in the business due to our speed and agility initiatives. Looking at the storage service split. Total storage rental growth of 5.3% on a constant dollar basis drove overall revenue performance. North American RIM reported 3.0% constant dollar storage rental growth, reflecting flat records management volume, pricing of 0.8% and the benefits from recent acquisitions. Records and Information Management pricing gains were below historical quarters, which reflects taking some appropriate pricing management to win and/or sustain the durability of customer relationships. North American DM reported 2.8% constant dollar storage rental growth driven by organic revenue, which was 2.3% for the quarter. International storage rental growth was 12.7% constant dollar for the quarter, reflecting 32% storage rental revenue growth in emerging markets, supported by strong organic growth and the benefits from acquisition. Internal storage rental growth remained strong with a 5.2% gain in the quarter. Total service revenues were up 3.8% on a constant dollar basis, supported by recent acquisitions, as well as increases in imaging projects and shredding activity, offset somewhat by a decrease in paper pricing when compared with the period 1 year ago. In North American RIM, paper-related revenue increased due to volume increases, but this was partially offset by average paper price declines approximately 5% year-on-year. On a more general level, as noted in recent quarters, we have seen a moderation in the rate of decline in our North American RIM service business. DM Service revenues are experiencing headwinds associated with the trend towards reduced activity levels and related transport revenues. International service growth was boosted by acquisitions and special projects. Let's now move to Slide 6 to discuss our volume growth. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, our proprietary customer insights platform is giving us a better view on customer thinking and that's resulting in lower levels of termination. Also as noted, despite secular trends in the use of paper, we continue to see roughly the same amount of incoming volume from existing customers. In addition, we are seeing an uptick in new sales, and of course, volumes are bolstered by acquisition activity. The resulting worldwide net volume growth of 6.7% in Q1 '14 is compared to the previous year. Let's now move to Slide 7 to discuss our segments in more detail. Consistent with our strategy, we're sustaining high returns in our North American segments as we continue to build out our International segment as a significant driver of profit. North America Records and Information Management delivered solid profits and reported revenues of $446 million increasing 2.7% on a constant dollar basis. This increase was driven by acquisitions. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved by 50 basis points year-over-year due to reduced overhead costs as a result of our restructuring efforts. We're also sustaining capital efficiency with spending at 3.8% of revenues excluding real estate. North American Data Management delivered revenues of $97 million for Q1, which declined by 1.5% on a constant dollar basis, primarily due to the decline in service revenues. This service decline was the result of a trend towards reduced activity and related transportation revenues as the business becomes more archival. Adjusted OIBDA margins declined by 400 basis points year-over-year due to the service revenue headwinds and cost reductions not yet being in proportion to the decline in revenue. Our International segment continues to post strong revenues and contribution progress. Adjusted OIBDA increased 23.8% on a constant dollar basis, benefiting from good global growth and cost improvement initiatives in developed markets. The International business continued to deliver profitability on a portfolio basis, in line with our mid-20s target with adjusted OIBDA margins of 26.2% for the first quarter. Finally, corporate and other revenue was down due to a change in contract terms with an early-stage customer as we continue to build out our pipeline in the data center business. Adjusted OIBDA was down compared to prior year levels, driven by the insurance deductible, restructuring costs, compensation and consulting fees relating to various strategic initiatives. Let's now talk about our acquisitions for 2014 on Slide 8. Acquisitions are an important element of our stated business strategy to drive continued profitable growth in our developed markets and to further penetrate attractive emerging markets. Through the end of April, we have completed 5 core transactions, investing approximately $60 million. These include 3 deals in Turkey and Poland, which enhanced our leadership position in these emerging markets, and the acquisition of a leading provider of off-site data storage and data protection services in Australia. In addition, we increased our ownership of a joint venture in Denmark. Post-acquisition, we generally realize the benefits of operating efficiencies within the first year or so. However, acquisition integration costs impacts our adjusted OIBDA for the first year. Benefits derived from rationalizing the real estate portfolio in an acquisition may take up to several years depending on the size of the business, lease expiration dates and the volume that needs to be moved. All of this is factored into our valuation models as we make our investment decisions. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust and we will continue to evaluate these opportunities through disciplined capital allocation and a return on capital lens, ensuring we create value for our shareholders. Let's now turn to Slide 9 and look at our current debt. Solid cash flow generation enables us to maintain a sound balance sheet. We are well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At the quarter end, liquidity was about $560 million with $170 million in cash and $390 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our total lease-adjusted leverage ratio of 5.1x, which is the high end of our targeted range, has increased over the past 3 years as planned to support shareholder payouts, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. Further, as previously stated, we expect leverage to temporarily exceed our target range in the short term due to costs associated with the REIT conversion. Our strong cash flows support continued advancement of our capital allocation strategy and our REIT conversion. In Q1, we paid $53 million in cash dividends and $10 million of REIT costs including REIT-related CapEx. We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy while advancing substantial payments to shareholders, and we remain well positioned to fund our business. So this concludes our review. In summary, Q1 was a good quarter, supported by sustained storage rental performance, continued high levels of profitability in our North American segments and strong International performance and recent acquisitions. We continue to execute against our strategy, extending our reach into high-growth emerging markets, driving continued profitable growth in our developed markets and prudently pursuing new business opportunities that are adjacent to our core business. And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from George Tong.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Could you provide some color on your organic storage revenue trends? I see they improved fractionally from last quarter, but the organic internal growth remains below your 2% historical range. Just some color on what drove performance in the quarter or when you might expect growth to return back to your 2% historical level.
William L. Meaney: George, thanks for your question. The 1.4%, and if you see our historical trends which were kind of 2%, 2.5%, I think we made a deliberate decision and you can see it in terms of our retention rates. Our retention rates are up about 30 basis points and when we were looking at renewing large enterprise customers, we look at retention, obviously, which is a key driver in terms of our long-term economic performance, the terms, in other words, how long those are. So for example, we just renewed a financial service client where we not only increased the volume that we have with that client, but we went from a normal 5-year contract to a 10-year contract. So we put all that into the mix when we look at that. So overall, what we're trying -- what we look at is optimizing or maximizing the revenue and profitability of our customers and we look at price, we look at volume and retention, we look at the length of the contract and the contract terms, all with a view in terms of building the durability of our business. So if you put that in the mix and you see where we've delivered on the OIBDA, so you said, well, historically, we were at 2%, 2.5%. We were at 1.4%, but we increased retention by 30 basis points and we still hit our OIBDA target. So it's a number of things, the variables that we look at. And when we look at these specific renewals, it made a lot more sense to make sure that we improved our retention rate, especially with a view of signing up longer contract terms.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: That's very helpful. And could you provide some additional detail on the organization realignment actions you've taken in the quarter and what benefits from a cost perspective you expect to see as a result?
William L. Meaney: I think that the -- first, it's consistent with what we said on an earlier call, I think, it was back in October when we discussed our reorganization, is that whilst there is a reduction in our cost base associated with it, that was not the motivation for our realignment. And the realignment was triggered back in October, but some of that is just falling through in terms of the restructuring costs in quarter 1 of 2014. So the reorganization was, for the most part, completed last year, but there were some kind of carry-on in terms of the first quarter. The main part of that was taking out 2 layers in our North American organization and mimicking what we have probably internationally that comes naturally around the country organization and we've instilled this -- installed something similar in the United States where we've put a lot more accountability into the local markets and that was really with a view to be more competitive in the mid-market segment. Combined with our acquisition of Cornerstone, those 2 things came together with the reorganization, as I say, again with a view to be more competitive and have more accountability going after the mid-sized segment.
Operator: I'll go to the next question. It is from Scott [indiscernible].
Unknown Analyst: I guess, following up on George's first question, I think you partially answered it. But we've seen a nice trend in terminations and destructions and you were talking about retention, but could you delve in a little bit more on the progress you've made there and what you're seeing?
William L. Meaney: I can -- maybe I'll give the first part of the answer and then let Rod emphasize because he was also referring to some of the tools that we've introduced. But we have brought in some more, I would say, sophisticated tools and then made some investments to better predict when we seem to be losing traction with customers. And when we go in early on, you have a much more, I would say, robust discussion, which includes how long we can renew the contract for. So we saw some contracts, which normally renew for 3 years and we renewed them for 5 years, as I highlighted just previously. We had a contract where we didn't have anywhere near the share of wallet that we do now. Actually, we went from having a fraction of their wallet to 100% of their wallet and instead of a 5-year contract to a 10-year contract. And when we look at that, that leads to not only better retention rates, which as we said you can see the results in this quarter. Whether you look at North America or you look at our overall business, we've improved retention rates by about 30 basis points. But in addition is we are gaining better terms and conditions in terms of the length of those contracts, which, as you know, for us, this is a -- it's all about the durability and low volatility of our business. And then, Rod, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.
Roderick Day: Well, just to build on that a little bit, Bill, there's really 2 sides to the equation here. Scott, one is we've invested in sort of predictive analytics to better understand the likelihood of customers terminating or destroying then trying to work with them in a more proactive way, both for our benefit as well as their benefit. And I do think we're seeing the consequences of that starting to come through in some of our key volumetrics. The other thing that we use to sort of build from that is to think more about the long-term value of the customer relationship rather than as sort of just a short-term quick win that we might try and get. So by thinking about that and then structuring that value into the contract over a longer period of time, again we think it's better for us and better for the customer. So hopefully, and I think we are operating in a more sort of sophisticated manner.
Unknown Analyst: Is this fairly broad based? Are you seeing any variances across the end markets, which you serve with regard to destructions and terminations, and for that matter, new business wins?
William L. Meaney: I think that probably the best way, you have to have a little bit of a helicopter view, especially our exposure to financial services where you have legal holes in specific markets that can skew the data one way or the other on any given period. I think we have to look at -- I think probably the better way to look at it is do we see a different trend, say, in North America versus our other developed markets, say, in Western Europe or Australia. And I would say that we see very consistent -- we're using similar approaches to the market that Rod just described and I would say we're seeing similar trends, almost identical trends, across both of those markets in the improvement that we're getting.
Unknown Analyst: And then, finally, if I could slip in one more. Just how is the pricing environment across storage and service, what you're seeing, what may be some of the pushbacks you're hearing from customers or are they fairly open to the strategies you're applying?
William L. Meaney: I think the price -- again, I'm going to let Rod maybe follow up. But I think, first of all, on the price is that, from our customers, is it's much more important in terms of what their overall, both quality and cost, of their whole records program is. And quality is about, obviously, making sure -- if you think about this as a safety deposit box for some of the most valuable documents for our customers, it's making sure that those things are stored in a way and can be retrieved in a timely fashion when they need them. And the other thing is to make sure they have a robust records management program, which means that they retain the things that they need to and they don't retain the things that they don't need to. So that's -- and then the other aspect is how much does that whole program cost? So those are the types of discussions that we have with our customers rather than on a specific price. I think, in any low-inflation environment is that everybody is driven by trying to get more productivity out of their operations and we're not immune to that like any other vendor. But the conversation we're having with our customers is how can we reduce the cost of their total program and at the same time, improve the quality of that program, which may mean lower volume for some customers in certain areas, but it definitely doesn't mean lower margin from our standpoint.
Roderick Day: I think that's right, Bill. Really, what we're trying to get at is what value can we bring to the customer? It's a complicated mix. It's not just storage, there's a whole lot of service elements that we provide as well. And as the industry leader, we're concerned to make sure we bring that value and demonstrate that value to the customer. So as part of our negotiations, it's a sort of wider and more holistic discussion, I suppose, rather than just a simple price discussion. And I think by doing that, it's good for us and it's good for the customer.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum.
Josh James - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: This is Josh James, actually, filling in for Shlomo. I just wonder if you could give us an update...
William L. Meaney: Shlomo, I'm sorry, can you just speak up? We're just barely hearing you.
Josh James - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: This is actually Josh James filling in for Shlomo. I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update on how the Cornerstone acquisition is progressing?
William L. Meaney: I think in terms of the integration, Josh, it's ahead of plan. I think the revenue is slightly lower than what we originally expected. But in terms of overall OIBDA delivery, it's -- we're comfortably ahead of plan. I mean, that was, in effect, much more similar to a large pickup and move. The other thing, as I alluded to earlier on the call, is where we've picked up significant benefit is insight on how our commercial operations can be better aligned to serving customers in what I would call the mid-market. So I think between those 2 things in terms of our ability to integrate and synergize it quicker than we thought and then also pick up some DNA about going after or aligning some of our commercial operations to the middle market, I would say it's gone quite well. I don't know, Rod, if you want to comment about on any of the financial?
Roderick Day: Yes, I mean, I think just on the revenue point, just to be clear, it was never that far off in terms of our expectations when we went into the deal sort of few hundred thousand. And actually, as we've been able to work with the business, that gap, if you like, has been closing as the months have progressed. So actually, I think we're encouraged by their performance, by what we've seen top line and bottom line pluses, as Bill said, very sort of secondary benefits in terms of better understanding of small and mid-market that we can gain from.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dan Dolev.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Question about North American OIBDA margins. They've been down a few quarters in a row. What would need to happen for North America margins to maybe bottom or start to reaccelerate at some point?
William L. Meaney: I think, it's really -- I'll let Rod comment more specifically, but it's really a tale of 2 stories. I think the OIBDA margins of North America haven't gone down when you look at our storage business. But as the business becomes more archival, then the service side of the business does take certain headwinds and there are 2 things going on: one is paper prices makes a fairly large impact on that, but the other thing is that as the business becomes more archival, whether you look at the RIM business or the DM business, is that you can only -- you can only be so proactive in terms of restructuring your cost base because you still have to service the customers until they become that less active. So it is kind of a thing where we can be proactive to a certain degree, but during this transition, until the declines in service revenue or the archival nature kind of flattens out in the business, there will continue to be pressure under the service side of the margins. But to be clear on the storage side is we are maintaining our margins on the storage side, and in fact, in most cases, improving them. So I don't know, Rod, if you want to...
Roderick Day: Yes, I think that's right. And you can see that a little bit in our numbers for the quarter actually. Because on the RIM side, the Records and Information Management side, if you look year-on-year, our margins actually improved by 50 basis points. And there's sort of 3 drivers of that, if you like. One is sort of ongoing good performance within storage. Two is the sort of slowdown in the rate of decline that we've seen in service within the RIM side of things. And three, sort of within that context, we've also been very proactive about taking out costs to try and sort of make sure we can maintain and enhance margin. So you can see that coming through in the RIM segment. If you look at Data Management, though, you do see a decline in margins, which is where the service decline is more accentuated at this point. And that presents us with a challenge, if you like, in terms [ph] of having to sort of take costs out as quickly as we can, so at least try and mitigate that impact. So it depends a little bit in terms of where we're at within the segment. But at least on the RIM side, we're up. And Data Management where we are seeing more of these service headwinds, we're down, but taking action on the cost side.
William L. Meaney: And I think on the -- the only thing I would just add to what Rod said is on the -- and if we look at Data Management, remember, we're talking about a base of 60% OIBDA margins on that business. And the storage component, whilst we've seen a decline as the business becomes -- tape is used much more for archive than backup purposes, we've seen an increase in our storage volume even though that tape format is becoming more efficient, et cetera. So we actually -- the amount of data that we're storing continues to grow. It's not for backup as much anymore, it's much more for archival. And you need to do this in the context that we're talking about at 60% margin business.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Andy Wittmann.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I didn't want to ask about your IRS process, but I did want to get your view on any implications or your thoughts really around the successful conversions of Lamar, CBS Outdoor and what that could potentially mean for the kind of overall thinking?
William L. Meaney: Well, that was a good way of, Andy, not asking a question about the REIT process. All I can say is we congratulate them both. I mean, we're in a completely different business segment, so I don't think you can read much into their process versus ours. But I appreciate the question.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I mean, what you gave us is fair and to hear that is actually helpful. Also wanted to get a thought, just kind of on that sales strategy for the mid-market, as well as what you did with the verticalization. Are you seeing benefits from that already or is that still yet to come? Just kind of your view of the success there.
William L. Meaney: I think that there's still a lot more to come. I think we are clearly seeing some. I mean, I think that the 30 basis points of improvement on retention -- don't forget, retention is almost the same as selling for us because of our presence and leadership in a lot of these segments, right. So retention is an important bellwether and it is getting closer to the customers through verticalization, through using better analytical tools that Rod discussed in his remarks. I think this is all starting to have a benefit. That being said, some of the things that we're doing around the middle market and even for a large enterprise customers, I think it's early days. As we discussed at Investor Day, we're in the process of standing up a central marketing operation under a chief marketing officer that's still being implemented. So I do think there are ways where, as a company, we can use our unique scale to further our leadership position and I think that there's more to be done, but we are starting to see some benefits, as we've highlighted, around retention.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Great. And then maybe just a final question, Rod. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of a flavor as to the acquisitions that you've done this year. I guess, we've kind of heard you've added some acquisitions, you've had some FX headwinds. No change to the guidance because, obviously, the annuity is large. But can you help us -- can you put a pencil to the paper on what the FX dollar headwind and the revenue benefit is from the acquisitions for the year?
Roderick Day: So approximately, for the acquisitions, we'd be looking at around $20 million, something like that. And there will be more detail in the 10-K on this. And similar kind of offset on the FX side.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And to be clear, the 2014 contributions, so it's partial year contribution from these acquisitions, not the run rate annualized contribution of revenue?
Roderick Day: No, sorry, that's annualized. But the fact is we sort of made these acquisitions fairly early in the year, so actually wouldn't be far off that number.
Operator: There are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to CEO, Bill Meaney, for closing remarks.
William L. Meaney: Thank you, operator. To wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter with strong constant dollar growth and margins. We have many attractive investment opportunities in order to grow our business over the long term and we'll do so prudently, consistent with our focused capital allocation approach. At the same time, we will continue to sustain the durability of our storage rental business, expand our presence in emerging markets and pursue attractive emerging business opportunities. We believe our durable platform and deliberate growth plan will continue to deliver opportunity and maximize total returns for our shareholders. Moreover, the value of these returns are further enhanced due to the higher certainty and lower volatility inherent in the nature of our business, which combines a durable and global customer base with superior scale. Thank you for joining us this morning.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Iron Mountain Q4 2013 Earnings Call Webcast. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'll now introduce your host for today's conference, Melissa Marsden. You may begin.
Melissa Marsden: Thank you, Nicole, and welcome, everyone, to our Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. And this morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and strategic initiatives; followed by Rod Day, CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. After prepared remarks, we will open up the phone for Q&A. And as is our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation available on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2014 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliation to these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, can be found, again, on the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. Before I turn the call over to Bill Meaney, I'd like to add 2 things. First, registration is now open for our Investor Day to be held on March 26 at the Pierre Hotel in New York. You can find registration details on the Investor Relations website under Events. And second, I'd like to thank Stephen Golden for his years of service to Iron Mountain, Investor Relations. As many of you know, he will be leaving Iron Mountain end of March, and I know you all join me in wishing him well in his future endeavors. Also, Colton Bria [ph], our new Director of IR, is here today and looking forward to working with you moving forward. With that, Bill, care to [ph] begin?
William L. Meaney: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning to everyone joining us today. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tragic fire that burned one of our record storage facilities outside Buenos Aires earlier this month. We're deeply saddened by the death of the very first responders who rushed to save our facility, as well as their colleagues injured while fighting the blaze. As reported, all Iron Mountain employees who worked in that facility are safe and accounted for. The building was equipped with both fire detection, as well as sprinkler systems, and we continue to work with authorities in participating fully in the investigation to understand what happened. Whilst this -- that is ongoing, our collective thoughts and prayers remain with the brave firefighters and their families and those injured fighting the blaze. I also wish to thank 4 employees of Iron Mountain who rushed into the fire to fight it until they were ordered to leave by the fire brigade. Their display of bravery, selflessness has been moving to all of us, and I am proud to be one of their colleagues. Turning now to performance of our business. We had a strong finish to the year. Financial results for the fourth quarter were in line with our expectations, excluding restructuring charges related to our organizational realignment. In addition, we achieved solid operating results as we advanced our strategy plan -- strategic plan to sustain the durability of our high-return business in developed markets, expanded into high-growth emerging markets and evaluated investment opportunities in promising emerging businesses. Total revenue for the quarter was USD 769 million, excluding charges of $19 million related to our organizational restructuring, which were in line the amount previewed in our third quarter report. Adjusted OIBDA was $214 million and adjusted earnings per share was $0.22 per share for the quarter. The execution of our reorganization went as planned, and we continue to maintain good cost discipline in the wake of these changes. It is early, but we expect the combination of these organizational changes, enhanced enterprise cost controls and the adjusted OIBDA improvement achieved in our International businesses to support our continued high level of profitability. In our International business, all regions ended the year in line with or ahead of expectations to deliver the adjusted OIBDA improvement target of 25% established 3 years ago. To put that into perspective, this achievement represents improvement of roughly USD 100 million in annualized OIBDA over that time frame. Our fourth quarter results were slightly impacted by foreign currency fluctuations and decreases in paper pricing. We continue to monitor these factors as we move into 2014. But at present, the impact is not significant enough to warrant adjustments to our 2014 full year outlook. Overall, business fundamentals for the fourth quarter, excluding restructuring charges, were in line with our expectations and fairly consistent with trends in the recent quarters. Constant dollar storage rental growth for the quarter was quite strong at 4.9%, driven by 12.5% growth in International and consistent 2.2% growth in North America. Total storage rental internal growth was 1.3% in the fourth quarter. This growth rate was impacted by contract renewals and some upfront costs associated with competitive win. Our outlook for storage rental internal growth in 2014 remains consistent with the 2% to 2.5% level we've seen in recent periods. Flow through from acquisition activity earlier in the year was a meaningful growth driver. We continue to view acquisitions as an important element of our strategy to extend our durable storage rental revenue. We closed on more than USD 320 million of transactions globally during the year whilst building a robust pipeline of additional opportunity. In all cases, our M&A activities must exceed our cost capital and follow our return on invested capital guideline. In developed markets, our leading platform of people, properties and services allows us to quickly and accretively integrate acquisitions and achieve targeted returns. During the fourth quarter, we closed on our acquisition of Cornerstone Records Management in the U.S. As we work through the integration of Cornerstone, revenue for the period -- partial period was just shy of our target, whilst OIBDA contribution came in slightly ahead of expectations. Additionally, the first storage facility consolidation from this acquisition occurred in late January, and we have several more plans for the first half of the year, helping us to more quickly realize the integration benefits versus our original plan. As we've noted, we expect this transaction to build attractive bold and economic ROIC of [ph] 10% plus, which translates into the mid-teens in terms of equity returns. In emerging markets, our strategy remains to acquire or partner with local storage companies to expand our market leadership, enhance returns and capture the initial wave of records outsourcing in these markets. These acquisitions also provide new business from local customers and deepen our relationships with multinational customers who increasingly seek the security and efficiency that can be gained by consolidating records and information management with one global provider. Late in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Databox in China. Whilst a relatively small transaction, this deal provides its platform from which we can thoroughly investigate the broader market opportunity and learn from our new customers and employees. It also provides entry into several key cities, including Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Chongqing, which are in addition to our current locations in China, mainly Hong Kong and Shenzhen. This transaction is addition to 4 deals we successfully on-boarded in Latin America in 2013, which will bring in roughly USD 60 million in annualized revenue. In all cases, we are on track with our business models, which are based upon exceeding risk-adjusted hurdle rates, which exceed our cost of capital. We have a strong pipeline of additional opportunities in emerging markets. Whilst these markets represent just 10% of our total business today with a 23% increase in constant dollar storage rental growth for the year, they are an important part of our long-term growth strategy and offer significant expansion potential. With regard to emerging businesses, we are on track construction of our first data center outside of Boston and expect to bring it online before the end of the second quarter. As we noted in our 2014 guidance, we expect to invest roughly USD 40 million in this business in 2014, doing so in phases to minimize risk. And our recent wins and pipeline of deals support our capital plan for the year. It's early days, but at present, pricing and returns appear healthy in our target segments. We'll have more on this emerging business in our Investor Day in late March, but we are pleased with the progress we're making and the response from both new as well as our current data protection customers. Let me briefly touch upon our preparations for REIT conversion. Our actual REIT capital and operating expenditures came in within the range we projected back in 2012, and we have successfully completed the internal work necessary to enable us to comply with REIT requirements. Following roughly 6 months of dry run and [ph] testing, we began operating in a manner consistent with being a REIT as of 1 January 2014. License to your appreciation [ph] and thanks to all who have worked tirelessly to get us to this point. By all measures, this is a massive undertaking, and we brought the project in on time and on budget. Of course, we don't control every step of the process, and we don't yet have final written rulings from the IRS on our outstanding private letter ruling or PLR. However, we took these steps to prepare us for a decision, help preserve the related tax benefits for our stockholders for 2014 and to be able to demonstrate REIT compliance on a look-back basis should we ultimately be successful in converting. As I noted on last quarter's call, we don't intend to provide interim updates as to the nature of our communications with the IRS, and we cannot make any assurances that the IRS will ultimately provide us with a favorable ruling on our racking structure or other requests. Once again, the REIT structure does not impact our strategy or how we execute it. It enhances our return. Our strategy continues to be focused on sustaining the durability of the business, maximizing free cash flow and supporting attractive stockholder returns regardless of whether or not we ultimately convert. We generate significant free cash flow, and the amount we have available pursuing strategic investment isn't appreciably different as a REIT or a C-Corp. We have many attractive opportunities to invest to grow the business over the long term and we'll do so prudently, consistent with our capital allocation focus. As we advance our strategic plan, I wish to reiterate that we are committed to enhancing long-term shareholder return under either a REIT or a C-Corp structure. Over the long term, we will strive for consistent, moderate dividend growth whilst permitting the flexibility to pursue high-return investment. As we look out to this year, we are reiterating our guidance, which assumes solid constant dollar revenue growth and adjusted OIBDA growth in line with the long-term goals we've talked about in the past. We see consistent trends for storage rentals in North America and a moderation in the rate of service activity decline. Internationally, we are improving our commercial focus as being a good trajectory as we move into 2014, driven by both organic growth and high-returning acquisition. To summarize, we had a solid quarter punctuated by the closing of additional acquisitions, achievement of further milestones related to the REIT preparedness and progress on the execution of our realignment and implementation of our strategic plan. We believe our plan will help us sustain the durability of the business and support long-term growth. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rod.
Roderick Day: Thanks, Bill, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Let's now turn to Slide 3, which highlights key messages of today's review. We had good results in quarter 4 supported by strong constant dollar storage rental growth and international profit gains, as well as benefits from recent acquisitions in Latin America and North America. Storage rental growth grew 5% on a constant dollar basis in the quarter supported by a consistent 2% gain in North America and 13% growth in International. Adjusted OIBDA performance was in line with expectations in Q4, driven by our International business, which achieved its 3-year margin improvement goal, and by sustained cost management. Included in our fourth quarter adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS is $19 million restructuring [ph] charges as discussed on our last earnings call. Looking at the full year, our revenue adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS results all landed in our guidance ranges. CapEx was a bit higher than originally expected, as we accelerated capital projects from 2014 into 2013. And free cash flow benefited from lower cash taxes due to timing of payments. Today, we are reiterating our 2014 full year guidance put forth at our Q3 earnings call. We continue to expect, call it, constant dollar growth of 2% to 4% of total revenues and 2% to 5% for adjusted OIBDA. Let's move on to Slide 4 to review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the fourth quarter of 2012. Q4 operating results were generally in line with our expectations and consistent with recent trends. Enterprise revenues were 3% on a constant dollar basis, as our International segment continues to produce strong result. International posted 10% constant dollar revenue growth supported by 13% storage rental growth, including benefits from our recent acquisitions in Colombia and Peru. North America posted flat constant dollar revenue growth, as 2% storage rental gains were offset by lower complementary service revenues. FX rate changes reduced revenue growth by approximately 130 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted OIBDA was $214 million, up 3%, excluding the $19 million restructuring charge. A key driver of profit performance was continued improvement in our International segments where adjusted OIBDA, excluding $4 million of restructuring charges, increased 32% year-on-year in Q4. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.15 per share or $0.22 per share, excluding restructuring charges, compared to $0.20 in Q4 2012. Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS, excluding the impact of costs associated with the REIT conversion, which reduced reported EPS by $0.04 per share net of tax. GAAP earnings per share, $0.25, including $40 million of REIT costs, $11 million of other expense and a tax benefit related to foreign dividends, favorable all-in [ph] settlements and released certain valuation reserves. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 39%. Let's now take a look -- close look at our revenue on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows the components building to our overall revenue growth. For the quarter, storage rental growth of 4.9% on a constant dollar basis drove overall revenue performance. Year-on-year global net volume growth was 5.8%, including a 4.5% benefit from our 2013 acquisition. North America reported 2.2% constant dollar storage rental growth, reflecting relatively flat records for management volume, pricing of just under 1% and benefits from our recent acquisition. North American pricing gains were below recent quarters, reflecting impacts from contract renewals and some upfront costs associated with competitive win. For the full year, pricing gains were 1.3%. International storage rental growth was 12.5% on a constant dollar basis for the quarter, reflecting a 29% growth in emerging markets supported by strong organic growth in [ph] benefits from acquisitions. Internal storage rental growth remained strong with a 6.3% gain in the quarter. Total service revenues, down 40 basis points on a constant dollar basis and International service growth, supported by acquisitions, was offset by North American service declines driven by lower complementary service revenues. Average paper prices declined 13% year-on-year, resulting in a $5 million less revenue in Q4. For the full year, average paper prices were down 10%. Overall, total internal growth was negative 1.1% in Q4 as 1.3% gains in storage rental was more than offset by 4.4% service declines. Let's now move to Slide 6 and review our full year results. Slide 6 looks at our full year 2013 performance compared to 2012. Our results reflect consistent business trends with reported revenue of $3.03 billion, up 2% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted OIBDA, excluding restructuring charges of $23 million, was up 1% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EPS of $1.03 per share, down 15% compared to 2012. This reflects the impact of restructuring charges, full year impact of additional shares issued with a special dividend in November 2012 and higher interest expense. These impacts more than offset lower income tax expense. Capital spending for the year was $223 million, excluding $66 million of real estate and $23 million of REIT conversion capital. As a percent of revenues, CapEx, excluding real estate and REIT CapEx, is 7.4%. Capital spending finished slightly higher than guidance, as we accelerated certain projects, including sustainability projects from 2014 into 2013. Free cash flow for 2013 was $390 million compared to $347 million last year. The year-on-year increase reflects lower cash taxes, which were partially offset by high capital spending. The 2013 adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS results here shown excludes $83 million of costs associated with the REIT conversion. These costs reduced [ph] reported EPS by approximately $0.30. In addition to the $23 million of REIT-related capital expenditures [ph], we paid $53 million in taxes towards our D&A REIT capital liability. All told, these items reduced free cash flow by $130 million. We've included a slide outlining the actual and expected REIT costs and related expenditures in the appendix for this presentation. Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review our results by segment. Slide 7 shows the metrics for each of our 3 segments comparing 2013 to 2012. Consistent with our business strategy, we're sustaining higher returns in our North American segments, where we continue to build our International segment, a significant driver of profit and cash flow gain. North America continues to deliver high profit and strong cash. For 2013, our North American business segment reported revenues of $2.2 billion. We sustained adjusted OIBDA margins of 41% as increased storage gross margins and SG&A savings offset restructuring costs and pressures from the lower service revenues. We're also sustaining capital efficiencies. We're spending 5.5% of revenues, including real estate. Our International segment continues to post strong constant dollar revenues, adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gain. Adjusted OIBDA increased 19% on a constant dollar basis, benefiting from solid global growth and cost improvement initiatives in Western European markets. International adjusted OIBDA margins have expanded more than 300 basis points, excluding the impacts of restructuring costs in 2013, as we achieved our goal of 25% International segment margin. Finally, corporate expenses were up compared to prior years driven by the restructuring costs and increase in people and professional fees. Let's now take a look at our debt statistic on Slide 8. Solid cash flow generation enabled us to maintain a sound balance sheet. We are well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was more than $900 million with $120 million in cash and $820 million in additional borrowing capacity. As discussed on our last call, in the amendment of our credit agreements, we changed our consolidated leverage ratio for compliance purposes to a net total lease adjusted leverage ratio, which is an EBITDAR-based calculation that adds leases [ph] to our total debt. This better aligns with how rating agencies view our leverage. At the end of Q4, that ratio was 5.0 with a requirement not to exceed 6.5. To align with this new calculation, we're establishing a target of net total lease adjusted leverage range of 4 to 5. This equates to our previous range of 3 to 4, excluding lease financing. Our net total lease adjusted leverage ratio of 5.0x, which is at the high end of our target range, has increased over the past 3 years, as planned, to support shareholder payout, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. Further, as previously stated, we expect leverage to temporarily exceed our target range in the short term due to costs associated with REIT conversion. Our strong cash flow for the quarter continued advance on [ph] our cash allocation strategy and our REIT conversion. In 2013, we paid $207 million in cash dividends and $159 million of REIT costs, including REIT-based CapEx and tax payments related to the depreciation of recapture. We are managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy while advancing financial payout to [ph] shareholders, and we remain well positioned to fund our business plan. Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a review of our 2014 outlook. Slide 9 summarizes our 2014 operating outlook. As I mentioned earlier today, we're reiterating our full year 2014 guidance. We're expecting full year revenues of $3.09 billion to $3.17 billion and adjusted OIBDA of $930 million to $960 million. Our expectations for adjusted EPS and free cash flow remain the same as well. As we have been highlighting, we are incurring significant onetime operating capital costs associated with our potential conversion to a REIT. These costs relate to systems investments, legal and tax work, advisory fees and other miscellaneous costs to implement the proposed structure. We invested to ensure that we met the January 1, 2014, deadline in compliance with all REIT requirements. We have met that deadline. We were able to delay certain costs, primarily associated with additional country conversions, and now expect between $32 million and $47 million being heard [ph] in 2014, and we're tightening our guidance range to $185 million to $200 million of these REIT costs. We are also tightening the range for our depreciation recapture payments to $210 million to $225 million. We report -- we have included a table with these REIT-related costs in the appendix for your reference. That concludes our review. In summary, Q4 was a good quarter supported by strong international performance and the recent acquisition. Our full year performance was in line with our guidance. We continue to execute our business plan with the same high profit and cash flow in North America, driving strong growth and higher return in our International business. We continue to advance work in connection with REIT conversion as part of our long-term approach to enhance value creation for shareholders. Thank you. We'd now be happy to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Could you guys just provide us with some thoughts with regards to the margin kind of bouncing around the quarter? But congratulations on the 25% target achievement. What do you see going forward? What are the -- what could be better to help or be a hindrance as we look out into 2014 and beyond?
Roderick Day: Is that question specifically related to International or the business as a whole?
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: No, the International. I'm sorry if I didn't specify.
Roderick Day: Yes, so on International, we expect further improvements in the International margin. Really, it's a continuation of the strategy that we've been having, and it builds leadership positions in the markets in which we operate. And from that, it enabled us to drive high margins off the back of it. So we see continued improvement on that side.
William L. Meaney: One thing, Scott, just to give you a bit of extra flavor to that is that what we're talking about is in terms of the current portfolio. But the other side of it, which we always say on the International side, is that we're constantly adding new -- well, I shouldn't say new markets, but new acquisitions in the pipeline. So as we -- it's a portfolio play if you will. So in other words that if we look at our most pure market [indiscernible], the markets where we've established some key positions that Rod had alluded to, is those returns already mimic what we see in North America, for instance. When we actually enter a new market and -- or build out our capacity market like what we're doing in Brazil, we see a regular input [ph] in terms of those margins over time. But we also need to understand that as we actually go into new markets that we start at one end of the spectrum and then build it to the other. The only thing I would just say is in all those cases, though, is we go in to the view that we have to exceed even on the initial acquisitions our return on -- our hurdle in terms of return on capital. But over time, even beyond the initial returns on invested capital, we see the returns start mimicking what we get. North America hasn't hit those market leading positions if that makes sense.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Switching up a bit. Service is still moving along. I've realized a little bit of headwind for paper prices. Could you speak a little bit to trends you're seeing with retrievals, with construction? And then also, evident to the special project, that could be picking up, and historically, I think you view that as potentially a precursor for more activity in the business and including [ph] the storage. Just any color you can provide along this line.
Roderick Day: Yes, I mean, we did see some moderation in the rate of decline of service activities as we ended [ph] second half of 2013. And that continues. And as we worked our way through into Q4, I think we're nervous about calling it a big fundamental shift in the business in terms of a change in trend. But at least, there was continuation of a slightly more positive sign through Q4.
William L. Meaney: Yes. And then coming, Scott, to your question about DMS or related service and how it drives storage, I think that there's kind of 2 parts to that. I think, first and foremost, is that our customers are much more interested in solutions that we provide around their whole information management requirement, hence the reason why, over a year ago, we started going to a much more vertical process in terms of how we align our sales force to our customers. We've talked about that on previous calls in terms of the industry verticals that we had. And one of the main reasons for that is to be able to address for our larger enterprise customers those requirements that they have around a total solution. So there, you're absolutely right. I think, especially in emerging markets, we have seen a very strong link in terms of providing those services in additional storage. But I think this is -- it's very much related to our vertical strategy in addressing a solution around information management beyond just storing the physical document or electronic information.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Tong of Piper Jaffray.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Storage rental internal growth this quarter decelerated to 1.0% [ph], which is below your 2%-plus growth in prior quarters. Is this something we should be concerned about?
Roderick Day: I think what we saw in Q4 was there was a number of pricing actions that we took around some contract wins and some contract renewals, which resulted in a number of payments that we did announce that will be made in the beginning of the contract. We sort of had a slight dampening effect in Q4. I think for the outlook for 2014, we're expecting to get back more to the sort of 2% range we've seen historically.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Got it. That's very helpful. And then switching gears to the Wholesale Data Center business. Could you just give us a little bit of color there in terms of initiatives? How much capital you have planning -- are you planning to allocate, how much customer commitments you have lined up?
William L. Meaney: Okay. So I think on that, George, is that -- I think we're still consistent with the guidance that we've given previously, that we're allocating about USD 40 million worth of CapEx for 2014. And the way you should think about that is about 80-20. Now the 80% of that is linked to strong or high visibility around customer commitments or requirements. 20% is, what I would call, kind of fundamental infrastructure. So we're still very much driven by making sure that we have customers that are leading the vast majority of our CapEx in that business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Just to circle back to the core services. What are you modeling for paper prices in '14, number one? And then number two, was there any weather impact? Because it seems like between a $5 million headwind from paper in Q4, there was probably some weather-related impact, I'd imagine, on the service activity levels. It's probably firmer than what those numbers suggest. So I'm trying to reconcile why we're headed into, call it, a bottom, when it seems like fundamentals are improving pretty steadily there.
Roderick Day: Maybe I'll start with the paper price. We're not calling really any up or down on that but started off as paper. We saw $133 a ton [ph] in Q4, baked in [ph] our projections. We're going to project that forward as opposed to making extrapolations up or down. SO obviously, if it was to improve, that will good. If it goes down further [indiscernible] is the negative. So that's kind of how we view the outlook. In terms of service...
William L. Meaney: Yes. And Kevin, on the service side, we did see some weather-related impact. It's the winter that keeps giving in the Northeast, especially tough on, actually, throughout the country. So we have seen some of that, but we don't try to project much into that. I think that the -- I think that's fair to say. But I think also, if you unpack our service revenue to a certain degree, as Rod said previously, if you look at the, what we would call, kind of the retrievals and re-files, which is the kind of the core part of our service revenue, we do see a flattening out of the decreasing trend in that part of the business. The paper trend as -- is probably the biggest single impact in terms of our service revenue for Q4, which Rod highlighted, down from previous year, associated with some specific projects, which are related to our document management services. But you're right to call out that weather has put a certain amount of headwinds on our service revenue in Q4.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Understood. And then, hey, Bill, in terms of the REIT, when is the last -- like what's the last day of 2014 where it can be retroactive to the first of the year? So I guess, said another way, what date does that PLR need to come in where it can still be effective for all of 2014?
William L. Meaney: I was waiting for a question on the REIT. We finally got it. It's in actually, I believe, October 2015. Rod will keep me honest, because it's when we actually have to file our return for 2014 with all the normal conventions. So it's roughly, I think, October 2015. Is that -- Rod, do you agree with that?
Roderick Day: Yes, yes.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Got it. And then just one other thing on that. It looks like on the outlook, you pulled, for lack of a better word, in the Q3 slide deck, kind of the outlook at 2014 to 2016 across the REIT related and other expenditures. Now it's all coming into 2014. What drove that change? Is that just better visibility? Or any -- or am I overanalyzing anything there?
William L. Meaney: I think you're probably overanalyzing it and anything there [ph]. We're just now showing guidance for 2014. And then assuming that we have a positive ruling from the IRS is there will be ongoing REIT costs associated with not just supporting the normal recording for a REIT but also as we convert more countries from a TRS to a QRS. So I think you're overanalyzing. We're just showing the guidance now for 2014.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Helpful. And then what if -- if you do the E&P, would that be similar in mix in terms of stock versus cash as what you did the first time?
William L. Meaney: Yes, yes, exactly.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wanted to go back to storage rental internal growth, which decelerated like a point to the 1.3. I know you anticipate it to go back to 2, 2.5 for 2014. I just don't see why the type of pricing that you're talking about, initial pricing on contract, would only affect one quarter.
William L. Meaney: I think as Rod kind of alluded to on the first thing, Andrew, was it was related to a few specific large customer renewals and retroactive decreases we had to give associated with that, which we took the impact in Q4. So it's a -- very specific around a couple of large customers. And so we have visibility going out for the rest of the 2014 and can -- those are much more one-off adjustments.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. And when you're in the renewal environment, even if you have to make those type of adjustments retroactively, are there price escalators built into the out years of the long-term contract that you're seeing recently?
William L. Meaney: It depends on the contract, Andrew. But you're right to say that, generally, we use the escalators that are high to CPI. But it depends on how long the contract is for and it's a mix. But generally, what you're saying is correct.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, when we talk about the fourth quarter, that's mostly just that price retroactivity that you just talked about. When you look at volume growth for storage internal growth, is there much change there?
William L. Meaney: No. Actually, the volume growth remains on track. It clearly is related to a couple specific, large contract renewals.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And Rod, if you'll entertain this question because I get it a fair bit. It's about AFFO. And I know we talked about it at last Analyst Day, and the company presented around that. When you look at the company free cash flow guide of $300 million to $340 million, what factors should investors take into account when trying to calculate AFFO?
Stephen P. Golden: Andrew, Steve here. Look, you're talking about a couple of different things. But the biggest differences between what kind of a basic AFFO would and the way we report our free cash flow is obviously taxes. It is a full burden of taxes in our free cash flow does not exist, to a large extent, in an AFFO calculation. And additionally, the AFFO only subtracts out maintenance CapEx from the cash generated by the business. And in our free cash flow calculation, we subtract maintenance CapEx, as well as normal growth and other sorts of things, excluding the real estate. So those are the 2 big differences between the 2 cash flow base number.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And just -- I know the figure that we used in the past when talking about maintenance CapEx, but is the definition for AFFO different than Iron Mountain's previous comments, older comments on how much of your CapEx is maintenance CapEx?
Stephen P. Golden: No, not really. The definition should be the same. We will -- in a REIT scenario, we will likely report it slightly different. We'll indicate what portion of that maintenance CapEx refers specifically to real estate and what portion refers to other on non-real estate assets. This should remain the same.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the Cornerstone acquisition, and I understand that the -- usually, the first stage of the acquisition is go ahead and integrate it in order to get the cost synergies. But I was just wondering if there are initiatives right now to kind of broaden the tail space over there and to try and go after the end market, which is not historically kind of a paramount end market?
William L. Meaney: Shlomo, this is Bill. Yes -- no, I think it's the question. I think that, that was one of the key attractiveness for us on Cornerstone. There were really kind of 2 aspects. One is the operational aspect, which we've highlighted, is that -- and we're actually nicely ahead of plan in terms of being able to get that. The other part was the fact that Cornerstone had a very good representation in the middle market part of the business. In part of our realignment of strategy, which we talked about, I think on the last call and throw in some more detail on the Investor Day, was really that is getting much more focused through the 19 regions that we've set up across North America to go after that middle market, and Cornerstone fits very nicely into that initiative. So that's where their sweet spot was.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: So are you already -- you already started building out kind of the tails over there? Or are we still kind of early stages, it takes time to build the business?
William L. Meaney: No. We've already done that. In fact, we've already integrated a number of their sales people into our organization, both on the -- boots on the ground, as well as some of the performance management associated with that to go after that market. That's actually already complete.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, and then just Slide 11, the $500 million to $1 billion of estimated E&P distribution, is that a total number? Or is this kind of an incremental number? Just want to understand that. For 2014.
Roderick Day: That's incremental.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: So it should be a total of $500 million to $1 billion that'll come in 2014 and a similar type of mix as to what we saw years ago?
William L. Meaney: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev of Jefferies.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I've got one quick housekeeping question and a follow-up. So would you mind, like in previous quarters, break out North America organic storage growth versus International in Q4?
Roderick Day: We don't have enough time. We'll get back to you on it.
Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Another question, Recall, a big competitor of yours, reported results earlier this week. I think they had about 2.8% constant currency growth excluding M&A. Yours is probably like 1.5% or so lower in the last 2 quarters. Is there -- is that a mix issue? Is there anything else that we should be thinking about when comparing the companies? Any color would be great.
Roderick Day: Well, obviously, Recall had less storages in America compared to International relative to what I know -- what we know without bearing on the result.
William L. Meaney: Yes, yes, because you have to understand, their record, their pure records management size in North America is about 1/10 of ours, so it's -- as Rod said, they're more biased towards the International market.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just had a question around the acquisitions pipeline. And obviously, you guys did a fair number, $320 million this year. How should we expect that based on what you're seeing today? Should that annual spend be in the next digit level relative to I think it was the 100 to 150 you guys have guided on the last Investor Day?
William L. Meaney: I think that the -- Manav, I think that the guidance that we gave at the last Investor Day is the right general expectation. I think at Investor Day, coming up in March, we'll give you a better view in terms of where we think we're going to end up over the next 3 years in terms of our acquisition pipeline because we have built a pretty robust pipeline mainly focused at the emerging markets. So our focus is to primarily grow the emerging markets which tend to be smaller in size but in higher growth areas. So I think that the guidance that we gave last time, I think, still is the right general guidance. And I think we'll give you more color in terms of what the impact of our acquisition pipeline should look like over the next 3 years when we all meet at the end of March.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And just on the Chinese acquisition, I mean, could you maybe just bring in the size of either that acquisition, your market, your presence relative today and what that could mean?
William L. Meaney: Yes. Actually, I just came back from China, so I can give you a little bit of an update on that, is that the -- first of all, it's a nice little acquisition. As we said, this is -- it's not massive, but it actually builds out our location across China and gives us a similar footprint as our other, what I would call, international competitors or a little bit bigger than some of our international competitors in China. So we feel pretty good about that. I think that the -- I think it's fair to say right now with our China footprint, we have a footprint that is attractive and meets the requirements of our international clients. But we're still not, what I would call, a buyer for SOEs, state-owned enterprise. And there, there are larger and local competitors that are serving state-owned enterprise markets. So right now, it's early days in China, but we feel good that we've now got a platform that, first of all, can satisfy our international customer base; and second, gives us a lot more intel on the ground in terms of better opportunities. But we're still what I wouldn't call a large book provider of services for the state-owned enterprise.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And just one last one just sort of on the Recall now spinning off. Have you seen any change in strategy or more competition for these acquisitions that you're going after that [ph] at all?
William L. Meaney: I think, so far, we haven't. I mean, I know they announced a couple of acquisitions this past week. They -- I mean, they were always -- they were a good competitor before they spun out. They're, I'm sure, going to continue to be a good competitor now that they've spun out. So I can't say there'd be any change. I think that they will, I think, like us, be very disciplined in terms of the way that they allocate capital, especially now that they're a public company. So I don't see any major change or anything like that.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jay Remig [ph] of Wall Street Journal.
Unknown Attendee: I just wanted to see if you could fill us in on the status on the investigation in the fire at your new warehouse in Buenos Aires and if there's any kind of indication of the cause of that fire, if they're trying to -- if there was possibly arson involved or not. If you could just kind of fill us in how that's going.
William L. Meaney: I think, first and foremost, is that we've been working with the authorities to assist in any way that we can to their investigation. So is this being led by, obviously, the local authorities. So we don't have any information other than what's already out there that has been released by the authorities. But I think it would be wrong for us to even speculate at this point. We can't really go beyond what we've said, it did have fire detection, fire suppression systems in the operation. We did have security guards on duty 24 hours, so there were people monitoring the facility. But this is clearly a very tragic event, and the only thing I would just add is that nobody spends more than we do in terms of trying to prevent these types of occurrences. But at this point, we're cooperating with the authorities. Like them, we want to find out what the root cause was.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions in the queue.
William L. Meaney: Okay. Well, thank you very much, operator. In summary, we had a good quarter and wrapped up a solid year, underscoring the durability of our storage rental business. We began to execute on our recent organization realignment and advance initiatives to extend the durability of our business. This included acquisitions in both the emerging and the developed markets that will generate attractive returns on our capital as we integrate these businesses into our core and additional investments in the emerging data center business. These initiatives are consistent with our continued focus on prudent capital allocation and maximizing total return, and we believe they will support sustainable long-term growth and allow us to deliver durable returns to our shareholders. We look forward to sharing more details with you at our upcoming Investor Day, and thank you for joining us this morning.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's call, and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Iron Mountain Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I'll now introduce your host for today's conference, Melissa Marsden. You may begin.
Melissa Marsden: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And this morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights for the quarter and strategic initiatives, followed by Brian McKeon, our CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. Rod Day, acting CFO, and Stephen Golden, VP, IR, are also with us today. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2 of that presentation, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2013 and 2014 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results and the reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures as required by Reg G can be found at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Meaney.
William L. Meaney: Thanks, Melissa, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Before we begin, I wish to congratulate the Red Sox. Sorry for those of you that aren't fans, better luck next year. It was a great season and a great win. I couldn't ask for more after being out of the country for 27 years and coming back home to see the Sox win the World Series. So let's just hope that the other Boston teams do as well this year. Now back to business. During the third quarter, we continued to work on advancing our strategy by sustaining the durability of our business through attractive core acquisitions and supporting the long-term growth through expansion into fast-growing emerging markets and selective investment in emerging businesses. Our financial results were in line with our expectations, with a total revenue of $756 million, adjusted OIBDA of $240 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.31 per share. We did incur some costs related to the implementation of our strategy, although our underlying performance remains solid and consistent with the recent trends. I'll cover these charges at a high level, and then Brian will have more on how they impact our outlook, as well as the impact from recent acquisitions on our guidance for the remainder of 2013. The changes we -- the charges we took in the third quarter and expect to take in the fourth quarter relate to some realignment within our organizational structure, with a view towards speed and simplicity. These changes will help fuel our growth strategy by consolidating activities, both within and across units, thereby eliminating duplication, increasing spans and reducing layers throughout the organization. Additionally, these changes will reduce operating costs to mitigate anticipated core service revenue declines and cost inflation, and will provide the financial resources for investment in new areas that are adjacent to our core activities. We also booked early debt extinguishment charges related to our successful August refinancing activities, which we undertook to align our capital structure with our long-term strategy in order to both lower our cost of capital and extend maturity. This was a tremendous accomplishment, particularly as our treasury team was amending and upsizing our senior credit facility at the same time. Setting aside the charges for a moment, it was a good quarter, which we continued to build on the core strengths of our organization and enhance our platform for long-term growth and sustainable returns. And we continued to make good progress with initiatives that support each of the 3 main pillars of our strategic priority. As a reminder, those priorities are: driving continued profitability growth in our mature markets; further penetration in the emerging markets; and identifying, incubating and scaling emerging businesses. Earlier this month, we gathered the senior leadership of the company to sharpen our focus on the strategic priorities that will drive our business in the future and to ensure that our plans for execution are closely aligned with those priorities. We have more detail -- we will have more detail on the specific initiatives at our Investor Day in March. And as we refine our execution plans, we will continue to pursue opportunities that align with the 3 pillars I just described. For example, you saw our announcement a couple of weeks ago about our acquisition of Cornerstone Records Management for a total consideration of USD 191 million. Cornerstone has a good business, with storage representing more than 60% of its revenues, and a strong presence amongst small and mid-sized customers in the U.S. We expect the transaction to yield attractive fold-in economics, with ROIC of the 10% plus range, above our cost of capital, which translates into mid-teens equity returns. We do expect to incur some incremental capital and move costs as we realize real estate synergies over time. And OIBDA from this transaction should reach USD 30 million on a fully integrated basis. We were also active with acquisitions in the international markets during the quarter. In August, we announced the acquisition of the Colombian records management and data protection business of G4S, the market leader in Colombia, for USD 54 million. The acquisition represents our entry into Colombia, one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America, and is consistent with our objective to grow our presence and achieve market leadership in attractive emerging markets. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of File Service in Peru, valued at USD 16 million, which advances us to the leading position in that country as well. These transactions offer the potential for future benefits as we integrate them into our existing Latin American business, which includes operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. Also during the quarter, we acquired a small data protection business in France. In total, we have completed acquisitions totaling approximately USD 320 million thus far in 2013, with roughly $220 million of that in the mature markets of the U.S., France, and $100 million in emerging markets. Growing our presence in emerging markets is an important part of our long-term growth strategy, as constant dollar revenue growth in emerging markets during Q3 was 23%, with 15% internal growth. In addition, we continue to evaluate the potential of emerging businesses, with data centers representing our most significant investment to date. During the quarter, we broke ground on our first regional data center in Northborough, Massachusetts, just outside Boston, at our existing campus for record storage. This data center is being built to satisfy stringent security and compliance requirements that we believe will be attractive to many highly regulated organizations in industries such as health care, biotech and financial services. We are making good progress with building our base from which to scale this business. And in total, we expect to invest roughly USD 40 million in the data center business in 2014. As we were considering frameworks for enhancing our focus on emerging adjacent businesses, we noticed a common construct and best practice amongst leading innovative companies. To help support leaders with launching and running their new businesses, they typically appoint senior, seasoned executives to lead these efforts. In keeping with that best practice, we are creating a new executive position with Harry Ebbighausen, who's currently President of North America, taking on formal responsibility for emerging businesses effective the beginning of next year. Harry has the track record and respect within the organization to champion these efforts and make sure we are leveraging our resources and capabilities wherever possible. We are splitting Harry's current role into 2 areas: 1 focused on physical records management and another focused on data protection and recovery. This separation of roles will align responsibilities with our growth strategy and provide more discrete focus on product lines. John Tomovcsik, or JT, will take on responsibility for records management, DMS and shred for North America. JT, currently Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for North America, has been with the company for more than 27 years in various operations and sales roles, spanning multiple product lines. He also leads North American operations as one of the primary leaders behind the group's continuous improvement model, which drove significant profitability increases between 2007 and 2010. In addition to this focus around product lines, we will be leveraging our global capabilities in a more coordinated way, in areas such as product management marketing, for example, with the goal of maintaining continuity and exploiting our global scale and knowledge whilst operating more efficiently. We may have further realignment of our organization as we continue to refine our execution plan. We'll have more color on this in March. Turning now to our progress with preparations for REIT conversion. We successfully completed the integration of REIT-critical IT systems on July 1. We are continuing the internal work necessary to ensure compliance with the REIT tests, even if we don't have final written rulings from the IRS on our outstanding PLRs, or private letter rulings, prior to January 1. However, we won't be disclosing REIT-related metrics or reporting externally as a REIT until such time as the IRS's final decision is rendered. As I noted on last quarter's call, we aren't providing interim updates as we move through the process with the IRS. As most of you are aware, we have several PLRs in the queue. To the extent that we were to receive verbal indications of rulings throughout the normal give-and-take review process on some of these PLRs, it could be misinterpreted if we were to disclose partial information prior to having formal confirmation from the IRS on all matters necessary to convert. Although we don't yet have clarity on our outstanding PLRs, we plan to move forward with our plans to convert. The REIT structure does not impact our strategy or execution plan. It simply enhances returns. Our strategy is focused on sustaining the durability of the business, maximizing free cash flow and supporting attractive stockholder returns, regardless of whether or not we ultimately convert to a REIT. Our free cash flow before discretionary investments, which we define as M&A, real estate, emerging businesses and dividends, is roughly USD 300 million to USD 340 million, based on our anticipated CapEx included in 2014 guidance, which includes about USD 50 million of CapEx related to acquisition integration and consolidation of facilities in Latin America in order to drive additional synergies. With regard to discretionary spending, we have a pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities, as demonstrated by our recent transactions in both mature and emerging markets. Generally, these transactions are accretive fairly quickly due to our ability to integrate them into our existing infrastructure and consolidate facilities. We also have opportunities to invest in emerging businesses, similar to the way we are growing our data center business. As always, all our investments are made through a clear capital allocation approach to deliver long-term sustainable returns to shareholders. With respect to new adjacent businesses, we will start small with some interesting new opportunities, assess them, and either scale them or scrap them. Further, to our capital allocation approach, we know some of you have questions about what our dividend level and/or share repurchase program might look as a C-Corp. I would just like to reiterate that we are committed to enhancing shareholder payouts and will strive for a dividend level and/or share repurchases that allow for consistent growth over the long term, in line with growth in the free cash flow of the business, whilst allowing the flexibility to pursue high-return investments that support growth. Again, Brian will have more details, but with regard to our preliminary view on 2014, we are projecting solid constant dollar revenue growth of 2% to 4% and constant dollar adjusted OIBDA growth of 2% to 5%, consistent with the long-term goals we've referenced to in the past. Our guidance incorporates any efficiency benefits from our organizational realignment. As I noted earlier, some of this will help offset pressure from expected continued declines in core service activity, while some will be reinvested to advance our strategy, which we believe yield attractive returns in excess of our hurdle rates. Moreover, in the future, you can expect that we will engage in the organization a continuous improvement approach focused on enhancing profitability to offset headwinds in the service side of the business, provide for some profit growth and provide resources for investment in future growth. Before I turn over the call, I want to sincerely thank Brian for his contributions as CFO over the last 6.5 years. He's added a great deal of value for both the company and our investors, and he will be missed. Brian is not just a great professional, but he's been a great colleague, and I am truly thankful for his help with my transition over the past year. Brian is moving to a new opportunity at the beginning of next year and we wish him all the best. He'll be working with us through the end of the year to transition the role. I wish also to introduce Rod Day, currently CFO of International, who has been with us for 5 years. Rod is very knowledgeable about our operations and emerging market strategy. He was instrumental in driving the 700 basis points of profit improvement achieved in our International business over a 3-year period, and achieving this against a backdrop where he helped add a number of new emerging markets to the portfolio. He's been a good steward of capital, having allocated resources amongst numerous international markets whilst deploying more than USD 0.5 billion for acquisitions and capital expenditures during that same period. He has also been involved from the start with the changes we need to make our International business, to ensure compliance with REIT tests. We'll be in good hands with Rod as the acting CFO of the enterprise while we consider both internal and external candidates. In summary, we had a solid quarter punctuated by several major accomplishments related to the execution of our plan and further progress towards REIT preparedness, including alignment of our capital structure. We are making some changes to the organization to support our strategy and speed of execution. And we believe our plan sets us up well to sustain the durability of the business and support long-term growth. Additionally, our outlook for 2014 is solid and in line with our expectations for the business. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian.
Brian P. McKeon: Thanks, Bill. Given that we've got a lot to cover today, including our preliminary outlook for 2014, we moved a few of our regular year-to-date slides to the appendix for your reference. Let's turn now to Slide 3, which highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered solid results in Q3, reflecting strong operating performance supported by consistent storage rental growth, International profit gains, as well as benefits from recent acquisitions. Storage rental grew 4% on a constant dollar basis in the quarter, supported by consistent 2% gains in North America and 10% growth in International, including benefits from recent acquisitions in Latin America and North America. Adjusted OIBDA performance was in line with expectations in Q3, driven by continued International margin gains and sustained cost controls. As we deliver solid operating performance, we continue to advance our strategic plan, supported by core acquisitions and investments in our data center offerings and capabilities. These investments are intended to sustain the durability of our core business and provide a platform for future revenue and profit growth. For the full year 2013, the core business is on track to achieve its financial goals. Today, we're updating our 2013 outlook to reflect recently completed acquisitions, including Cornerstone, and the impact of the restructuring charges of about $30 million we expect to record in 2013. Looking ahead to 2014, we expect constant dollar growth of 2% to 4% in revenues and 2% to 5% in adjusted OIBDA, supported by continued strong operating performance and the benefits of our 2013 acquisitions. Although we continue to pursue REIT conversion effective January 1, 2014, our preliminary 2014 outlook assumes C-Corp reporting. Let's move on to Slide 4 to review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the third quarter of 2012. Q3 results were in line with our expectations and consistent with recent trends. Enterprise revenues grew 2.2% on a constant dollar basis, as our International segment continued to produce strong results. International posted 7% constant dollar revenue growth, supported by 10% storage rental growth, including benefits from our recent acquisitions in Colombia and Peru. North America posted flat constant dollar revenue growth as 2% storage rental gains were offset by lower complementary service revenues. FX rate changes reduced revenue growth by approximately 130 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted OIBDA was $240 million, up 0.4%, excluding the $5 million restructuring charge. A key driver of profit performance was the continued improvement in our International segment, consistent with our plans. International adjusted OIBDA increased 18% year-on-year in Q3, reflecting strong top line growth and continued margin gains. Year-to-date, our International adjusted OIBDA margin is 25%, in line with our 3-year improvement plan to increase International margins by 700 basis points. We expect the underlying margin to exceed 25% for the full year, though the reported numbers will be slightly lower due to the impacts of recently completed acquisitions and related integration costs. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.31 per share, compared to $0.34 in Q3 2012. The year-on-year decrease was due primarily to 19 million additional shares outstanding, including those issued as part of our special dividend last November. Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS exclude the impact of costs associated with the REIT conversion, which reduced reported EPS by $0.08 per share net of tax. GAAP earnings per share of $0.03 included $21 million of REIT cost and $46 million of other expense, including $44 million of early debt extinguishment charges in connection with our Q3 refinancing activities. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 38%. Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows the components building to our overall revenue growth. Q3 growth rates showed some improvement compared to last quarter and were in line with our full year outlook. For the quarter, consistent storage rental growth of 3.6% on a constant dollar basis drove overall revenue performance. Year-on-year global net volume growth was 3.2%, including a 2.2% benefit from our 2013 acquisitions. North America posted 1.6% constant dollar storage rental growth, reflecting relatively flat records management volume, pricing of 1.3% and the benefits from our recent acquisitions. North American pricing gains were consistent in Q2 (sic) [Q3] reflecting impacts from prior year comparisons. For the full year, we expect pricing gains to be approximately 1.5%. International storage rental growth was 9.5% in constant dollar for the quarter, reflecting 24% growth in emerging markets, supported by strong organic gains and benefits from acquisitions. Internal storage rental growth remained strong in International, with a 6.5% gain in the quarter. For the year, we expect overall storage rental growth to grow about 4% on a constant dollar basis. Total services were flat on a constant dollar basis in Q3, as International service growth, supported by acquisitions, was offset by North American service declines driven by lower complementary service revenues. Higher incoming volumes and related transportation revenues helped to offset these impacts in the quarter. Average paper prices declined 19% year-on-year, resulting in $3 million less revenue in Q3, compared to the last year. At current paper prices levels, which are down about 15% versus the 2012 average, we will see some pressure on this front moving forward, which will constrain overall service gains. Overall, total internal growth was 1%, as 2.3% gains in storage rental more than offset modest service declines. Let's move now to Slide 6 and review our 2013 acquisitions in more detail. As you know, acquisitions are an important tool we use to execute key components of our stated business strategy to drive continued profitable growth in our mature markets and to further penetrate attractive emerging markets. To date in 2013, we've completed 6 core acquisitions for a total consideration of approximately $320 million. This includes our most recent acquisition of Cornerstone Records Management here in the U.S. for approximately $190 million. Excluding Cornerstone, which was a unique opportunity, we spent approximately $130 million on core acquisitions so far this year. This aligns with our projected average annual deployment of $50 million to $150 million presented at Investor Day last October. In the mature markets, the goal is to optimize the storage network we've built through fold-in acquisitions and extend the durability of these high-return businesses. Although Cornerstone is certainly larger than the typical business we're likely to acquire, the fold-in economics of this transaction are attractive and will support future revenue and profit growth. Post acquisition, we generally realize the benefits of operating efficiencies within the first year or so. Benefits derived from rationalizing the real estate portfolio in an acquisition may take up to several years, depending on the size of the business, lease expiration dates and the volume that needs to be moved. All of this is factored into our valuation models as we make our investment decisions. We continue to acquire businesses in high-growth emerging markets to build market leadership and position ourselves to capture the first-time outsourcing wave taking place in these countries. In June, we acquired Archivum in Brazil, building on last year's acquisition of Grupo Store. In September, we acquired File Service, the leading records management company in Peru, and entered a new market with the acquisition of the records management division of G4S in Colombia. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we'll continue to evaluate these opportunities through a disciplined capital allocation and ROIC lens, ensuring we create value for our shareholders. Let's now turn to Slide 7 to look at our balance sheet metrics. As previously announced, we completed several financing transactions that sustained our sound balance sheet. First, we amended our senior credit facility, upsizing it to $1.5 billion with a syndicate of 21 banks. The new facility is composed entirely of a revolving credit facility with no term loans. Pricing under the credit facility didn't change as a result of this amendment and is based on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin, which varies based on certain financial ratios. We also took advantage of attractive market opportunities to lower the cost of our fixed debt and extend maturities by issuing $600 million of 6% senior notes due 2023 in the U.S. and $20 million of 6 1/8% senior Canadian dollar notes due in 2021. The net proceeds of these transactions were used to redeem all our 8% senior subordinated notes due 2018 and 2020, to redeem our outstanding 7 1/2% Canadian dollar senior sub notes due in 2017 and to fund a cash tender for $138 million of our 8 3/8% senior sub notes due in 2021. Through the amendment to our credit agreement, we changed our consolidated leverage ratio for compliance purposes to a lease-adjusted consolidated leverage ratio, which is an EBITDAR-based calculation that adds leases to our total debt. This better aligns with how rating agencies view our leverage and recognizes that leases are a form of financing. At the end of Q3, that ratio was 4.9x, with a requirement not to exceed 6.5x. This compares to 4.2x calculated under the prior credit agreement, which excluded the impact of leases from the calculation and had a requirement not to exceed 5.5x. To align with this new calculation, we're establishing a target lease-adjusted consolidated leverage range of 4 to 5x. This equates to our previous range of 3 to 4x excluding lease financing. As I just indicated, we're currently operating with a net total lease-adjusted leverage ratio of 4.9x, which is just below the high end of our targeted 4 to 5x range. Our leverage ratio has increased over the past 2-plus years as planned, to support shareholder payouts of $1.7 billion, expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT and recent acquisitions. The costs associated with REIT conversion, including tax payments, will temporarily push our leverage to or just above the high end of our range. We're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was more than $1.1 billion, with $172 million in cash and $975 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our strong cash flows support continued advancement of our capital allocation strategy and our REIT conversion. Year-to-date, we paid $155 million in cash dividends and $130 million of REIT costs, including REIT-related CapEx and tax payments related to depreciation recapture. We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy, while advancing substantial payouts to shareholders and we remain well positioned to fund our business plan. That concludes a review of the Q3 2013 results. Let's now turn to Slide 8 to review our 2014 outlook -- or excuse me, our 2013 outlook. Slide 8 summarizes our updated 2013 operating outlook. As I mentioned earlier, our business trends and operating fundamentals are consistent and we're on track to achieve our financial goals for 2013. Today, we're upgrading our full year 2013 guidance to reflect recently completed acquisitions, including Cornerstone, and the $30 million of restructuring charges Bill discussed in his comments. For ease of discussion, we're presenting our updated outlook for the underlying business excluding the $30 million of restructuring charges separately, and then layering in the charges to show their impact on our expected reported results. We're now expecting full year revenues to be between $3,025,000,000 and $3,050,000,000 and adjusted OIBDA ex restructuring to be between $905 million and $925 million. Our expectations for adjusted EPS, CapEx and free cash flow remain basically the same as last quarter, with the exception of $5 million of data center spending that will now take place in 2014. The impact of the restructuring charge will be to reduce adjusted OIBDA by $30 million, adjust EPS by $0.10 per share and free cash flow by $18 million. As we've been highlighting, we anticipate significant one-time operating capital costs associated with our potential conversion to a REIT. These costs relate to system investments, legal and tax work, advisory fees and other miscellaneous costs to implement the proposed structure. We're investing to ensure that we meet the January 1, 2014 deadline and several of our REIT-critical systems are now operating on a test basis. For the year, we expect to incur between $65 million and $95 million of incremental expense. The impact of these costs will be a reduction in reported EPS of $0.26 to $0.36. These costs are tracking consistently with previously disclosed estimates of total conversion costs. Slides laying out our outlook for line items below adjusted OIBDA, as well as the REIT-related items, are included in the appendix. Let's move now to Slide 9 to begin our review of the preliminary 2014 outlook. Slide 9 highlights key factors supporting our preliminary outlook for 2014 performance. First, let me remind you that we continue to -- although we continue to pursue REIT conversion, our preliminary 2014 outlook assumes C-Corp reporting. As such, there are approximately $10 million to $15 million of ongoing REIT compliance costs that are not included in our operating forecast for 2014. These costs are currently being categorized as REIT costs and being reported separately. If and when we successfully convert to a REIT, we'll update our guidance accordingly. As noted earlier, our outlook is for 2% to 4% constant dollar revenue growth and 2% to 5% constant dollar adjusted OIBDA growth in 2014, supported by sustained performance in North America, solid revenue profit growth in our International segment and benefits from our 2013 acquisitions. We expect to realize $30 million to $40 million in annual cost savings from our restructuring plan. These savings will offset cost inflation and pressure from continuing service activity declines and fund investments to support our growth strategy. Our International business, excluding the impact of acquisitions and their related integration costs, will continue to accrete margin of about 50 basis points next year, building on the 700 basis point improvement we achieved over the last 3 years. Assuming FX rates remain at recent levels, foreign exchange will not have a material impact on our reported growth rates in 2014. The 6 core acquisitions completed to date in 2013 will build on sustained operating performance and set a solid foundation for future revenue and profit growth, consistent with our long-term strategy. Overall, we expect these completed transactions to add 2.5 percentage points to our constant dollar revenue growth in 2014, along with $20 million to $25 million of incremental adjusted OIBDA after initial integration costs. Additional efficiency and operating gains will be realized over time as our real estate consolidation plans are implemented for these businesses. Our CapEx and free cash flow will be impacted by our recent acquisitions and investments in our data centers. We targeted nearly $40 million of CapEx for acquisitions, primarily Cornerstone, and about $10 million to support real estate consolidations, especially in Brazil and Argentina. These investments will drive future profit growth. We also expect to about -- to invest about $40 million in data center build-outs, including our first aboveground facility in Massachusetts. Let's turn to Slide 10 to summarize our 2014 outlook. Again, on a constant dollar basis, we're targeting 2% to 4% revenue growth and 2% to 5% adjusted OIBDA growth. On a reported basis, this outlook supports our preliminary revenue guidance of between $3,090,000,000 and $3,170,000,000 and adjusted OIBDA of $930 million to $960 million. Our outlook for adjusted EPS is to remain in the range of $1.03 to $1.14 per share, as adjusted OIBDA gains are offset by higher depreciation and amortization and increased interest expense. Our adjusted EPS calculation assumes 193 million shares outstanding and a structural tax rate of $39 million -- of 39%. Our outlook is for consistent underlying free cash flow to reflect solid operating performance and consistent trends. The year-on-year decrease in expected free cash flow is primarily due to higher capital expenditures of $245 million for the year, driven by approximately $50 million in acquisition integration and real estate consolidations designed to drive future profit gains. This outlook for 2014 is preliminary and is based on current FX rates, paper prices and shares outstanding, any or all of which can change materially in short periods of time. We'll update our outlook again on our Q4 earnings call to reflect changes, if any, in these variables. A slide laying out our outlook for line items below adjusted OIBDA is included in the appendix. That concludes our review. In summary, Q3 was a quarter of solid financial performance, and we're on track to achieve our 2013 financial goals. We continue to execute against our business plan, sustaining high profits and cash flow in North America and driving strong growth and higher returns in our International business. We continue to advance work in connection with the REIT conversion as part of our long-term approach to enhance value creation for stockholders. Thank you, and we'd now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from George Tong of Piper Jaffray.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: I want to get a sense for what your outlook is for organic storage volume trends in North America. How much has your sales force verticalization and sales and marketing investments contributed to capping the un-vended storage opportunity?
William L. Meaney: George, it's Bill. I think right now we're still seeing continued traction on the verticalization, but again, as I said last time, it's still early days because we stood up a number of the verticals. I think right now, in terms of volume growth, is we're flat, trying to trend upward in some of the markets that we've applied it to. But I think in terms of revenue, we're still seeing the 1%, 1.5% revenue growth, if we look at the North American business.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Got it. And within International storage, can you talk about whether you're maintaining share in the countries where you have a leadership position and what your progress is in taking non-leadership countries to leadership positions?
William L. Meaney: Well, I think on that, we're actually gaining share in the markets where we have leadership positions and we're, in some countries where we've been at it longer than others, in spots in South America, for instance, we're mimicking margins that we see in North America, in the most mature markets. So that's progressing very well. I think that the -- overall, I think if you look at the countries, Peru, we did an acquisition which puts us into a strong leadership position now in Peru this year. Last year, through our acquisitions in Brazil, we achieved a market position, but we've done now an even more recent acquisition in Brazil, which furthers the distance between ourselves and our next competitor. So I think with the targeted acquisitions we've done is we've continued to build market-leading positions. So if we kind of look at in Latin America right now, in Chile, Brazil, Peru and Colombia, because the acquisition we did in Colombia was already in a leading or pole position in that market, we have clear market-leading positions in all those countries.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: That's helpful. And can you talk a bit about the progress you're making and additional color in scaling your wholesale data center business and any other diversifying growth initiatives you have beyond wholesale data centers?
William L. Meaney: It's too early for us to comment on it. We have a pipeline in the emerging business, which Harry is now taking over. And there's a number of things that are building up in that pipeline, and we're screening those to figure out which ones will go to the testing phase. And as I said, we'll test, and then based on those tests, we'll either drop or we'll scale. So we're in the process of that. In terms of the wholesale data center space, we are making some real progress. And in fact, we're starting to see more and more synergies between the wholesale data space and our data protection business, because many customers like the continuity in terms of what we can do for them vis-à-vis their tiered archiving strategy, so it's more of a continuous product. So again, early days, but that's why we were encouraged to go ahead to start the construction of the aboveground facility in Northborough, Massachusetts.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: And then last question, excluding special charges this quarter, OIBDA was -- margins were flat from the prior year. What are the drivers for continued margin upside? Any specifics you have, especially on the International front?
William L. Meaney: I think on the International front, I think Brian highlighted, and he can go into more specifics, is a modest gain. But I think again, I think I said this last time on the call, you need to think about International as a portfolio play. And that's why I highlighted in my remarks that Rod, with his leadership in International, achieved 700 basis points whilst adding a number of emerging markets. Because when we buy these emerging market plays, it takes us a while to get them to the margins that we get as we fold in and rationalize the real estate. And so our view is that if you start seeing a major ramp-up in the overall International margin, it's saying that we're not finding places that are good opportunities to start building market-leading positions in other geographies. So next year, I think Brian highlighted it, it's a fairly modest improvement in terms of our OIBDA margin on International. It's not saying that the business isn't growing in value. It's just saying that we see an acquisition pipeline, which it takes time to actually bring those things up, both to a market-leading position, and to actually consolidate the operations so that we start mimicking the margins. So we have countries in South America that, as I say, are at the same or actually even slightly higher margin than the United States. And we have others that are further back on the development curve that are growing. So it is really a portfolio play.
Brian P. McKeon: Yes, that's exactly right. I think in North America, we're trying to sustain very high returns, where we have, in 2/3 of our portfolio internationally, where we have leadership and very good returns, we're trying to sustain those as well and drive additional margin improvement overall as we continue to scale out the International portfolio and control our overhead costs in corporate and drive efficiencies that enable us to reinvest selectively against new growth opportunities. So in balance, right now, we're in a zone where our profit is projected to grow at or slightly above our revenue growth rate. And I think over time, as we continue to be successful advancing growth opportunities, I think that will give us greater chance to kind of leverage our cost base and produce some margin gains.
William L. Meaney: Yes. And one thing on that, just to add to Brian's comment, is the thing you should keep in mind, that we're always doing these things above our hurdle rate. So yes, we want to actually make even higher returns on equity, but these acquisitions that we're doing in these emerging markets typically are plus-20% return on equity and have very attractive, obviously then, returns on invested capital. But as they grow, then of course, the returns grow even more.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Bill, I want ask you a little more about Cornerstone. The acquisition, is this, would you say, more of a real estate consolidation play? Or is this more of a play where you have a much better entree into this mid-market, where you guys typically haven't played that much?
William L. Meaney: Good question, Shlomo. It's both. I think that, first of all, to your first question on the real estate side, the reason why the returns look so attractive, as we say, it's mid-teens in terms of return on equity and 10%-plus return on invested capital, is going to your real estate question. It's almost like a pickup and move because there's such an overlap in terms of their real estate and ours. So it takes a little while because I think some of the leases go out to 5 years, where we won't be able to consolidate the real estate overnight. But we're going to be able to consolidate a lot of it fairly quickly. So it is, to your point, a real estate operations consolidation move, is what's in our acquisition model driving the value, first and foremost. So that's what we based our modeling on and that's what we're banking the returns on. So it's something that we're very comfortable with. I think the potential upside to outperform, that's very difficult to quantify. Is your comment about their presence on the middle market? In some of the organizational changes I alluded to is also helping us get at that. So we are looking to get some D&A from Cornerstone and doing -- being more aggressive in the middle market, where we may not have been as present in the past. And we think there's some interesting opportunities there.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Do you think you're going to need to stand up a separate sales organization? Because I mean, typically the typical account that they went after has really, has a different parameter than the kind of national or even international accounts that you typically go after.
William L. Meaney: Shlomo, I'd rather get into that on Investor Day in March because -- I'm not trying to be coy, but the announcement that we've made in terms of the reorganization of the alignment and restructuring that we're taking is going -- part of that is addressing your question. And as you can probably appreciate, we're in the process of communicating that throughout the organization. So I don't want to really get ahead of myself in terms of our announcements internally. But part of our restructuring is to actually address the question that you're asking.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. I'll move on from there. I appreciate that. The core service decline was kind of the lowest we've seen since 1Q '12. Just from what you guys talked about in terms of expectation that service to continue to weigh, do I assume that you guys view this as an anomaly as opposed to a bottoming?
Brian P. McKeon: I think there are similarities in the trend, Shlomo. We are seeing benefit as we're acquiring businesses and integrating them. The related transportation activity and things of that nature, there's a benefit that flows through core service. We are seeing some leveling of the service trends. I don't want to make too much of that at this stage, but I think some of the flattening we're beginning to see, it's still down, and we're still anticipating a level of pressure there. And we also just have some more favorable compares year-on-year. We worked through some of the tougher comparison areas, like our Shredding business in International. So on balance, it's somewhat better and we've got some discrete things that are helping us, but I would reinforce, we still expect to have a level of pressure on just the really, the key impact of technology, which is not on our storage business, but more on how paper records are used in business operations. We do anticipate some level of pressure going forward.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And then Brian, maybe you could just walk us through the difference between the OIBDA and the free cash flow this year and the OIBDA and the free cash flow of next year. I mean, how much of it is the difference of interest expense? And how much of it are relating to some of the other efforts that you guys have, maybe in data center and some of the other things?
Brian P. McKeon: It's principally capital. So if you took our numbers next year, Shlomo, we try to highlight that there's roughly $50 million of investment in integrating the acquisitions, as well as including some discrete investments we're making in Latin America to capture -- to get more efficient real estate operations. If you adjust it for that $50 million number, I think you basically see very similar trends year-on-year in adjusted OIBDA. We'll have somewhat -- we have low cash taxes this year, driven by the timing of some payments. But next year, that will be more normalized as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I'm sorry, I can't resist. I'm going to ask another core service question, if that's okay. So in the quarter, there's language in the press release that says new incoming volume related to transportation. So could you just be specific? You definitely have been very clear that there's a long-term trend to less retrievals, but in the third quarter, was there some recovery in that retrieval piece? And then looking at 2014, do you feel like core service internally could be flattish?
Brian P. McKeon: Andrew, it's add lots [ph] is where we're seeing some benefit. There is some acquisition benefit as well. But the add lots [ph], it's an area of focus in terms of selling force effectiveness, growth in international markets. We're seeing -- we saw better trends on add lots [ph] or new incoming volume in Q3. And I think your outlook overall next year for services is in the ballpark. Kind of, I think overall, our underlying growth on an internal basis, we're looking at 2% to 3% storage and relatively flat service numbers. And obviously, paper and things like that will have some impact on that. But given our current view, that those are reasonable estimates.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And that flattish comment about service for 2014 was an internal comment, right?
Brian P. McKeon: That was internal, that's right. So there's about 2.5% benefit overall from the acquisitions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann of Baird.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Wanted to ask first on kind of the data center strategy, Bill, and maybe Brian as well. Just kind of, can you help us phase in what you think kind of what a reasonable capital outlay for that business is? And then more strategically, can you just talk about how, as kind of a real estate play here, Iron Mountain is going to differentiate in the marketplace versus some, already some pretty good competitors? And then maybe lastly, if you haven't already, can you comment on if this data center that you're currently starting construction on is spec or if it already has some tenants?
William L. Meaney: I think, first of all, this is -- the reason why we have an emerging business, this is a step-by-step approach, as we said it is. We invest capital based on where we see that this potential demand is the way to test it out. So right now, our plan is the $40 million that we've discussed, that we've earmarked, which is both expanding our operation in Boyers in the underground facility, as well as building the aboveground facility at our campus in Northborough, Massachusetts. I think that the other part of your question is how do we compete against the other players in this space, is the feedback -- and I was actually with a customer last week, the feedback we're getting is that because of our strong customer relationships on the data protection side and our understanding in terms of what CIOs and data center infrastructure people understand what their business is about, is that they're very comfortable talking to us, especially when they start thinking about their archiving strategy in a more continuous method. So what we're finding is that we actually do have a differentiated brand. And in fact, we've hired a couple of people who used to be in what are competitors to us today. So early days still, but we felt confident, enough based on the lead generation and customers that we're starting to sign up, that this was, is definitely a business that we should pay attention to and continue to test and develop. So I think right now, I think that's where we are. I think in terms of customers signed up, as you probably can appreciate it, is that it's chicken and egg. In other words, to sign somebody into a colo or a wholesale data center contract, and the Northborough facility is more about colocation, is that the facility has to be done or nearly done. But we didn't break ground until we had a robust enough pipeline of leads that we felt comfortable that this was a very low-risk opportunity to, or a low-risk investment in terms of to start the construction. And at this point, we haven't signed anyone for the Northborough facility, but we have a strong pipeline that we feel pretty comfortable with that we'll be able to get traction relatively soon when the facility is completed.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Got you. That's helpful. And then I wanted to just dig in on some of your comments. You kind of mentioned that there are several PLRs with the IRS. As we look at the 8-K from the summer, it really seemed like that the racking was the one that was specifically called out there as kind of the main issue. Not looking for any insight as to where we are in the process, but just to understand the scope and the number of issues in front of the IRS, should investors be thinking about that summer 8-K on racking as really the kind of the crux of the issue? Or are there other, in these several PLRs that are out there, that also we should be thinking about or contemplating as we think about the company here today?
Brian P. McKeon: So Andrew, there are a range of topics that we sought clarity from the IRS in terms of REIT conversion. Just going back to what we said in the past, there are, in our lens, a few key issues. Racking is one of them. Goodwill is another topic. There's some specifics related to our business model on how we store items that results to something that we wanted to clarify. The issue of racking was specifically what the IRS had highlighted when they informed us about the formation of the working group and the delay in the process. And so that was the issue that they were centered on, related to whatever it is they're sorting out through the working group. There are other topics that we need to clarify. And consistent with what we've said all along, going back in time, and as we've said, we feel good about our arguments. And it's not certain, the outcomes are uncertain here, but we feel good about our arguments and positioning, and we'll continue to work to be ready to become a REIT, assuming we can get favorable clarification on that over time.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. So is it fair to say that just because these other issues weren't mentioned in the 8-K that you filed this summer that, that does not necessarily mean that they're fully addressed or signed off on by the IRS?
Brian P. McKeon: Trying to answer that question, though -- we haven't referred to getting clarity on other issues with the IRS.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Bill, in terms of the search, what are you looking for in terms of CFO? And as you think about that, just any characteristics you're looking for. I mean, Brian has obviously done a wonderful job operationally. What are you focused on as you think about the next candidate in that seat?
William L. Meaney: Look, I think you can have a long list and it can be trying to identify purple squirrels, so to speak. I think that we feel pretty good that we have strong internal candidates. But it's like any of these situations, you need to go outside and look at the benchmarks. And we will look across both the REIT and non-REIT world. It's going to be important whoever is the CFO going forward has a strong operating bend as well as a good financial bend because we do have a fairly -- I wouldn't say complex business, but we have a lot of moving pieces and it's a very global business. So we think we have both strong internal candidates, but we also think it's important to benchmark those people against what the market also has available to us. So we'll see how we progress. But one other thing that I highlighted on the call, about Harry's move with JT coming in his place, Brian's moving out and Rod is coming in, it is a company that we take seriously succession planning and building bench strength. So we feel like we're in good shape. But at the same time, I think for good diligence, we should go out and see what the market has.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Got it. And then, kind of any sense on timing -- I know, when kind of Brian came in, John had transitioned before Brian came in. Any sense of timing on when we should expect an announcement?
William L. Meaney: No. I think we're in the process of appointing a headhunter to assist us with it, and we're going to go through as fast and deliberate as we can, but I don't think that we can be pinned down to a timing at this point.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Got it. And then just shifting gears, looking at kind of the storage internal growth. I mean, it looks like we're seeing a pretty consistent trend in terms of a slower rate of destruction, and obviously, the storage overall benefiting. That seems pretty consistent with past recoveries. As you think about the reacceleration and the internal growth in the core storage business, is this tracking pretty similar to past recoveries? And should we expect more organic sales as kind of -- overall, I know it's always a function of -- there's a macro component to it. But any kind of flavor on that as well?
William L. Meaney: Kevin, I think that I wouldn't, because I think that -- look, especially given a lot of the -- there's been a lot of legal holds recently as well. And some of it is just driven by legal holds. And as those cases get cleared, you can get some lumpiness in terms of the destruction. So I wouldn't, at this point, read too much into those trends. I think where some of the things that we're highlighting, which I discussed in an earlier question, about how we're making some realignments and adjustments in our go-to-market, that we think that we're going to get a better response and share of, say, the middle market, I think, is where the benefit is going to come from. At this point, I wouldn't start reading too much into trends around destruction. I think where our attention is focusing on much more improving the inbounding rather than thinking that we have a lot of control or see a different trend on the destruction side.
Brian P. McKeon: I would say I think the trends reinforce the durability of this business, and we're doing quite well in a slower-growth global economy, and I think have opportunities to build on that operationally. And if there's improvement in the macro economy, that can help us as well over time.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Great, and then just if I could, what percentage of the business now is kind of middle market versus larger enterprise, on the storage side?
Brian P. McKeon: Roughly half of our business is customers, larger customers with multiyear agreements, and roughly half are customers that are relatively smaller, that are on annual agreements, and that's in terms of revenue, not in terms of number of customers. Obviously, they'd be more smaller. But I think that the opportunity here is to not just increase the focus on the relatively small customers, but also to extend our reach a bit here and really fully develop that opportunity. And in terms of the un-vended opportunity, I think there's a lot of indications that there's still substantial potential there. So we have a good established base, but I think it's something that the company can build on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: On the lines of the services, Brian, you answered Andrew earlier on, I believe it was core service as kind of an outlook for next year. And I just want to confirm that was core as opposed to overall service, because I noticed in the press release, complementary services decreased due to delayed timing in some document management services and special projects. And the second part of this question is, are you seeing a buildup now of special project activity and it's just delayed? Or is that a more broad, longer-term statement?
Brian P. McKeon: The special project was just a very specific reference to the quarter, just kind of near-term activity, just trying to highlight some of the drivers. And the reference was to core service. Overall service probably is going to be flattish as well, just because we do anticipate some pressure from -- given where paper prices are currently, offsetting some of the gains that we're making on other fronts. But I think overall, a relatively flattish core service outlook before acquisitions and internal growth of 2% to 3% storage.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then my last question will be with regard to acquisitions, you guys mentioned, somewhere in the prepared remarks, that the kind of the long-term guidance for acquisitions was somewhere, domestic and emerging, $50 million to $150 million, and kind of near the high end of range of that, without even bringing Cornerstone into the mix. So I just want to get an update on how you're thinking about that longer term. Is there going to be a pause? Or is it a bit of a pedal to the metal from here?
William L. Meaney: Scott, I think that we have -- if we look at International, we've got a pretty strong pipeline, so I don't see much pausing, because we've got them queued up, to a certain degree. But it's opportunistic. We don't chase deals and we don't chase markets. But we are constantly scanning the horizon, and we see, especially in the International side, some good opportunities. We see some possible good bolt-ins in some of our core markets to keep those strong and healthy, and our cash flow going forward. But it's also opportunistic. We don't control the timing on these things. But we feel pretty good, for instance, with the International pipeline. I think we probably have to kind of close it and wrap it up then, if it's okay. We're a little bit over time. So I want to thank you, operator. And to wrap it up, just to emphasize, we had a good quarter, driven by consistent growth in our storage rental business and we made good progress on all 3 key pillars of our strategy, which is sustaining growth in the mature markets, growing our presence in the emerging markets and evaluating, incubating and scaling new emerging businesses. Our financial position continues to be strong and we feel good about the opportunities to grow the business at attractive returns on capital, based on what we see going forward. We've enhanced our focus on the key drivers of value for the business and are starting to realign the organization for maximum efficiency and to go after those opportunities. As we implement our plan, we will always continue to focus on improving capital allocation, maximizing the total returns and delivering a sustainable value to our shareholders. So I want to thank you all for joining us this morning, and let's hope the Sox keep it up.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-08-01 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Melissa Marsden William L. Meaney - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Executive Vice President
Analysts: George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division Andrew Berg - Post Advisory Group, LLC
Operator: Good morning. My name is Lashanda, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q2 2013 Earnings Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn today's call over to Ms. Melissa Marsden. Ms. Marsden, you may begin your conference.
Melissa Marsden: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. And this morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights and strategic initiatives; followed by Brian McKeon, our CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. Stephen Golden, VP, IR, is also with us today. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation available at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2013 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, can be found at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill Meaney.
William L. Meaney: Thank you, Melissa, and many -- and my thanks to everyone joining us today, and good morning. Our second quarter results reflect our focus on sustaining the durability of the business in supporting our future growth. Total revenues were $755 million, adjusted OIBDA was $233 million and adjusted earnings per share was $0.29 per share. These amounts include a $5 million legal accrual noted in our press release. Prior to this accrual, our financial performance was in line with our expectations for both the quarter and the year-to-date. Operating performance is also tracking in line with our expectations, with consistent storage rental constant dollar growth of 3% and storage rental internal growth of 2.3% for the quarter. As we've indicated in recent quarters, the trend towards lower levels of retrieval and refile activity and related transportation services in developed markets continues. But also as expected, service declines moderated somewhat during the second quarter, and our solid storage rental revenue growth continued to offset service declines and support our consistent profit results. Overall, our full year outlook for operating performance remains the same, aside from the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Before Brian reviews our financial performance, I'd like to discuss our initiatives to continue to support the durability of our core business and the growth opportunities we're seeing in both our developed and emerging markets and progress on our plans to convert to a REIT. As a reminder, when I refer to developed markets for Iron Mountain, that includes not only our North American markets of Canada and the United States, but Australia and the U.K. as well. It also includes Western Europe, where our team continues to deliver solid results, with good volume growth and improved profitability. This is despite a lackluster macroeconomic environment across Europe. As I mentioned last quarter, our strategy to sustain the durability of the business in our developed markets includes 3 elements. One, tailoring our sales and marketing efforts to focus on vertical markets and add value for customers through industry-specific solutions. Two is differentiating our core storage and service offerings with innovative tools that drive incremental storage from existing customers, as well as attracting new customers. And three, acquisition opportunities driven by ongoing consolidation in our industry. With respect to the first of these elements, we've worked through the realignment of our sales and marketing organizations to focus on verticals. This transition has taken some time to implement, but we're beginning to see results. For example, our focus on the health care market in North America is driving storage rental in this vertical, offsetting declines in query-driven service activity. We continue to see this dynamic in the second quarter, with health care storage rental up roughly 3% year-to-date versus last year. Being aligned along vertical markets also is permitting us to extend our reach into related segments such as life sciences. While our foray into this segment is more recent, we are seeing good interest from both new and existing customers, driving increases in project-related complementary services, as well as about a 3.5% increase in storage rental year-to-date. We also have seen a nice pickup in new business bookings in this vertical segment, although the related volume will not be reflected in this year's results. Overall, we continue to identify ways to leverage our industry-specific expertise and bring best practices to bear. As we do this, we are having more conversations deeper within our customers' organizations in increasing the potential to drive incremental business. In addition to our vertical market approach, we are continuing to differentiate our core storage and service offerings as a means to tap the un-vended market. Consistent with this approach is our Archival Tape Management offering, which is a solution within our data protection business that helps companies manage data from legacy systems. Given the fast pace of growth in electronic data and the speed of change in technology, most companies have a tiered system of data storage. They seek to balance having the right amount of data protected in the right format, in the right place and at the right time against the cost of storing that data. Tape backup is often the second, third and even fourth line of defense and remains the most cost-effective way to move data off-site and store it for long periods of time. This service, which we just launched in April, provides quick, reliable access to archival tapes for customers even after they've shut down legacy systems. It also provides encryption of legacy data for compliance purposes and protects it from inadvertent disclosures. This data protection offering promotes discussion with customers in the un-vended space, and we're encouraged by a couple of early wins. We also continue to expand our business in developed markets through active and attractive fold-in acquisitions. Also during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of 3 records management businesses owned by Texas-based Information Storage Consolidation Company, expanding our presence in Eastern Michigan, Dallas and Southeast Florida. This acquisition adds midsized organizations to our customer roster and is consistent with our strategy for sustaining the durability of our storage business in developed markets where we continue to have a solid pipeline of active deals. We are also pursuing a number of interesting opportunities to expand our platform in high-growth emerging markets through both organic growth and accretive acquisitions that meet our financial hurdles. Customers in these markets often are just beginning to outsource their records management, and we see a significant opportunity to provide storage and related services that can help them become more efficient and reduce costs. Again, we define emerging markets to include the BRIC countries, in addition to other Latin American markets, Central and Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific markets such as Hong Kong. These emerging markets currently represent about 10% of total annual revenues, or about a $300 million business for us, and we have a number of attractive acquisitions and joint venture opportunities throughout these regions. We believe our emerging market expansion will be an engine for future growth, as demonstrated by strong storage-rental constant-dollar growth in these markets of 13% in the second quarter. As we've previously noted, achieving leadership in our international markets drives improved efficiencies similar to those in our developed markets. However, we manage our International business as a portfolio, so our ongoing acquisition activity and entry into new markets naturally tempers our ability to continue to post significant further margin improvement in the near term. That said, we are very pleased with our progress on International margin improvement goal during the quarter, achieving 24.6% for the year-to-date. This represents a 280-basis-points improvement over the first half of last year and is a significant accomplishment for our International team. In terms of business adjacencies, we are making progress with plans to accelerate the expansion of our underground wholesale data center in Pennsylvania that we talked about on our last call. We are developing our pipeline and continue to evaluate opportunities for incremental investment in this business. Finally, let me touch on the REIT. As I'm sure you are all aware, we've been advancing our preparations for conversion, including seeking Private Letter Rulings, or PLRs, from the IRS. In early June, we disclosed in an 8-K filing that we have been notified by the IRS that it had formed a working group to study the legal definition of real estate as it relates to REITs. We also said that as a result, we expected ruling from some of our PLR requests, as well as the PLR requests from other companies on similar issues, to be delayed until the IRS completes its study, which might take us beyond the approximate 1 year time line we have talked about since mid-July of last year. Obviously, we are beyond that time frame. We felt it was important to disclose the delay and also to disclose that prior to the IRS pressing the pause button, it had indicated to us that it was tentatively adverse to ruling that our racking structures are real estate for REIT purposes. We also stated that it is not unusual to receive this type of preliminary indication as part of the PLR process. We understand that the resolution of these issues is top of mind for all of you as well. However, we ask you to please understand that we are not providing any updates for you today with regard to the scope of the IRS working group study, the timing of the study, nor the tentatively adverse indication. For those of you on the call not familiar with this matter, I encourage you to refer to the 8-K filing from 6 June, which includes other details as well as risk factors. Given this lack of certainty with respect to the timing and our focus on conversion, we plan to break from tradition and will host our next investor day in March 2014, as opposed to our typical mid-October time frame. Despite this unforeseen delay, we feel good about our position with respect to our racking structures as real estate under our interpretation of the current standards, and this delay doesn't change our plans to move forward with those preparations we can control to ensure our readiness for conversion in January 2014. For example, on our targeted date of 1 July, we successfully migrated our REIT-critical IT systems and processes to a new platform that enables us to operate internally as a REIT for a period of time before we officially elect REIT status. This was a massive undertaking, and I wish to thank publicly all of our cross functional teams who were successful in meeting this tight interim deadline. These system enhancements will allow greater efficiencies and provide a robust foundation for future growth. And you may see us undertake additional steps necessary to support conversion while we await clarity on the PLR, all in the name of being prepared as we possibly can to convert in 2014. Of course, we can make no assurances we'll be successful in converting. But we believe we fit well as a REIT due to the attractive characteristics of our business, such as the quality and durability of our storage rental net operating income, our high rental revenue per square foot, the low volatility throughout economic ups and downs, the high credit quality and the high retention customer base, as well as relatively low maintenance and turnover costs. But whilst the REIT structure complements our strategy, our strategy for sustaining the durability of our business is not dependent upon the REIT. Our business generates strong, consistent cash flow in excess of what we require to invest in people, processes and platforms to support our long-term growth. Our targeted level for investment in emerging markets, acquisitions and adjacencies is approximately 25% to 35% of our free cash flow, and we believe this would be similar under our existing structure or as a REIT. It is a level that is consistent with our capital allocation approach through which we seek to maximize cash flow, and it leaves us with significant excess free cash flow to support attractive stockholder payouts. Our business is solid with great fundamentals, and we have a strategy to support growth and sustain the durability of our core storage rental business. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian to discuss our financial results in more detail.
Brian P. McKeon: Thanks, Bill. Let's turn now to Slide 3, which highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered good operating results in Q2, in line with our expectations, reflecting consistent storage rental growth and solid profit performance, supported by international margin gains. Overall, our growth trends were consistent. Storage rental grew 3% on a constant dollar basis in the quarter, supported by consistent gains in North America and 7% growth in International, including benefits from recent acquisitions in Brazil, France and North America. Durable storage gains continue to be partially offset by declines in query-based core service activity. Core service growth declines improved relative to Q1, as expected, reflecting more favorable comparisons in international markets but remain a headwind to our overall growth. Underlying adjusted OIBDA performance was solid in Q2, supported by continued international margin gains and sustained cost controls. Our Q2 and year-to-date adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS results were impacted by a legal accrual recorded in the quarter of $5 million or $0.02 per share. Excluding the legal accrual impact, adjusted OIBDA is up 1% year-to-date, in line with our full year goals. Today, we're updating our full year 2013 performance outlook to reflect changes in FX exchange rates since the beginning of the year. The strengthening of the dollar since the beginning of the year is projected to reduce full-year reported revenues between 1% and 1.5%, with relatively similar impacts in adjusted OIBDA. I'll speak more to these updates later in my remarks. Let's move on to Slide 4 to review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the second quarter of 2012. As noted, Q2 results were as expected. Enterprise revenues grew 1.3% on a constant dollar basis, as our International segment continued to produce strong revenue performance. International posted 5% constant dollar revenue growth, supported by 7% storage rental growth, including benefits from our recent acquisitions in Brazil and France. North America posted flat constant currency revenue growth, as 2% storage rental gains were offset by lower core service revenues. Foreign exchange rate changes reduced revenue growth by 0.5% in the quarter. Adjusted OIBDA was $233 million or basically flat compared to last year's Q2, excluding the $5 million legal accrual. A key driver of profit performance was the continued improvement in our International segment, consistent with our plans. International adjusted OIBDA increased 25% year-on-year in Q2, reflecting strong top line growth and continued margin gains. Savings from North America cost improvement initiatives mitigated impacts from core service revenue declines. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.29 per share compared to $0.37 in Q2 2012. Adjusting for the $0.02 per share impact of the legal accrual I described earlier, adjusted EPS would have been $0.31 per share. The year-on-year decrease was due primarily to 20 million additional shares outstanding, including those issued as part of our special dividend last November. Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS exclude the impact of costs associated with the REIT conversion, which reduced reported EPS by $0.08 per share net of tax. GAAP earnings per share of $0.14 includes $24 million of REIT costs and $15 million of other expense, partially offset by $2 million of gains on asset dispositions. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 39%. Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows the components building to our overall revenue growth. Q2 growth rates were in line with our expectations and our full year outlook. Our storage rental business remains durable, providing a solid foundation for overall revenue performance. For the quarter, consistent storage rental growth of 3% on a constant dollar basis drove overall revenue performance and supported total constant dollar revenue growth of 1.3%. Year-on-year global net volume growth was 1.4%. North America reported 1.8% constant dollar storage rental growth, reflecting relatively flat records management volume, average records management pricing gains of 1.2% and benefits from our recent acquisition. North American pricing gains were slightly lower in Q2 than recent trends, reflecting impacts from prior year comparisons. For the full year, we expect pricing gains to be approximately 1.5%. International storage rental growth of 6.6% constant dollar for the quarter reflected sustained double-digit growth in emerging markets. For the year, we expect overall storage rental to sustain consistent growth rates of about 3% on a constant dollar basis. Total services decreased 1% constant dollar as International service growth was offset by North American service revenue declines, reflecting lower activity-based core services and related transportation activity. Gains in DMS and increased project revenues in both North America and International helped to offset these impacts. Paper prices had limited impact in Q2 as lower average prices were partially offset by increased volume in North America. At current paper price levels, which are down 12% year-on-year, however, we will see some pressure on this front moving forward, which will constrain overall service gains. Overall total internal growth was 0.5%, as 2.3% gains in storage rental more than offset service pressures. Let's take a look at our segment performance on Slide 6. Slide 6 looks at our year-to-date 2013 performance compared to last year. In terms of our key financial metrics, we delivered results that reflect consistent business trends and have us on track to achieve our full year financial goals. Reported revenue of $1.5 billion was up 1% on a constant dollar basis, driven by solid storage gains. Adjusted OIBDA was flat year-over-year on a constant dollar basis. As noted earlier, excluding the $5 million legal accrual, adjusted OIBDA grew 1%, reflecting North America cost efficiencies and International margin improvement. Adjusted EPS was $0.56 per share, down 15% compared to the first half of last year, reflecting the impact of additional shares issued in connection with the special dividend last November, higher interest expense associated with shareholder payouts and the legal accrual noted earlier. These impacts more than offset lower income tax expense in the period. First half capital spending was $86 million, excluding $20 million of real estate and $14 million of REIT conversion CapEx. As a percentage of revenues, CapEx, excluding real estate and REIT CapEx, is 5.7% of sales, in line with our full year plans. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2013 was $154 million compared to $117 million for the same period last year. The year-on-year increase reflects lower cash taxes, which were partially offset by higher capital spending. The 2013 year-to-date adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS results shown here exclude $49 million of costs associated with the REIT conversion. These costs reduced reported EPS by about $0.18. Note that 2012 adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS excludes $5 million of these costs and reduces reported EPS by $0.02 per share. In addition to the $14 million of REIT-related CapEx I just discussed, we paid $28 million in taxes towards our D&A recapture liability. All told, these items would reduce free cash flow by about $76 million year-to-date. We've included a slide outlining the actual and expected REIT cost and related expenditures in the appendix of the presentation. Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review our results by segment. Slide 7 shows key year-to-date metrics for each of our 3 key segments. Consistent with our business strategy, we're sustaining high returns in our North American segment, while we continue to build our International segment as a significant driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. For the first half of 2013, our North American business segment reported revenues of $1.1 billion, supported by consistent 2% constant dollar storage rental gains. We sustained adjusted OIBDA margins of 42%, as SG&A savings offset pressures from lower service revenues. We're also sustaining capital efficiencies, with spending at 4.6% of revenues, excluding real estate. Our International segment continues to post strong constant dollar revenues, adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. Adjusted OIBDA increased 17% on a constant dollar basis, benefiting from solid global growth and cost improvement initiatives in Western European markets. International adjusted OIBDA margins have expanded 280 basis points year-to-date, keeping us on track towards our goal of about 25% International segment margins in 2013. Finally, corporate expenses were up compared to prior year levels, impacted by the $5 million legal accrual. Let's now take a look at our debt statistics on Slide 8. Solid cash flow generation enables us to maintain a sound balance sheet. We're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was nearly $800 million, with $259 million in cash and $535 million in additional borrowing capacity. We are currently operating with a consolidated leverage ratio of 4.1x, just above the high end of our targeted 3x to 4x leverage range. Our leverage ratio was increased over the past 2-plus years as planned to support shareholder payouts of $1.7 billion and expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT over that period. As we stated previously, the costs associated with REIT conversion, including tax payments, will temporarily push our leverage over the high end of our target range. Our strong cash flows support continued advancement of our capital allocation strategy and our REIT conversion. During the first half of the year, we paid $103 million in cash dividends and $90 million of REIT costs, including REIT-related CapEx and tax payments related to the depreciation recapture. As we mentioned in our recently filed 8-K, we expect to engage in some financing transactions in Q3, including amending our senior credit facility. We're currently working on that amendment and expect to complete the process shortly. The scope and timing of any additional financing activities is still to be determined, and we'll keep you abreast of these transactions as they develop. We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy, while advancing substantial payouts to shareholders, and we remain well positioned to fund our business plan. That concludes our review of the Q2 2013 results. Let's now turn to Slide 9 to review our 2013 outlook. Slide 9 summarizes our updated full year 2013 operating outlook. While our business trends and operating fundamentals are consistent, today, we're updating our full year 2013 guidance to reflect FX rate changes. Changes in FX rates since the beginning of the year are driving a projected reduction in reported revenues of more than $40 million or between 1% and 1.5% for the full year. Adjusted OIBDA will be similarly impacted on a percentage basis. We're now expecting full year revenues to be about $3,000,000,000 to $3,050,000,000 and adjusted OIBDA to be between $900 million and $925 million. We're also updating our expectations for adjusted EPS to reflect the FX changes, as well as updated estimates for interest in D&A related to recent acquisitions. We're not including any impacts from potential future refinancing activities, as the scope and timing of those transactions are not final. We'll update our outlook as appropriate on the next earnings call. As we've been highlighting, we anticipate significant onetime operating and capital costs associated with our potential conversion to a REIT. These costs relate to substantial system investments, legal and tax work, advisory fees and other costs to implement the proposed structure. We're investing to ensure that we meet the January 1, 2014 deadline, and several of our REIT-critical systems are now operating on a test basis. For the year, we expect to incur between $65 million and $95 million of incremental expense. The impact of these costs will be a reduction on reported EPS of $0.26 to $0.36 per share. Today, we're also updating our estimate for the earnings and profit distribution related -- to reflect a more detailed assessment of our International profits in countries targeted for conversion in 2014. As you know, successful conversion to a REIT requires that we distribute all of our accumulated earnings and profits related to countries converted to shareholders by the end of our first year as a REIT. Based on updated information and additional analysis, we now expect our total distribution to be between $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion, of which $700 million was paid out in 2012. Slides laying out our outlook for line items below adjusted OIBDA, as well as the REIT-related items, are included in the appendix. That concludes our review. In summary, Q2 was a quarter of solid financial performance, and we're well positioned to achieve our full year financial goals. We continue to execute against our business plan, sustaining high profits and cash flow in North America and driving strong growth and higher returns in our International business. And we continue to advance work in connection with the proposed REIT conversion as part of our long-term approach to enhance value creation for stockholders. Thanks, and we'd now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Storage volumes growth this quarter, it appears decelerated from the prior several quarters. How much of this was driven by reduced growth benefits from your acquisition of Grupo Store in Brazil versus a fundamental change in volume trends that you're seeing?
Brian P. McKeon: The acquisition impact was the primary driver. We completed the Grupo Store acquisition in Q2 of last year, and so we're completing the benefit that we got from that relatively larger acquisition. The fundamental trends in the rest of the business, very similar. The -- as we noted actually, the service growth rate improved a bit on a comparable basis. We knew we had some unfavorable lapping last quarter that we worked through. And basically, our storage growth rates were consistent. I did note that the North America pricing number was a little bit lower than we've been, and that's more of a year-on-year comparison. We're expecting kind of 1.5% net pricing gains in records management in North America for the full year and for the back half.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Great. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, you're seeing improving trends in the services business. Do you expect to see services revenue declines to continue to moderate throughout the year? And any chance services growth can turn positive on a constant currency basis?
Brian P. McKeon: Yes, it's a good question. I would say the trends are similar. I think we -- it's a relatively better growth. It was down 1% constant dollar and that's more -- better than Q1, largely because Q1 had some comparison issues. We are seeing benefits from our growth in things like DMS and project-related revenue and continued expansion in the International business. We did note that the paper pricing has moved lower, so it was -- the SOP market price is now down to $138 a ton. And that will be a headwind back half of the year. So I'd be cautious about signaling an improvement because we're facing that dynamic. But overall, relatively similar trends and we're hoping that we can move this in a relatively more positive direction over time, as we continue to build out these other service lines and grow our international presence.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Hey, Brian, can you give us a little more background on the $5 million legal accrual that we got in the quarter?
Brian P. McKeon: Yes, we tend to not want to get into specifics on legal accruals, but we had a customer dispute that's been going on for a number of years, goes back a number of years, I should say, in terms of the time period we're looking at. And we're booking accrual related to that. It's not anything that is operationally oriented. And just given the size of it, Kevin, that's sort of a cumulative effect of something that's kind of impacted a number of years, it was large enough for us to highlight that so that we don't give you a distorted view of what our underlying operational trends are. But it's relatively unusual and just it's related more to a customer agreement.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Got it. And then I just want to make sure, and I think I heard you right, but the incremental step up in the E&P, that was all International? Because it -- in terms of the step up, because I think the range, if I had it right, was kind of $300 million to $800 million, now it's an incremental $500 million to $1 billion. That was kind of all International true up? Or it had nothing to do with potentially going out to 2015 on the REIT conversion, right?
Brian P. McKeon: Just to clarify the numbers, we originally had $1 billion to $1.5 billion, and we're taking it to $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion, so it's a $200 million increase. And it reflects -- just more detailed. As you might imagine, it's a complicated exercise trying to go back in time and calculate the exact kind of cumulative earnings and profits by country of what we've earned over time, and the increase reflects updated estimates for the International business. There isn't a change in terms of the time frame we're looking at. This is related to the countries that we anticipate converting in 2014 with our initial wave one, if you will, and assuming we're successful with the REIT process.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Got it. And then just any sense of timing from when you'll hear back from the IRS, just given the decision to move the investor day? Is that kind of a reasonable proxy that we should hear before the investor day, or around that, any sense of timing on when we'll get some type of clarity?
William L. Meaney: Kevin, we can't really say anything more than we've already said in the 8-K. So we just moved the investor day because we felt that doing it in October, if we haven't got clarity one way or the other, it would be a bit early to do that. So -- but I wouldn't read anything into it because we can't say more than we've already told you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Shui with Stifel Nicolaus.
Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Can you guys give us the North America...
William L. Meaney: Steven, can you speak up? Because we can't hear you.
Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Can you guys give us the North America volume growth number and talk about how that's been trending versus expectations?
Brian P. McKeon: Sure, the volume growth was down 0.2%, so relatively flat, consistent with recent trends and consistent with expectations and where we are. We're advancing a number of initiatives, including the vertical initiatives that Bill can talk to, that our goal is to improve that rate over time. But I would say the underlying trend is consistent with where we've been.
William L. Meaney: Yes, there has -- it's almost dead on where we were for the year in 2012. But I think one of the reasons why we're talking about the verticals, and we highlighted 2 verticals where -- which are ones that we had stood up before we had made the major change, where we're actually showing positive storage growth, is because I think now, I think I've said on a previous call, is in the mature markets is that getting after the volume now is much more kind of underground mining, whereas before, maybe it was more like opencast. So we have to be much more precise and much more diligent. That being said, I will highlight that in every Western European country, we are in positive storage growth, on an internal basis. So it's -- the trend hasn't changed in North America, but we're making some changes along the vertical line to try to improve that performance.
Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, got it. And assuming there's no word on the PLR by the beginning of 2014, how will that affect how you manage the business going into the year in terms of your IT and legal systems? And maybe you can also give us some color on if there's a plan B if the PLR comes back negative.
Brian P. McKeon: So on your first question, I think we are, as noted, continue to advance work to do -- to be ready for our Jan 1, 2014 goal, and the systems that we're putting in place in terms of financial systems, things of that nature, will have benefit for our business regardless, in terms of kind of standard platforms and kind of standardized ways of looking at information. It's actually accelerated investments that we would've made as a company over time. So we'll see benefits from that going forward. As Bill noted, we can't really speculate at this point on timing of a process, but we think it's prudent to continue to move forward with those investments, and we'll get benefit in our business overall. In terms of a plan B, if you will, so if we were in a position that we weren't moving forward with converting to a REIT, just to reinforce some things that we've said in the past, we would be pursuing, as a company, the same business and capital allocation strategy. We expect to generate -- continue to generate substantial cash flow. We've indicated that we estimate we'd have about 70% of our free cash flow, x real estate the way that we defined it publicly, available for distribution to shareholders. That's a longer-term kind of an average, assuming a moderate level of M&A investment, $100 million to $150 million a year. And obviously, we don't convert, we wouldn't have the benefit of some of the tax savings that come from that, the discipline associated with the REIT structure. But we'd still have substantial flexibility to support financial payouts. And we'd expect to do that through a combination of a growing dividend, which right now is about 60% of our free cash flow, and likely, some level of share repurchases. So we haven't defined that plan specifically. But directionally, it's the same business and capital allocation strategy, we continue to generate substantial cash flow and we'd be continuing to drive payouts to shareholders, including a growing dividend.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Brian, correct me if I'm right about this in kind of footnote #1 of your 2013 outlook, which is now 0% to 2% internal growth. That is a little bit of a bump up from the last estimate we had, which included a negative 1 at the low end. What's caused this kind of lean forwards?
Brian P. McKeon: It's really rounding, Andrew. I think it's fundamentally the same outlook. We took the opportunity given the FX changes to kind of like fold through kind of relook overall. But I would say it's fundamentally the same outlook. We have -- we do have some incremental benefit from acquisition kind of flowing through. It's small, but it's nothing -- there isn't -- fundamentally, there isn't a change in sort of our operating outlook from where we were. It's consistent, excluding the FX changes.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right, and what would be a D&A estimate for the year?
Brian P. McKeon: I think we have that in the slides for you. It's...
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I missed that.
Brian P. McKeon: It's in the final appendix numbers. Right now, it's...
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, I didn't get up to the appendix, yet. And then just to make sure we model the FX correctly. Because that's what you're calling out here. You called it $40 million for the year. How much will FX have as a drag on third and fourth quarter in terms of growth rates?
Brian P. McKeon: I believe it's about 1.5 points, 1 point to 1.5 points.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I was wondering, so Brambles obviously announced that they're going to be spinning off Recall, as its own publicly traded entity. I guess my question is have you seen any change in strategy as they start to think about themselves as an independent entity? And also how does that maybe change the dynamic on the M&A opportunities that are out there, considering that they'll be infused with maybe a little bit more capital going forward?
William L. Meaney: Well, I think it's too early to tell. I mean they've just made their announcement, although the company, you can say, has been in play or under discussion for a while. I think that net-net, from our standpoint, it's a good thing because I think having a company that is not in the dressing up stage for sale but rather operating in the public markets like we are, then I think we would expect them to be competing on a purely rational basis, not looking towards a transaction. So I think that's always a good thing from our standpoint. I think -- it's the -- so I think net-net for us, it's a positive. Whether or not they will be more aggressive in terms of acquisitions, I mean, they've been aggressive in terms of acquisitions before. They've always been competing with us in the past, and there's other people that compete with us in acquisitions. So I think overall, we welcome them to the forum of being a public company.
Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then Brian, just a quick one. What was the EBITDA contribution from the acquisitions that you completed this quarter? Do you have a number for this year or maybe a full year run rate?
Brian P. McKeon: It's small for the full year. Acquisitions year-to-date, it's about $2 million additive. So it's -- and that's net of the initial integration cost. Obviously, those get more accretive over time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Brian, in the press release, it calls out the declines in service revenue moderating, one of the reasons being increased special records management project volume. Could you take us a level deeper on that, and if it's a trend that could persist?
Brian P. McKeon: Well, it's been a focus area for us for a while, but I think as we've -- it's early on, but as we increase the focus around serving vertical segments and having our sales organization aligned with them, I think we're identifying opportunities to customers, not just through storage, but through some transitions that they work in terms of how they're managing their organization. So it is something that we're hopeful to be a continued positive trend. And it's consistent with our business focus. So I think the -- I do want to reinforce, the kind of the main change from Q1 to Q2 is kind of get working through some tough lapping. We had some customer losses that we worked, in shredding in International, we worked through some of those things. But look, we're encouraged with their progress on their front, and we do have some ongoing headwinds that are -- kind of constrain growth. The query-based service activity continues to be a challenge, and right now, paper will be a bit of a challenge. But overall, we feel good that we're on the right track with the strategy.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And then just looking across your major verticals, legal, health care, could you give us a feel -- and others, could you give us a feeling as to just trends within them, and in particular, health care?
William L. Meaney: Well, I think in health care, I highlighted in the remarks that we're seeing about a 3% year-on-year growth in storage. But I think that if you look at the services, we continue to feel the headwinds. Because the service mainly, historically, in health care has been about active file or in terms of retrieving -- when hospitals need to retrieve people's medical files. And of course, that's going electronic. So what we've done now with the vertical is we've gone into new areas and mined deeper within the health care client -- customers, helping them make themselves paperless in their operations and get the paper out of there and stored properly. So much more of an archival trend. But as you see, it's -- we're getting significant year-on-year improvement in terms of the amount of storage volume we're getting. And I think I highlighted in the last call, bear in mind also that margin for us on storage is about 2x what it is on the service. So we continue to see a trend towards the electronic medical record, which takes away some of the service revenue that we had before on active file. But at the same time, we're getting into new areas, and helping our customers store even more offsite, and we like those trends.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Anything notably outstanding in legal or financial services, or has that been fairly consistent with the past?
William L. Meaney: That's been pretty much consistent in the past. Those are 2 areas where the vertical -- we've stood up the verticals this year, so they're relatively new in those areas. So it's too early to really say how that is progressing. But I think, right now, it's trending pretty much consistent with the past.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Berg with Post Advisory Group.
Andrew Berg - Post Advisory Group, LLC: Two questions, just housekeeping. Going back to the legal accrual, that goes back over how many years?
Brian P. McKeon: It's over a decade.
Andrew Berg - Post Advisory Group, LLC: Okay. And with respect to realigning the sales force in the different verticals, is that completed now across all verticals or are you still rolling that out among some?
William L. Meaney: It's pretty much completed, but the one thing I just want to highlight is it's work in progress. Because as we stood them up, we look at making sure that we've picked the right verticals and we're getting the benefits that we want. So yes, we have done the realignment and we've set the organization up, but it's one of these things where we have clear metrics around each of those and we continue to evaluate them.
Andrew Berg - Post Advisory Group, LLC: And from the ones you did earlier to the ones you did most recently, how much of a differential in performance are you seeing?
William L. Meaney: Well, I think the 2 that I've highlighted, the ones that's been up the longest, which is both life sciences and health care, and we're seeing, as I said 3%, roughly 3% to 3.5% year-on-year storage growth in those 2. Overall in North America, as Brian highlighted earlier, we're down about 0.2% in terms of physical storage growth year-on-year. So you can see the difference that we're getting in those 2. But I'm not going to try to -- I think it would be dangerous to extrapolate across the board. But that's -- we are -- it is one, and it's not the only thing we're doing, but it is one of the things that we're doing to try to mimic similar performance that we're getting out of mature markets in Europe in terms of physical storage growth. As I said, this is much more like going from opencast mining to underground mining. Part of the tools and the drills that we're deploying to get at the -- get at the storage revenue is this verticalization of the sales and marketing groups.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn today's call back over to your presenters for closing remarks.
William L. Meaney: Thank you, operator. To wrap up, our 2013 performance is on track. It's driven by the consistent growth in our storage rental business. And we believe we have numerous opportunities to sustain that growth in both developed and emerging markets through our vertical market focus, our innovative tools and services that drive incremental opportunities and attractive acquisitions. And we continue to make progress on preparations for our planned conversion to a REIT. As we move forward through the year and sharpen our focus on the key drivers of value for our business, we will, as always, continue to focus on prudent capital allocation, maximizing total returns and delivering sustainable value to our shareholders. Thank you for joining us this morning and have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Bonnie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Melissa Marsden. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Melissa Marsden: Thank you, Bonnie, and welcome, everyone to our first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for the company. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our CEO, who will discuss highlights and strategic initiatives; followed by Brian McKeon, our CFO, who will cover financial results. After their prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for 2013 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, can be found at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Meaney.
William L. Meaney: Thanks, Melissa, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We're off to a good start in 2013 with first quarter financial results in line with our expectations. Total revenues were $747 million, adjusted OIBDA was $227 million and adjusted earnings per share was $0.27 per share. Operating performance also is tracking in line with our full year ranges with consistent storage rental constant dollar growth of 4.4% and storage rental internal growth of 3%. As noted in recent quarters, we continued to see a decrease in activity-based services. These trends continue, but we are able to offset these impacts to deliver solid profit results. I'll turn it over to Brian to cover the details of our results in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to talk about what we're seeing in our markets and some of the ways in which we plan to sustain the durability of our core business. Since our last report to you, we've continued to make progress on many fronts and have integrated our strategic review into the budget process for 2014. More specifically, some of the areas of focus include: preparing to operate as a REIT; continue to emphasize organic growth, both in the mature and emerging markets; expanding through acquisitions which are accretive and which meet our strategic and financial hurdles; and evaluating close-in adjacencies. With respect to the REIT, we are moving forward with plans to build on our solid foundation and enhance our strategy. As we've said before, we can't comment on the specifics of our PLR, or Private Letter Ruling. We can say that in general, the process can take about a year, but we don't control the timing. As you know, we filed our PLR in mid-July 2012 and we continue to prepare for conversion moving full steam ahead with systems upgrades and the legal and tax restructuring necessary to move some of our International businesses into QRS. We have accomplished much, but there's more work to do. Additionally, we continue to advance our thinking about real estate investment opportunities and how we present the attractive characteristics of our business that align well with other REITs. As we've said previously, we have very high rental revenue per square foot and the quality and durability of our storage net operating income is exceptional, with extremely low volatility across business cycles. We also have a high credit quality customer base characterized by strong retention and relatively low maintenance and turnover costs. We believe these characteristics will continue to support the solid fundamentals of our business and will be of interest to investors seeking both attractive current and total shareholder returns. Turning now to operations. We continued to see good growth opportunities in both our developed and emerging markets. By developed, I'm referring not only to our North American markets of Canada and the U.S., but also to Australia, Singapore, the U.K., as well as Western Europe, where our business continues to perform well despite financial market uncertainty and challenging macroeconomic conditions. There are several ways we look to sustain the durability of the business in our developed markets. One is by enhancing our industry-specific expertise in vertical markets and adding value for customers through tailored solutions around Records Management and demonstrating how our solutions address their requirements, whether they are regulatory, commercial or operational in nature. Another is by differentiating our core storage and service offerings with innovative tools that drive incremental storage from existing customers and attract new customers. We are encouraged by early visibility into our pipeline of booked business and active pursuits. This pipeline is slightly more skewed towards new customer relationships, demonstrating the potential in the unvended or partially unvended market. Generally speaking, there is a long lead time between sizable new bookings and implementation, so we expect very little of this new business pipeline to be reflected in our 2013 results. On our last call, I mentioned the realignment of our sales and marketing teams to focus on vertical market opportunities. It's early days, but we're making progress. We pioneered this focus in the health care vertical and achieved a storage volume increase of 2% year-over-year in the first quarter in North America. The growth from our higher margin storage rental revenues is offsetting expected pressures from lower margin services, impacted by shifts towards electronic medical records. Given the storage margins are more than 2x that of service, this shift in the health care vertical has led to an overall increase in profit contribution. Additionally, we are receiving great feedback from customers who view us as their source for insight into industry best practices. We have expanded forums such as the customer advisory board and industry symposiums to bring top customers together to discuss challenges and opportunities. Based on insight from our financial services advisory board, 2 subcommittees have already been formed to help shape future products and services. Another example of our vertical market focus is the federal government. While not a significant part of our business today, we believe there is a sizable opportunity tied to the 2012 Presidential Directive on Records Management. This directive facilitates federal agencies in better using records to assess the impact of programs, reduce redundant efforts, save money and share knowledge within and across their organizations. We recently cosponsored a study that found federal government records are expected to grow from 8.5 billion to more than 20 billion records over the next 2 years. Whilst the bulk of the new federal records are being created electronically, 41% of those documents ultimately are printed and managed in paper format, underscoring the durability of growth in the physical record storage. Our penetration of this vertical segment is progressing slowly, but we recently completed a deal to store 250,000 cubic feet of veterans claims records with potential to add document management services. What we're finding is the federal government has historically awarded contracts to small systems integrators that don't always have the capability or the full know-how to service the business once they get it. We're seeing real opportunities to partner with these smaller integrators in order to establish our foothold in this vertical segment. Moreover, we continue to be confident that the federal government will increasingly need to outsource Records Management with the private sector, given their fiscal constraints. In addition to our vertical market approach, we are advancing our go-to-market approach to help differentiate our core storage and service offerings and as a means to tap the unvended market. We've identified multiple unique customer types, ranging from the pure physical storage outsourcer to the workflow digitizer seeking to convert all physical records to digital and several variations in between. By customizing our approach, we can better map our solutions to each type of customer, integrating more consultative services. An example of an offering for the sophisticated customer looking to unify records is our Accutrac solution, which enables organizations to centralize the management of both physical and electronic records, helping them find records faster and lower risks of noncompliance, as well as cutting storage costs. Let me now turn to emerging market opportunities. By emerging, I'm referring to the BRIC countries, as well as other Latin American countries like Chile, Argentina, Central and Eastern Europe, countries like Turkey, the Czech Republic and Poland, as well as other Asia Pacific markets, such as Hong Kong. Our emerging markets currently represent about a $300 million business for us and we have significant opportunities to expand our platform in these fast-growing countries through both acquisitions and organic growth, positioning ourselves to capture the first wave of outsourcing. In the aggregate, these emerging markets achieved storage rental constant dollar revenue growth of 30% in the first quarter or 17% when excluding our recent acquisition of Grupo Store in Brazil last year. Moreover, we have a solid pipeline of potential acquisition candidates in emerging markets. Many of these deals would accelerate the growth of our business into leadership positions, which as we've noted in the past, is a driver of incremental margin improvement in our International markets. As we've noted, many of these emerging markets are early in their process of outsourcing records management. We have opportunities to enhance our growth in emerging markets by leveraging the solution-based product and service offerings we originated and refined in our developed markets, where we've been in operation for much longer and implementing those programs in our emerging markets. By helping customers early in the outsourcing process to become more efficient and reduce costs, we will become a trusted partner and ultimately drive more business. We are also continuously evaluating close-in adjacent businesses that support our core Records Management business and meet our return hurdles, and we will continue to evaluate these opportunities through ROE, cash flow and return on invested capital filters. We have recently announced our plans to move forward with expansion of the underground wholesale data center in Pennsylvania that we talked about at Investor Day last October. Again, it is early in the process but we are encouraged by initial customer demand, and we will prudently evaluate the opportunity through this initial effort before undertaking incremental investment. Part of our investigation will include looking at the feasibility of above ground wholesale data centers on existing Iron Mountain land. We believe we can continue to deliver sustainable value and support business growth by targeting 25% to 35% of our free cash flow for investment in emerging markets, acquisitions and adjacencies. We believe this level of investment would be similar under our existing structure or as a REIT, and is consistent with our capital allocation approach through which we also maximize cash flow, generate strong returns and maintain significant payouts to our stockholders. To wrap up, we have a great business with good momentum, supported by a strategy to sustain our growth over the long term. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian to discuss our financial results in more detail.
Brian P. McKeon: Thanks, Bill. Let's turn now to Slide 3 which highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered good operating results in Q1, driven by a consistent storage rental growth which supported solid profit performance. Overall growth trends were consistent. Storage rental growth grew 4.4% on a constant dollar basis in the quarter, supported by 2% gains in North America and 12% growth in International, including benefits from our 2012 acquisitions in Brazil and Europe. While storage growth remains solid, we saw similar declines in query-based core service activity leading to lower retrievable refile and transportation revenues in mature markets. Service growth declines were a bit higher in Q1, as expected, reflecting some tougher comparisons in International markets, as well as declines in storage destruction and termination fees. We expect these impacts to moderate as we work through the year. Adjusted OIBDA was up 2% and on-track with our full year outlook. Our profit results continue to be supported by International margin gains and sustained cost controls. Overall, Q1 was in line with our expectation, supported by solid storage growth, strong International gains and continued efficiencies in capital investment. Today, we're reiterating our full year 2013 performance outlook. In addition to our revenue and profit performance, our capital expenditures and free cash flow generation are all tracking to plan. Let's move on to Slide 4 to review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the first quarter of 2012. As noted, Q1 results were as expected, supported by solid storage rental growth. Enterprise revenues grew 0.5% on a constant dollar basis, as our International segment continued to produce strong revenue performance. International posted 7% constant dollar revenue growth, supported by 12% storage rental growth, including benefits from our acquisitions in Brazil and Switzerland. North America posted minus 2% constant currency revenue growth, as lower service revenues more than offset consistent 2% storage rental gains. Year-on-year changes in recycled paper prices and FX rates had minimal impact in the quarter. Gross profit was $426 million in Q1, yielding a gross margin of 57%, down 80 basis points compared to the same prior year period. Storage gross margins increased 40 basis points, reflecting good cost management with growing revenues. Service gross margins were down year-over-year due to decreased revenues from the lower core service activities. Mix impacts from 2012 acquisitions was also a contributing factor. Adjusted OIBDA was $227 million, up 2% year-on-year. Adjusted OIBDA margins improved to 30.5% of revenues in Q1, driven by lower SG&A expense, excluding REIT costs. Our underlying profit performance continues to improve in our International segment, consistent with our plans. International adjusted OIBDA margins increased 100 basis points in Q1, as we remain on-track to achieve 25% margins in 2013. Savings from the North American sales and account management realignment and lower stock option compensation expense were also contributing factors to the year-on-year increase in adjusted OIBDA. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.27 per share compared to $0.29 in Q1 2012. The decrease was due to the higher number of shares outstanding following the issuance of 17 million new shares last November as part of our special dividend. Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS exclude the impact of costs associated with the REIT conversion. These costs reduced Q1 2013 reported EPS by $0.09 per share net of tax. GAAP earnings per share of $0.10 includes $25 million of REIT costs and $3 million of other expense, partially offset by $1 million of gains on asset dispositions. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 38%. Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows the components building to our overall revenue growth. Q1 growth rates were in line with our expectation and our -- with our expectations and our full year outlook. In terms of components building to overall growth, storage rental internal growth was 2.5% for the quarter, service internal growth was minus 6.5% and total revenue internal growth was minus 1.4%. Acquisitions and FX changes combined to add 1.4% to our reported results. Overall, our durable storage rental business provides a solid foundation for our overall revenue performance. For the quarter, consistent storage rental growth of 4.4% on a constant dollar basis supported total constant dollar revenue growth of 0.5%. Year-on-year global net volume growth was 2.8%, including about 1.1% benefit related to the store acquisition in Brazil. North America reported 2% constant dollar storage rental growth, reflecting relatively flat Records Management volume and consistent pricing trends. International storage rental growth was 12% constant dollar for the quarter, reflecting sustained double-digit growth in Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe and Asia Pac. For the year, we expect overall storage rental to sustain consistent growth rates of about 4% on a constant dollar basis and about 3% on an internal basis. Total services decreased 5% constant dollar as expected headwinds in activity-based services continued, and we faced some tougher near-term comparisons in International. These impacts more than offset solid DMS growth and benefits from our 2012 acquisitions. The International segment posted 1% service growth supported by acquisitions, DMS growth and higher project revenues, which more than offset lower shredding revenues due to some customer terminations in early 2012. We've now lapped those terminations and should have better comps as we move forward through the balance of the year. Overall, North American service revenues declined 7% in the quarter with about 4% of that decline related to activity-based core services. Gains in DMS revenues were offset by lower revenues from special projects and ancillary service lines, including entertainment and fulfillment services. Paper prices had limited impact in Q1 as sorted office paper pricing has stabilized recently in the $150 to $160 per ton range. Assuming stable recycled paper prices, we expect to see improvement in our service revenue growth rates as we work through the year, supported by gains in our International segments and from increases in DMS revenues as we continue to build this business. Let's take a look at our segment performance on Slide 6. Slide 6 shows key metrics for each of our 3 segments comparing Q1 of this year to Q1 2012. Consistent with our business strategy, we're sustaining high returns in our North America segment while we continue to build our International segment as a significant driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. For Q1, our North American business segment reported revenues of $542 million, supported by consistent 2% constant dollar storage rental gains. We sustained adjusted OIBDA margins of 41%, as savings from our recent sales and account management realignment offset a decrease in gross profits due to lower service revenues. We're also sustaining capital efficiencies with spending at 4.4% of revenues, excluding real estate. Our International segment continues to post strong constant dollar revenue, adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. Adjusted OIBDA increased 10% on a constant dollar basis, benefiting from cost improvement initiatives in Western European markets and strong profit performance in Asia Pac. International adjusted OIBDA margins expanded about 100 basis points. Benefits from productivity initiatives and from continued solid growth across our International portfolio have us on-track towards our goal of about 25% margins in 2013. Finally, corporate expenses were down compared to prior year levels, reflecting benefits from overhead cost controls and lower stock option expense. Overall, we continued to drive solid operating performance across our portfolio consistent with our performance. Let's now take a look at our debt statistics on Slide 7. Strong consistent cash flow generation enables us to maintain a sound balance sheet. Currently, we're operating with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.95x at the high end of our targeted 3x to 4x leverage range. Our leverage ratio has increased over the past 2-plus years as planned to support cash shareholder payouts of $1.6 billion and expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT over that period. As we've stated previously, the cost associated with REIT conversion, including tax payments, will temporarily and modestly push our leverage over the high end of our target range. We're well-positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was more than $800 million with $230 million in cash and $612 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our strong cash flow support continued advancement of our capital allocation strategy and our REIT conversion. During the first quarter, we paid $52 million in cash dividends and $31 million of REIT costs, including $6 million of REIT-related CapEx. We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy, while advancing substantial payouts to shareholders and we remain well-positioned to fund our business plan. That concludes our review of the Q1 2013 results. Overall, this was a good quarter in which we continued to drive solid financial performance, supported by storage rental gains and position ourselves to achieve our full year 2013 financial goals. Let's now turn to Slide 8 to review our 2013 outlook. Slide 8 summarizes our current 2013 operating outlook. Today, we're reiterating our full year 2013 guidance. Our Q1 performance was as expected and consistent with our full year outlook. We expect to sustain consistent storage rental growth and to see improvement in our service revenue growth rates through the balance of the year. As we've been highlighting, we anticipate significant one-time operating and capital costs associated with our potential conversion to a REIT. These costs relate to substantial system investments, legal and tax work, advisory fees and other miscellaneous costs to implement the proposed structure. Total operating expense and capital costs are estimated to be between $150 million and $200 million, with the majority of these costs to be incurred in 2013. We're investing to ensure that we meet the January 1, 2014 deadline including having our REIT-critical systems operating on a test basis by the third quarter of this year. For 2013, we expect to incur between $65 million and $95 million of incremental expense, between $30 million and $45 million of CapEx and to pay $105 million to $115 million in additional taxes related to the depreciation recapture in connection with the REIT conversion. The impact of these items will be a reduction of reported EPS of $0.26 to $0.36 per share and a use of cash of $185 million to $230 million. We'll continue to track and report these costs discretely from our underlying operating results. Slides laying out our outlook for line items below adjusted OIBDA, as well as the REIT-related items are included in the Appendix. That concludes our review. In summary, Q1 was a quarter of good financial performance and we're well-positioned to achieve our 2013 financial goals. We continue to execute against our business plans, sustaining high profits and cash flow in North America and driving strong growth and higher returns in our International business. We continue to advance work in connection with the REIT conversion as part of our long-term approach to enhance value creation for stockholders. Thank you, we'd now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Bill, I'd love to kind of get your thoughts, your first quarter out of the gate, any upside surprises, downside? It's kind of interesting it -- you really get a sense of the durability of the business model within all the additional responsibility in terms of managing through the REIT conversion process. So just any thoughts on that initially would be helpful.
William L. Meaney: Kevin, I think not really any big surprise. We're tracking as planned. I think the only thing that coming is from an outsider coming in, it's always good to see that even though Europe is not doing well from a macroeconomic standpoint -- if you look at the mature markets in Western Europe, is we continued to have solid, physical growth in terms of the -- in terms of storage rental. So we're still tracking quite well even in the mature markets. And then, emerging markets, we're continuing to find more and more upside. So I've been spending quite a bit of my time internationally over the last month or so, and we do have real opportunities there and it's starting to show in our results. So no real surprises, I think we're pretty much within expectations. But it's nice to see that things are tracking ahead.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Great. And then Brian, it looks like we're able to update kind of the REIT-related and other expenditures out through kind of '14 to '16. And I know we can't comment on the PLR, but any sense of what gave us the confidence to do that. Just within the context of the PLR overall would be helpful.
Brian P. McKeon: Well, I think we've said all along that going through this process, we felt we had good arguments on the key issue areas that we need to resolution in the PLR and it's not certain. That's why we need to get feedback from the IRS, but we feel confident in our arguments and made the decision to move forward with the investments, because we need to, given the scope and complexity of our conversion effort to make sure that we're on track for the January 1 conversions. So the estimates that we provided, Kevin, are consistent with what we've highlighted in the past. I think we're just giving you some clarity on how that's playing out in terms of the phasing in 2013. But it's the same range we've been highlighting.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: No, no, no, I know that. I guess, I thought the '14 to '16, that incremental data was new. It looked like the '13 range was consistent, but I hadn't seen the '14 to '16 so I didn't know if that was something that -- just what drove the decision to provide that.
Brian P. McKeon: I think it's consistent with what we've been sharing so...
William L. Meaney: Yes, Kevin. If we had put that out previously and it's really more to do with like the timing of tax payments, primarily that drags it out to '16. There are a couple of conversions that would likely take place past 12/31/13 which are also in that column, but we've put that out before.
Brian P. McKeon: It's all consistent with the same plan we've been outlining.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Tong of Piper Jaffray.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: I just wanted to get some additional color around your progress in converting your systems to be REIT-compliant by the end of this year and to begin operating as a REIT by the beginning of next year. Could you discuss your progress there? And how you expect the rollout to progress as we move forward?
Brian P. McKeon: Sure, no. We again are targeting to be ready for the election on January 1. And to be positioned to do that, we have to align our legal entities internationally and we have the initial countries that we're converting, which is the U.S. and several other countries and need to have all our information systems aligned so that we can measure performance in qualified REIT subsidiaries, taxable REIT subsidiaries, and ensure that we're complying with the key requirements like the asset test. So we're -- to do that effectively, we're touching a lot of our ERP systems. We have more than one in our company. We've used different versions in International operations. We're in the midst of the heavy lifting of all of that and preparing for kind of a transition over in -- this summer so that we can test this well in advance of the January 1 conversion. And I would say, there's a ton of work going on. We're obviously investing a lot behind that, but everything is on-track, and we feel good about the progress that we're making there.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then, as a follow-up question, could you discuss the dynamics in your various International markets as it relates to storage growth? And any opportunities you're seeing in specific countries and strategies you have to increase the performance of some of the markets that you may not be a leader in currently?
William L. Meaney: Well, I think that -- thanks, George. I think, let's kind of divide the International between 2 groups, so the emerging and the mature markets. On the mature side, I think we continue to see some opportunity for tuck-in acquisitions. But even absent of that, we have seen consistently over a number of quarters now is solid -- not just solid revenue growth around storage, but also solid cube growth. So absolutely showing that where people are storing more and more paper and tapes with us during that period. So that's good to see and that's both in countries where we have already established our market-leading position and those of countries where we are not in a market-leading position. And in mature markets, obviously, we have to be more thoughtful in terms of looking at acquisitions that truly complement our current operations and build in terms of our franchise. In the emerging markets, we have, first of all, very strong fundamental underlying growth. But there's also, in a number of countries, we've already established our market-leading position, like Chile, but we're also finding other countries where there's good acquisition opportunities to continue to build on those franchises. And as I say, the underlining franchise themselves are showing very high physical storage growth and revenue growth. In addition, in a number of the emerging markets, specifically around Latin America, we're finding a lot of growth around BPM, or Business Process Management. And that many cases leads us to have even a stickier relationship with a number of our customers. In fact, the number of our customers start with more -- with our work around BPM or managing some of their paper processes and then it leads to storage, rather than the other way around. But as I say, it strengthens our relationship with those customers and we're showing good growth both on the Business Process Management, whilst it has a lower margin, but it has a very high return on invested capital and as I say, and continued strong underlying growth in the physical storage business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann of Baird.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I wanted to just dig in a little bit on your comments, Bill, on M&A. It sounds like you're looking at a lot of stuff right now. I think previously, we were thinking about the company over kind of like a 10-year period and thinking $100 million a year was kind of the right way to think about what capital allocation to M&A could be. Is that, in the near term, maybe elevated from that level based on what you're seeing out there today?
William L. Meaney: It's hard to comment at this point. We're pretty -- we're very disciplined in terms of our acquisition process. And right now, we're not constrained by capital, but we are seeing more and more opportunities and, as I say, International expansion is an important part of our strategy. We did, as you know, a fairly large acquisition last year in Brazil. We continue to see acquisitions in our pipeline. I think you can expect that we'll continue on that trend. To say what our total appetite is in terms of expenditure around that at this point, it's hard to say, but I wouldn't change our guidance at this stage. But we are aggressively looking at what makes sense from an acquisition standpoint and we will continue to do that. But as I said, it was a very clear view in terms of what our hurdle rates are in terms of return.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Got it. And just in terms of managing the balance sheet, maybe Brian on this, you're going to poke a little bit above the targeted level. How comfortable are you about going -- or how high would you go and for how long would you go if the right deal came around above that kind of targeted range?
Brian P. McKeon: Yes, that's a good question. I mean, as a company, we've operated above 5x leverage. I'm not saying that that's what we'd be targeting to do. But I mean, I think our business has a lot of capacity to support higher leverage. I think we would look at it in the context of the opportunity. We'd likely perhaps move more towards the 5x range if we needed to temporarily. But I think we'd look at different alternatives and what's the right way to finance the acquisition, too, if we get something more significant. But our longer-term goals are the same. The intent would be to manage our leverage back down towards the 3x to 4x target range. And we feel quite comfortable with the business that we have, that we can both manage the short term and get back to where we're hoping to be over the long term.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And maybe just one more, kind of on this theme. Bill, you kind of talked about you're exploring wholesale data centers on existing land. I think strategically, it makes some sense from a high level, just given your focus on data management and outsourcing key data protection services. But obviously, you're clearly a technically more complex business in terms of what the building actually is and there are specialized developers and owners of that real estate today. As you look at potentially getting into that business, is this something you think you have the skill set in-house? Or is this an area that you think you'd have to kind of bring in a platform to do that?
William L. Meaney: A good question. Well, first of all, I think we start getting into this business because our customers asked us to start providing services. So as you know, we're already providing wholesale data center service to 7 customers in our underground facility as we sit here today. And it's pretty much along the lines that you're saying is that there is an opportunity to continue to both expand that business and then, when we look at what customers want is our underground facility outside Pittsburgh is more of a disaster recovery site and a number of the customers are also asking for wholesale data center services or retail services that service their day-to-day data processing needs. And those need to be closer to their headquarters or their centers of operation. So there's a link between aboveground and underground facilities. That being said, both because the question you asked and do we have the full skill set in-house and because it is a market where there are a number of competitors, is we're doing it in a very thoughtful way in letting our customers lead us into these arrangements rather than spending a lot of capital upfront and building it and see if they come, if you know what I mean. And we are as part of this process adding the right people at the right spots. But this is not large numbers of people, but it's actually hiring the right senior leadership team to support Mark Kidd, who is actually leading that effort for us, to make sure that we have the right critical skill set that can evaluate the opportunity properly.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of Barclays.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I wanted to first ask about the color on the pipeline of new business opportunities, in the commentary that you're optimistic and a lot of it is from new customers of the company. We haven't heard a lot of comments in the past around that pipeline. So can you give a little color on where you're seeing opportunities? And is this an acceleration from what the trend has been in recent years? And just what makes you have that positive commentary?
William L. Meaney: I wouldn't say it's an exploding trend. I think that similar to what we said I think -- I believe we said on the last call this verticalization, I think of it as a way of actually taking out the drill bits and doing the hard mining to get to the next level in the vein of resources. So it's similar along the lines of what we say, we're starting to see some what I call the green shoots in the federal market with our win in the veterans area. And we're seeing some green shoots in the health care area, which is the vertical that we've been operating in the longest, and we're getting into some related areas for our traditional health care clients, which is now almost a 1-for-1 set off on a revenue basis of what we were losing on the service side because the medical records becoming electronic. And yet it's at a -- it had more than a 2x margin because we're replacing that business, the service business, around electronic medical records with more physical storage in areas like pathology, but also in terms of other physical records that is a 1-for-1 almost trade-off in terms of revenue, but at more than 2x the margin. So this is a trend where, as I say, is through the verticalization is mining deeper either in our current client relationships or clients that are in that sector but have traditionally not outsourced or completely outsourced their storage business.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then just following up on that, can you give an example or 2 of how the offerings have changed in health care? Are you doing things different or is it really understanding the pain points for the customer and how to adopt the current offerings to help them relieve their issues?
William L. Meaney: It's a little bit of both. So I mean, one area and a new area which we've started in just the recent months is in the whole pathology area, which was an area that, oddly enough, we were in way back when through an acquisition we did in Boston, our first acquisition in Boston, but it's now a business that we're coming back into. As well, it has a number of areas where they weren't as sensitive to the documentation that they were keeping, either from a compliance standpoint or a space standpoint. So it's more areas where there was less sensitivity in terms of space and or compliance requirements and they now need to have those documents stored in a secure way. And the other side, as I say, is areas like pathology, which people now are realizing that those types of samples need to be stored in a proper way.
Brian P. McKeon: Gary, I'd also highlight that I think the dedicated sales focus in the health care vertical, we had other product offerings. We do DMS-type work, we have our product offering around digital records center for medical imaging. And being in the flow of all the change that's going on in the health care space has enabled our organization to identify opportunities, to do things like grow storage. So I think that part of the concept around the verticalization strategy is having more -- having sales and account management resources that have more specific industry insight. And by being involved with the changes that our customers are going through, we're better able to identify opportunities to do business with them. And that's certainly been the case in health care.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, that make sense. And then, just one last one which is, just what gives you confidence -- in the commentary I heard, a comment I heard a couple of times that you think the service declines will ease as we move through the year. Is it really just a comps issue or is there anything else going on?
William L. Meaney: It's a comp issue in that we knew we were up against, particularly in International, some shredding account losses and we had a DMS account that we're working through. And so we know we'll be up against more favorable compares. But also that we're targeting improved growth in areas like DMS as we work through the year and that will help as well. We just really wanted to highlight that this isn't a change in trend. This is a kind of a consistent underlying trend on activity-based volume. We do have some tougher comps and we expect those numbers to improve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.
Unknown Analyst: For Scott. Can you take us a little deeper on the drivers of International margins in the quarter, and if you see any particular dynamic that might enable you to exceed your long-term target there?
William L. Meaney: The key drivers there, we were having good underlying storage growth. In the International business, we had a 12% constant dollar, 5% internal, solid growth across the business. And I think that is a good -- helps everything. It's a high-margin business and helps us to build scales across our business. And we continued to see the flow-through benefits of the improvement plan in Western Europe. If you recall the portfolio review and the productivity improvement plan that we implemented, those benefits to continue to just flow through. We're comfortable that we're on track towards the goal that we outlined in the 2-year plan of the 25% margin growth. This achievement, this year, not signaling any upside to that. And we've indicated over time, we think there is room for additional margin improvement in International but want to temper our expectations there where we think future gains will be more moderate, and that we're really focused on maximizing the value opportunity there. But -- so no change in the expectations, but we feel good about the progress that we're making.
Brian P. McKeon: Yes, and just one thing to add to that, Scott, is remember -- and again, I think we mentioned this last time, you have to look at our International business, because of the growth potential there, as a portfolio. So as countries, for instance, if we take again Chile, which has amongst the highest margins of our operations worldwide, mature or emerging markets, is because if we've got our market-leading position there, there will be other places where we continue to build a market-leading position so it would generally drift those margins up. But we are adding in new areas where we have real opportunity. So it's a portfolio approach of adding less mature opportunities into a group of countries that may be getting more mature. So net-net, you have to -- it's not clear that it would even be the right strategy to say that our average margin would go up internationally because that would signal that we're not finding new markets to actually go into and eventually build a market-leading position. So you have to look at it as a portfolio approach in International. The key in International is to make sure that when we're doing acquisitions, we have a clear discipline in terms of our return on invested capital and return on equity. And we have a clear strategic vision of how that country or that investment will eventually build into a market-leading position.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Shui of Stifel.
Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: You guys had mentioned that the improvement in North American margins are partially due to the realignment of the sales force for the health care vertical. Can you give us a sense of how much North American margins can potentially improve as you guys realign the sales force verticals beyond health care?
William L. Meaney: We had a little trouble hearing you. But -- the end of the question you're saying how much more could North American margins increase?
Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Yes, once you realign the sales force beyond health care.
Brian P. McKeon: The sales force realignment that was done last year wasn't just related to health care, it was a broader realignment. And we've been consistently signaling, don't expect margin improvement in North America. I think we've got a very high margin business operation. We're trying to sustain that and be balanced about an appropriate level of investment to ensure we have a healthy and sustained annuity over time. So those efficiencies enabled us to sustain good returns and that's what you should expect for this year.
William L. Meaney: And just to emphasize Brian's comment, the verticalization is about maintaining our consistent storage revenue growth in North America. It's not about margin expansion. There was a one-time benefit of that in terms of the realignment to the sales force that allowed us to be more efficient. But the verticalization is really about to be able to maintain our consistent revenue growth performance around storage in North America.
Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And to change direction, given where paper prices are now at a relatively depressed level compared to last year, have you guys seen any improvement to the pricing environment for Shredding?
Brian P. McKeon: Paper prices have been in a relatively consistent range, $150 to $160 a ton, for several months now. So I think that stability, it's a bit below the longer-term averages, which would be in the $200 a ton range. And I think the Shredding business, we feel good about progress there. But I wouldn't signal that there's any meaningful change in kind of pricing dynamics. It's been a relatively stable environment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Could you go back to internal revenue change in core service, the minus 7 is kind of a larger number relative to last couple of years. Do you feel like the things that have affected the first quarter will meaningfully get better through the year? Or do you feel like this will be a year of larger declines in core service than we've experienced in the past?
Brian P. McKeon: Andrew, we were trending minus 3 to minus 4 internal growth Q3, Q4. If you look back to Q1 of last year, we had growth in core service. So this isn't a fundamental change. I mean, I think we're seeing very consistent kind of pressures on the mature market activity-based services and we would expect to move back towards more kind of the range that we were in the last couple of quarters and with opportunity to improve on that because we have goals that we have in terms of driving project-based revenue and building aspects of our business. So I think it's -- we're trying to signal don't take Q1 and trend that out in terms of a growth rate that's more reflecting lapping and some specific things. But I think the trends that we saw later last year are probably more indicative of where we'll be heading in the next couple of quarters.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: That's helpful, Brian, and one more question on the same subject. You also cited declines in destruction as part of that dynamic in core service. And whenever I hear declines in destruction, I often think that, that should help the storage revenues. Is that dynamic happening or is this a different type of destruction?
Brian P. McKeon: Well, we did see, in terms of the destruction and termination fees, it's not a huge driver of the number in North America, but it was lower in Q1, down double digits. Some of that's timing, so I don't want to indicate like a fundamental change there. But you're right, that is a relatively positive dynamic. I think it's reflective of a lot of the work that we've been doing over the last couple of years on customer retention, customer excellence and the benefits of that. So yes, it should be something that helps us over time. Some of -- to be fair, I mean, some of this is just timing and when things happen. But I think that is a theme that hopefully you are hearing here that we feel quite good about the storage dynamic. I think it's consistent, it's healthy. We're expanding our footprint globally and as that, our International business continues to grow, it has very healthy underlying growth rates. We're feeling good about that as a longer-term trend.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of Barclays.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Follow up. In thinking about all the investment you're doing in terms of preparing for the REIT, is that fully captured in the one-time cost and charges that you've been giving us that number for the REIT? Or are there some costs through SG&A and cost of sales that might fall off next year as you get through the process? And if so, how significant are those costs?
Brian P. McKeon: It won't fall off, Gary. It will go the other way candidly in the sense that we've been highlighting all along that as our anticipation, as we come through the conversion process, there's a whole bunch of one-time costs. We will have a level of incremental ongoing costs in we've -- our estimate, I believe, has been $10 million to $15 million. If you think about it, we're going to need additional tax resources, some additional financial resources, legal resources to just manage the incremental compliance requirements, things of that nature. We do anticipate that over time, we should get efficiencies as well out of this effort and that we're standardizing a lot of our systems and our approaches. I think that's going to take a little time to flow through because our focus really here is to make sure we're getting to the goal line on the right -- as quickly as we can and to make sure we don't miss that. But I wouldn't expect or I don't want to signal that we're going to see like a drop off in underlying costs. We really tried to be clear about segregating these costs and they're separate from our ongoing operational costs.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions.
William L. Meaney: Thank you, operator. To wrap up, we're off to a good start in 2013. Our durable growth in storage rental continues, we have attractive opportunities to sustain that growth through acquisitions and further expansion into emerging markets, as well as investment in our adjacent businesses -- opportunities. We are on track to deliver against our financial goals. We're making good progress on preparations for our planned conversion to a REIT and we have an attractive storage rental business with durable, high-quality net operating income that aligns well with REITs. As we continue to execute against our plan, we will be focused on prudent capital allocation, maximizing total returns and delivering sustainable value to our shareholders. Thank you for joining us this morning.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Bonnie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Call Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Melissa Marsden, SVP of IR. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Melissa Marsden: Thank you, Bonnie, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter and year-end 2012 earnings conference call. As Bonnie noted, I'm Melissa Marsden, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, and I just joined the company's IR team a few weeks ago. This morning, we'll hear from Bill Meaney, our new CEO, who will discuss highlights and the early focus areas; followed by Brian McKeon, our CFO, who will cover financial results and guidance. After their prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2013 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, can also be found at the Investor Relations page of our website, in addition to today's press release. With that, I'd like introduce our new CEO, Bill Meaney.
William L. Meaney: Thank you, Melissa. It's great to be here today. I've had the opportunity to meet with several of you since joining the company in January, and I look forward to getting to know our investors and analysts over the coming months. Before I get started, I'd like to just take a minute to welcome Melissa Marsden to Iron Mountain. Brian and his team have been working with Melissa as a consultant for some time, and she officially joined us in her current capacity as Senior Vice President of Investor Relations earlier this year. Melissa brings more than 25 years of Investor Relations experience across a range of industries, and most recently, she served as Managing Director of IR of ProLogis, which, as some of you probably know, is the global leader, the largest global industrial REIT, where she was named the top REIT IR officer by Institutional Investor. So we're very pleased to have Melissa here and the capabilities that she brings to our team as we work to expand Iron Mountain's investor base. Now that is the introduction to Melissa. Let me just kick off with a couple of comments on our performance, and then Brian will cover the details in a few minutes. Iron Mountain wrapped up another solid year, with revenues of $3 billion and adjusted OIBDA of $912 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, all in line with our expectations. In the fourth quarter, we continued to achieve strong constant dollar storage rental growth of 5%, underscoring the long-term durability of our business and providing a sturdy foundation for our overall financial performance. Our storage rental revenue growth reflected both healthy increases in our International business, as well as steady growth in our North American business, and offset a modest decline in our total service revenue, which was driven mainly by lower recycled paper prices. These stable fundamentals are what attracted me to Iron Mountain, namely a track record of durable growth, strong cash flow generation, high return opportunities in the international market and a great franchise with a strong culture. While many companies experienced wild swings in revenues as global economies peak and trough, Iron Mountain has the unique ability to sustain its growth rate throughout business cycles due to the attractive underlying stability of our storage business. I did my due diligence, and I believe we can sustain the durability of the business through opportunities in both the mature and emerging markets, as well as potential adjacencies. Be assured that as we pursue these opportunities, we will continue to view them through our capital allocation approach, which focuses on maximizing cash flow, generating strong returns and supporting the steady long-term growth of our core business. My near-term focus upon joining the company is to spend a good deal of time with customers, investors and our associates around the globe. I came away with a sense of opportunity related to the significant amount of unvended records that remain in the mature markets in both private and public sectors. One way in which we are addressing that is organizing our sales efforts into vertical segments such as health care, financial services, energy and government and a closer alignment between our sales and product management groups. It's early in the process, but we are pleased with the progress to date. This sector focus and Iron Mountain's strong customer relationships should, in time, give us permission to handle more data in record management processes for our customers and provide some higher value-added services. Additionally, Iron Mountain has an internationally recognized brand, yet only about 1/4 of our revenues today are generated outside North America. Overall, many of the emerging markets are still early in the records outsourcing process, supporting our continued expansion in international markets, which is a great fit with my background. I spent the last 27 years running multinational businesses from outside the United States, and I'm very comfortable with the process. To be clear, in my view -- in the view of Iron Mountain, international expansion is not about putting pins in the map. We will pursue entry into additional markets with an aggressive yet disciplined approach that is consistent with our focus on return on invested capital and where we can develop leadership positions over time. We are on track to achieve our goal of 700 basis points of International margin improvement by the end of 2013. Entering to new markets may flow further International margin expansion slightly in the early stages of market penetration, but as we've demonstrated in the past, once we achieve market leadership, our International margins are very consistent with those of our developed markets. Lastly, we look to invest where we can leverage the brand and build off our strengths but in areas that are adjacent to or directly tied to our core operational expertise. At Investor Day, Richard Reese talked about the opportunity for wholesale data centers, where we can provide the secure space and customers bring in their own technology. He highlighted that we are already doing this in our underground data center operations, where we're approaching a run rate of some USD 20 million in annual revenues, with substantial space to further expand. This is just one example of where customers came to us and asked for a specific product or service, and we'll continue to look at additional opportunities consistent with our core business. The combination of our durable leadership position in developed markets, emerging market opportunities and close-in adjacency provide a very solid foundation. I'm very confident in our ability to build on this position and to maintain steady, stable growth and strong cash flow. In short, I think we've got a great base from which to continue to drive sustainable value. Beyond the opportunities to sustain the durability of the business, I was really attracted by the nature of the organization. It's not often that one gets a chance to lead a company that has the kind of franchise that Iron Mountain does. The strength of our brand and the depth of our customer relationships, in my opinion, are unparalleled. The culture is refreshing and apolitical, something that is exceedingly rare in a global company. There is deep operational know-how, what I like to call the secret sauce, and its customers trust us with their critical documents, and it's what enables us to innovate and discuss with our customers how we can do more to improve the efficiency of their records management. There's also an overarching objective of driving returns through smart and disciplined capital allocation with a focus on long-term and sustainable growth. Assuming that we are successful with the Private Letter Ruling, or the PLR, the REIT will complement our core strategy and provide further certainty in our investment focus, resulting in a source of stable and growing shareholder returns. Financially, we will have the flexibility to fully support high-return investments to expand our network capacity, pursuing tuck-in acquisitions and geographic expansion opportunities, as well as acquiring real estate. We'll also retain the flexibility within the REIT test to expand closely related service opportunities as well. As we move through the PLL process -- with the PLR process with the IRS, we are working hard to advance our preparedness to operate as a REIT. We have invested heavily in people, processes and systems to enable us to be ready for conversion at the beginning of next year and are targeting the third quarter to have our REIT-critical systems in place. This aggressive timeline results in additional investment, which Brian will review, but this is the right time to invest to ensure we're dotting our Is and crossing our Ts. We're making a significant investment but one that pales in comparison to the incremental shareholder value we expect to be able to deliver as a REIT. As we continue to work on the REIT conversion, we have been familiarizing ourselves with various REIT sectors and their characteristics. In terms of the nature of our business, we believe that Iron Mountain is most like the self-storage but with an important difference. We are enterprise storage serving 94% of the Fortune 1,000 as opposed to consumer self-storage, which has a very different credit profile. In terms of other characteristics of the business, I think we believe we compare favorably with an attractive cash flow characteristics, low volatility and low risk. For example, in terms of cash flow, we have a much higher annual rental revenue per square foot, roughly 2x that of the self-storage sector, where we're approximately $27 a square foot versus $13 to $14 for self-storage. We also have similar low maintenance CapEx to self-storage at roughly 6% of our storage rental gross profit, and we have similarly low tenant improvements required when a new customer moves in. If we look at it in terms of volatility and comparing ourselves to the self-storage market, we have a very stable storage rental growth of plus 4% to plus 7% versus self-storage, which is ranged anywhere from minus 5% to plus 9% over the past several years. We also have very high customer retention rates of 98% compared with only about 55% of self-storage customers who stay more than one year. On top of that, the average life of a box in our storage rental business, as most of you know, is about 15 years. In terms of the risk profile of Iron Mountain's business versus the self-storage business, we have a very high-quality, diversified customer base serving 94% of the Fortune 1,000 and we have more than 155,000 customers globally, whereas self-storage has retail or individual consumers as customers with variable credit quality. So we look forward bringing you the specifics of these and other metrics, as well as our thoughts on Iron Mountain's valuation as a REIT, over the coming quarters. In summary, we are executing against our business strategy and are well positioned to deliver against our financial objectives in 2013. Our storage rental business is strong. We have meaningful growth opportunities available to us to extend the durable storage annuity, and we are making good progress towards delivering the REIT. Before I turn it over to Brian, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Richard Reese for his innumerable contributions to Iron Mountain. Many of you have come to know his candid and thoughtful style, and I believe the culture of the company is due to his influence and leadership over the past 30 years. As we met with investors over the past month, many of you expressed your thanks to Richard for his stewardship of the company and his willingness to return during a difficult phase in the company's history. He will be missed, and I have truly appreciated his insights in the short time that I've gotten to work with him here. I know you'll all join me in thanking him and wishing him well. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Brian.
Brian P. McKeon: Thanks, Bill. Let's turn to Slide 3, which highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered solid operating performance in Q4, driven by consistent storage rental growth. Storage rental grew 5% on a constant dollar basis in the quarter, supported by consistent gains in North America and 12% growth in International, including benefits from our 2012 acquisitions in Brazil and Europe. Overall, growth trends were similar, with reported results constrained by lower service revenues. As expected, we saw about $3 million of negative impact from lower year-on-year recycled paper pricing, however, the impact was less than we've seen in recent quarters, and we've worked through the lapping of the significant price declines that began in Q4 2011. Adjusted OIBDA was in line with our full year guidance. Our profit results continue to be supported by International margin gains. As reviewed in our Q3 call, we saw impacts in Q4 from costs associated with accelerated facility transactions and a realignment within our sales and account management organizations, as well as from the true-up of accruals at year end. Overall, we finished the year on track with our expectations, supported by solid storage growth, strong International gains and continued efficiencies in capital investment. Today, we are reiterating our full year 2013 financial outlook for revenues, adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow. We're increasing our CapEx guidance to reflect the recent facility lease buyout and the relocation of our Boston headquarters that was announced after Investor Day. Additionally, we're updating our preliminary outlook for our REIT conversion costs to reflect a more informed view of the expenditures required to complete the project, particularly with respect to the International convergence. We're investing to ensure that we meet the January 1, 2014 deadline, including having our REIT-critical systems operating in third quarter of this year. Let's move on to Slide 4 to review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the fourth quarter of 2011. As noted, Q4 results were as expected, supported by 5% constant dollar storage rental growth. Enterprise revenues grew 2% on a constant dollar basis as our International segment continued to drive strong performance. International posted 10% constant dollar revenue growth, supported by 4% internal growth and benefits from our acquisitions in Brazil and Switzerland. North America posted flat constant currency revenue growth as a lower service revenues offset 2% storage rental gains. Foreign exchanges had a minimal impact in the quarter. Gross profit was $420 million in Q4, yielding a gross margin of 55.4%, down 210 basis points compared to the same prior year period. Storage gross margin decreased 120 basis points, reflecting costs related to accelerated facility transactions in the U.K. and in the Southeastern United States. And service gross margins were down year-over-year due to decreased recycled paper prices and impact from lower core service activities. Mixed impacts from 2012 acquisitions were also a contributing factor. Adjusted OIBDA was $207 million or 27.2% of revenues in Q4. Our underlying profit performance remained solid, supported by continued improvement in our International segment. In Q4, this improvement was offset by the negative impacts from the costs associated with the facility transactions I just described, the realignment within the sales and account management teams in North America, the integration of our 2012 acquisitions and the impact of year-end cost accrual true-ups. Lower paper prices and lower service activity were also contributing factors to year-on-year decline in adjusted OIBDA. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.20 per share compared to $0.33 in Q4 2011. The decrease was primarily related to lower adjusted OIBDA and increased interest expense related to our recent debt financing transactions in support of shareholder payouts and the REIT conversion. Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS exclude the impact of costs associated with the REIT conversion. These costs reduced 2012 reported EPS by $0.07 per share. Reported earnings per share of $0.15 includes $18 million of REIT costs, $6 million of losses in asset dispositions and $2 million of other expense. These impacts were partially offset by the impact of a lower effective tax rate due to foreign currency losses and discrete tax items. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 40%. Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows the components building to our overall revenue growth. Q4 and full year growth rates were in line with our full year expectations. For the quarter, constant dollar growth was solid at 2.5%. Overall, constant dollar growth for the year was at the midpoint of our 0% to 2% range, including the impact of lower paper prices. Excluding these effects, constant dollar growth for the year was a solid 2%. In Q4, storage rental grew 5%, driven by consistent performance in North America and continued strong growth in our International segment. North America reported 2.4% constant dollar storage rental growth, reflecting relatively flat Records Management volume and consistent pricing trends in the 1.5% to 2% range, with some additional benefit from solid data protection storage rental growth. International storage rental constant dollar growth was 12% for the quarter, reflecting sustained double-digit growth in Latin America and Asia-Pac and benefits from the 2012 acquisitions. Total services decreased 1% as expected headwinds in North American activity-based services and lower paper prices more than offset solid DMS growth and benefits from our 2012 acquisitions. Overall, North America service revenues declined 4% in the quarter, with 1% of that decline related to paper. Gains in DMS revenues were offset by decreased core service activity levels and lower revenues from special projects and ancillary service lines, including film and sound and fulfillment services. The International segment posted 8% service growth supported by acquisitions. In terms of components building to overall growth, storage rental internal growth at 3.2% for the quarter showed an improvement, as expected, compared to Q3. Net global Records Management volume was up 1.8% on a year-on-year basis. Service internal growth was minus 2%, and total revenue internal growth was roughly 1%. Acquisitions and foreign exchange changes combined to add about 1.5 points to our reported results -- growth results. Overall, our storage rental business remains durable, providing consistent results and a solid foundation for our overall revenue performance. Let's take a look at our storage rental performance over the last 12 quarters on Slide 6. Slide 6 shows our constant dollar storage rental growth over the past 4 quarters to the enterprise, as well as for our 2 operating segments. The stability and durability of our storage rental business drives the economics of our business. We've now reported 24 consecutive years of storage rental growth. As you can see in this chart, since 2009, our constant dollar enterprise storage rental growth has averaged 4% per the quarter while ranging between 2.5% and 5%. North America, which generates approximately 75% of our storage rental revenues, continues to deliver stable growth of 2%. Our strategy here is to sustain this level of growth by capturing opportunities in the unvended market and underserved verticals such as government. As we outlined at Investor Day, our target growth rate for North America storage rental is between 1% and 3%. Our overall storage rental growth is enhanced by our fast-growing International segment, which has averaged 9% constant dollar growth over the past 3 years. This performance is supported by strong organic growth and more recently, additional growth through acquisitions. In the more developed International markets, we'll continue to support the growth of the annuity as we are in North America. In addition, we'll look to expand in high-quality, high-growth emerging segments. Over the next 3 years, we expect to drive 5% to 9% storage rental growth overall in International. Our long-term focus is to sustain the durability of our storage rental business as the key driver of our overall economics and the foundation for the long-term growth of our cash flows. Let's now take a look at our full year profit results in Slide 7. Slide 7 looks at our full year performance compared -- for 2012 compared to 2011. In terms of our key financial metrics, we delivered results that reflect consistent business trends and the achievement of our financial goals. Reported revenue for the year was $3 billion, up 1% on a constant dollar basis, as solid storage gains offset impacts from lower recycled paper prices and declines in core service activity in developed markets. Adjusted OIBDA was down 3% year-on-year on a constant dollar basis. Lower paper prices pressured profits by about $30 million in 2012. As noted, at current prices, we worked through these tough comparisons. Year-on-year results were also impacted by discrete costs in Q4, including facility moves, costs associated with the realignment of our sales and marketing organization and the year-end true-up of accruals. These impacts offset gains driven by strong underlying International profit performance. Adjusted EPS was $1.21 per share, down 11% compared to 2011, reflecting lower adjusted OIBDA and higher interest expense incurred to support shareholder payouts and costs associated with the planned reconversion, which more than offset the benefits from fewer weighted average shares outstanding for the full year. 2012 capital spending was $182 million, including $54 million of acquired real estate and $13 million of REIT conversion CapEx. As a percentage of revenues, CapEx excluding real estate and REIT CapEx is 6.1%, in line with our capital efficiency goals. Free cash flow for the year was $347 million, solidly within our guidance range, compared to $467 million for 2011. The year-on-year decrease was as expected, reflecting lower adjusted OIBDA combined with higher cash taxes compared to low 2011 levels, higher interest expense in support of our shareholder payout program and a lapping of lower cash incentive compensation payments in 2011. The 2012 adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS results shown here exclude $34 million of costs associated with the REIT conversion. These costs reduced 2012 reported EPS by about $0.14. Note that 2011 adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS excluded $16 million of these costs and reduced reported EPS by about $0.05 per share. In addition to the $30 million of REIT-related CapEx I just discussed, we paid $80 million in taxes towards our D&A recapture liability. All told, these items would have reduced free cash flow by about $116 million year-to-date. We've included a slide outlining the actual and expected REIT costs and related expenditures in the appendix of this presentation. Let's now turn to Slide 8 to review our full year results by segment. Slide 8 shows key year-to-date metrics for each of our 3 segments compared to 2011. Consistent with our business strategy, we're sustaining high returns in our North America segment while continuing to build momentum in our International segment as a significant driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. For the full year, our North American business segment reported revenues at $2.2 billion, supported by consistent 2% constant dollar storage rental gains. Despite the impacts of lower recycled paper prices, we sustained adjusted OIBDA margins of 42%. Adjusted OIBDA in North America was down year-on-year due to a decrease in paper revenues of $23 million, lower core service activity levels and costs associated with the facility transaction and the realignment in the sales and marketing organizations. We also sustained capital efficiencies in North America this year, spending at 4.5% of revenues excluding real estate. Our International segment continues to post strong constant dollar revenues, adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. Adjusted OIBDA increased 10% on a constant dollar basis. We're benefiting from cost improvement initiatives in Western European markets and strong profit performance in Asia-Pac. Excluding acquisition integration costs and the accelerated facility transactions in the U.K., International adjusted OIBDA margins expanded about 150 basis points this year. Benefits from productivity initiatives and from continued solid growth across our International portfolio have us on track towards our business goals of approximately 25% margins in 2013. Finally, corporate expenses were consistent with prior year levels, reflecting benefits from overhead cost control initiatives. Overall, we continue to drive strong operating performance across our portfolio. Let's now take a look at our debt statistics on Slide 9. Strong, consistent cash flow generation enables us to maintain a sound balance sheet. We're currently operating with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.9x, within our targeted 3x to 4x leverage range. Our leverage ratio was increased over the past 2 years as planned to support shareholder payouts of $1.5 billion and expenditures in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT over that period. As we've previously stated, the costs associated with REIT conversion, including tax payments, will temporarily and modestly push our leverage over the high end of our range -- of our target range. We're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At year end, liquidity was more than $900 million, with $243 million in cash and $667 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our strong cash flow supported continued advancement of our shareholder payout strategy. During the fourth quarter, we paid $47 million in regular quarterly cash dividends at a rate of $0.27 per share in addition to the $140 million cash portion of our $700 million special dividend. For the stock portion of this special dividend, we issued 17 million new shares. As we discussed on the Q3 call, management recommended and the board, at its regular scheduled meeting in December, agreed to maintain the $0.27 per share quarterly cash dividend rate rather than reduce it based on the new higher number of shares outstanding. This resulted in an increase to our dividend payout levels of nearly 10% over prior years. We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy while advancing substantial payouts to shareholders, and we're well positioned to fund our business plan. That concludes our review of our Q4 2012 results. Overall, 2012 was another good year in which we continued to drive solid financial performance and position ourselves well for continued success in 2013 and beyond. Let's now turn to Slide 10 to review our 2013 outlook. Today, we're reiterating our full year 2013 revenue, adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow guidance while updating our outlook for CapEx, adjusted OIBDA and REIT costs. As we first presented at Investor Day last October, we're projecting 2013 reported revenues to be in the range of $3,020,000,000 to $3,100,000,000 or 0% to 3% constant dollar growth. We're maintaining our outlook for adjusted OIBDA to be between $905 million and $935 million on an operating basis. Storage rental growth is expected to remain strong at 4% on a constant dollar basis, consistent with the past 2 years. Service revenue growth is expected to be down moderately, driven by consistent trends in developed markets. Based on current prices, recycled paper should have a limited impact on 2013 growth. Adjusted EPS for 2013 is now expected to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.24. The change from Investor Day is primarily due to some additional D&A and interest expense, as well as to formally update for the full number -- for the number of diluted shares outstanding that we have after the E&P distribution. We provided some estimates at Investor Day, and this formally builds in the actual 17 million shares distributed. The calculation of adjusted EPS now assumes 190 million shares outstanding and a structural tax rate of 39%. We're increasing our full year capital expenditures to be approximately $290 million, including an estimated $75 million for real estate. The increase reflects the addition of $22 million for the relocation of our Boston headquarters that was announced in Q4, as well as about $11 million for the buyout of a lease in Dallas we completed earlier this year. The $75 million we expect to spend on real estate this year includes $30 million for the expansion of our data center capacity in our Pennsylvania underground facility that we discussed at Investor Day. Our outlook for operating free cash flow continues to be in the range of $320 million to $360 million as we expect cash tax efficiencies that will offset the net cash impact from the office move. As we've been highlighting, we anticipate significant onetime operating and capital costs associated with our potential conversion to a REIT. These costs relates to substantial system investments, legal and tax work, advisory fees and other miscellaneous costs to implement the proposed structure. Total operating expense and capital costs are now estimated to be in the $150 million to $200 million range, up about $50 million from earlier estimates. We expect the majority of these costs to be incurred in 2013. We've increased our preliminary outlook in this area to reflect a more informed analysis of the conversion project, particularly with respect to the scope and timing of our international conversions. We're investing to ensure that we meet the January 1, 2014 deadline, including having our REIT-critical systems operating on a test basis by the third quarter of this year. For 2013, we expect to incur between $65 million and $90 million of incremental expense, between $30 million and $45 million of CapEx and to pay $105 million to $115 million in additional taxes related to the depreciation recapture, all in connection with the REIT conversion. The impact of these items will be a reduction in reported EPS of $0.26 to $0.36 and use of cash of $185 million to $230 million. We'll continue to track and report these costs discretely from our underlying operating results. Slides laying out our outlook for line items below adjusted OIBDA as well as for the REIT-related items are included in our appendix. That concludes our review. And in summary, Q4 was a quarter of good financial performance, and we're well positioned to achieve our financial goals in 2013. We continue to execute against our business plans, sustaining high profits and cash flow in North America and driving strong growth and higher returns in our International business. And we continue to advance work in connection with the proposed REIT conversion as part of our long-term approach to enhance value creation for stockholders. Thanks, and we'd now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Congratulations to Richard, Bill and Melissa. I wonder, Brian, just as we think about the uptick in the taxes related to the REIT, the $105 million to $115 million, up from $80 million, what was the reason for that in terms of -- was it just a tighter discussions with the IRS or just any thoughts around that?
Stephen P. Golden: Kevin, this is Stephen. No, this is just a schedule of payments over the course of time. There were -- there's more than one layer to it, and there's a small second layer coming in, in 2013 that wasn't there in 2012. So this has got nothing to do with conversations with the IRS. This is all fixed payments that just happened to be in bulk in 2013.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Got it. And then, Bill, it sounded like you've had a wonderful transition so far. One thing you mentioned were potential adjacencies. Was that kind of primarily related to data storage or anything else in addition to kind of the traditional services past data storage? And would you do that organically or inorganically?
William L. Meaney: I think -- right, and the only thing that we've come out public on is the wholesale data center as a potential area for adjacencies, but so there's a number of things that we're looking at that are across all those spectrums. But I think the way to think about it is the things we're looking at is similar to when we went into the tape business. So in 1995, I think, roughly, is when we really got going in the tape business, and it was less than a $15 million business. And today, we've turned this into a $400 million, $500 million business. So I think that the question for us is what is the next natural adjacency, just like we added tape alongside the box, which has been excellent. And there's a number of things we're looking at, and the one that we've highlighted or come a little bit more public about is the wholesale data center is a potential area.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Samford of Citigroup.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I just wanted to ask you quickly on the REIT conversion and where we are in terms of the next stage of E&P distribution. Is that -- and timing or any size as far as anything that you guys have come up with so far this year?
Brian P. McKeon: James, this is Brian. What I tried to say on that, the next E&P distribution, assuming we're successful with the feedback from the PLR, which we don't have anything new to announce on that front, but assuming we're successful, it would be in 2014. So we're not anticipating a E&P distribution beyond the one that we did at the end of last year until 2014. And that's consistent with normal timing on these types of things, we have until the end of 2014 to do the formal distributions as part of the conversion process.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the tape backup and data protection segment. What's the overall mix today? I think you said $400 million to $500 million -- $450 million to $500 million. And is that segment growing, or any metrics on either growth or margin expectations on that part of the business?
Brian P. McKeon: It's -- again, it's Brian. It is growing. We highlighted that actually, North America gave us some accretive benefit to the overall growth rate. You see somewhat similar dynamics in the tape business that you do to box in the sense that the archival use of tape continues to grow, and so the storage side of the business is solid. We're also getting the benefit of a refocus within the company over the last couple of years, really post the divestiture of the digital business. So a lot of the resources that were -- sales resources that were calling on CIOs were selling a broader spectrum of products, and now they're really laser-focused on the tape business, and we're starting to see the benefit of that flowing through our growth rate. We are seeing headwinds in the tape business like we are in box in the sense of activity-based service. There's less tape rotation going on. It's more archival in nature, and so there are some headwinds there that constrain the overall growth. But it's quite a healthy business. And I think a key thing to highlight there is it is very much aligned with the growth in digital data, right? The tape is a storage format for digital information, so it benefits from the explosion and growth of digital data. So it's a very good business, very nice returns for us, and we're pleased with the progress we're making there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of Barclays Capital.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess, the first question, can you just quantify, Brian, for us the costs related to the facility closures and how quickly do you get a return in terms of efficiency or savings going forward from those efforts? And secondly, just the rest of the other incremental. I think you said some accruals in incremental sales investments.
Brian P. McKeon: Yes, the facility transactions, there were 2 large ones. One was in London. It's basically closing one facility and consolidating into another. And we had one in Nashville, Tennessee in the U.S. And we'll see returns from those quickly, so those are basically payments we're making to get out of lease facilities and some other costs. And we'll consolidate it to other buildings, and so that's factored into our 2013 outlook. It's very quick payback. We do this all the time, so this is nothing new. We had some -- the other impacts in the quarter, the sales and marketing realignment was about $4 million. We highlighted paper being an issue year-on-year, about $3 million. And there were just a variety of things that kind of all went in one direction on the year-end accruals. We had some litigation accruals. We're still incurring some costs to finalize resolution of the government contract matter, which is progressing well, but there's a lot of money being spent there just to resolve that. We had some adjustments to stock programs. We moved to a world where we're paying a lot more in dividend, so we made adjustments to how that impacts the stock incentive programs for employees. We could basically give them credit for dividends in the future, and just some other normal noise. But those -- some total were several million dollars of impact. So a lot of noise in the quarter. When you cut through it, it was -- we expected a bunch of this, and so it's right in line with our guidance. And operationally, we feel good about the underlying performance. The International business is on track, good profit improvement in North America, sustained margins. We have endured some of the paper price swings, but we've worked through that. So we feel like we're in a good position to deliver the objectives that we outlined at Investor Day.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And I'm sorry, how much specifically was the cost of those 2 facility closure charges?
William L. Meaney: $7 million, $7 million combined.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, all right. And then a little more color on the sales. I know there's been talk of investments in sales beginning a year ago or so. Is this incremental on top of that in terms of a bit different strategy, or is this just continuing to execute what you've been working on for a while? And is it -- do you have any tangible sense yet how the verticalization, if that's a word, is actually working?
William L. Meaney: It's Bill. I think that it's early days, but what we did before is we did a very strong focus in verticalization around the health care segment, and based on that, we were able to see -- we were getting some good traction in gains against the headwinds that we were experiencing in health care with the drop in service revenues as people go into the electronic records. We saw that actually really worked to have people, to have sales teams that were specialized around certain vertical sectors. So what we've done at the start of this year is we've launched a number of different sectors, which I mentioned, including government, oil and gas, financial services, and doing exactly the same thing. So it's early days, but it was based on the success that we had in health care in terms of rejuvenating that business. We thought that this really is the thing that makes sense, to try to go after some of that unvended business and get more, especially in the mature markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Tong of Piper Jaffray.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Bill, could you talk a bit about the customer traction you're seeing with wholesale data centers, how much this contributed to 4Q results and how much you're expecting this to contribute going forward?
William L. Meaney: Well, I think that we're approaching a run rate of $20 million for 2013, and we have a number of clients or customers that mainly came to us that we're hosting in that wholesale data center. So we're in the process, as part of this realignment of the sales force is to actually be more proactive in terms of bringing in additional revenue, and that's where the investment that Brian highlighted, the $30 million that we're budgeting this year to expand that is based on sales volume. So we're not going -- we're not spending that money, hoping that people come. It is based on our expectations in terms of generating additional customers for that facility, and that's the amount that we've budgeted to actually build up a facility to serve them. So right now, it's early in the year, but we're sticking by our guidance that we're -- that's what we expect based on the pipeline that we're building.
Brian P. McKeon: And George, it wasn't a major driver of our economics in Q4, and in 2013, we're investing in the front-end capability to continue to build out this business, which we think could be a couple hundred million dollar business over time. And so you'll start to see the benefits of that flowing through more in 2014 in terms of the profit results, but right now, it's not a major driver of our profit growth. But we feel very good about the investments we're making. The incremental returns on this are very attractive. It's a great space and good execution and high end customer interest. So we feel very good about this, and I think to Bill's point, it's a business that we can meter quite well. We basically invest capital after we've got commitments and long-term contracts, so it's a good business all around to invest behind.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Got it. That's very helpful. As a follow-up, could you give us some color on what kind of customer activity you're seeing in the health care space, particularly with regard to the computerization of health records?
William L. Meaney: I think that, first of all, with the computerization of health care records, we're getting a lot less service revenue, which, I think, goes without saying. So it's becoming much more archival. So they're still retaining the paper records because they need that proof, but in terms of the access to the information on those records, that's being much -- more and more, that's being scanned, which is helping our scanning business. And it's -- then once it's electronic, they don't need to bring the records back and forth. Where we're were finding some new storage opportunities are things that -- which I discussed with some of you, for instance, in the pathology segment, and it's been an area that's been overlooked by a lot of the health care providers in the sense that they just stacked up these paraffin slides everywhere and also in terms of some of the tissue samples. And that's a business that we're seeing some decent growth, which is pure storage but needs to be stored under special environmental conditions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Brian, I know we're increasingly talking about constant currency growth, but I appreciate the reference back to internal growth. So when we look to 0% to 3% constant currency -- constant dollar growth for 2013, I wanted also a conversion back to organic growth. Is there any acquisition that have occurred since Analyst Day? Is FX still a very modest change, and so is internal growth going to be close to 0% to 3%? And the second question is within that 0% to 3%, how should core service fair?
Brian P. McKeon: Yes, so breaking that down a bit for you, if you're just looking at internal, Andrew, is we expect storage to be about 3%, so consistent with where we are. And services to be down modestly, so it's sort of a -- the flat to minus 2% range, I think, would be a good estimate there. And that is basically reflecting the activity base pressures we've talked about in more developed markets. In the emerging markets, we're internationally seeing very good service growth, but still a significant part of our business is U.S. and U.K. So that's the breakdown. Right now, we've got about 1 point of growth in our outlook related to acquisitions, and that just reflects what we've completed today, right? So if we do more, there will obviously be some accretion to that, but that's our current outlook.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And FX?
Brian P. McKeon: FX, limited impact at this point.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. And also, when you said 3% for storage and 0% to 2% for services, is that constant dollar or is that internal -- 0% to minus 2%, I'm sorry.
Brian P. McKeon: I was referring to internal.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I just want to follow up on Gary's question in terms of the onetime-ish type cost that came out in the quarter. You talked about facility costs and the SG&A realignment. Can you just give us the dollar amount? If I kind of onetime those things, I can pull them out and see what the underlying margin is for both North America and International?
Brian P. McKeon: So I walked through some of the details with Gary. The latter part of your question, Shlomo, I just wanted to clarify it. You're trying to understand what was International versus U.S.?
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Yes. And just a total dollar number. In other words, is it, I think you said $7 million for facilities and then $4 million for the realignment. Is the total onetime-ish type cost $11 million? And how are they split? I just want to confirm that and then see how they're split.
Brian P. McKeon: Right. In addition to that, you had year-end accrual impacts, which are in the range of $10 million, actually. Yes, in terms of if you sum total all of the impacts. So we had a fair amount of year-end accrual activity as well. Keep in mind that you have the paper year-on-year headwind of about $3 million as well. So combined, that was the key drivers of the performance. I don't have the breakdown between North America and International in front of me. I'm sure we can follow up on that for you. We did try to normalize the International margin growth, so I'm sure you can do the math on them.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And then just going forward for 2013, it looks like kind of an $8 million OIBDA improvement in margin to go down about 30 basis points. Is there going to be a continued improvement, should we think, in the future, that OIBDA should continue to gradually go up? And is the margin going down because you're getting better growth on International? Is that the way we should think of it?
Brian P. McKeon: We highlighted at Investor Day that we are advancing some new business investments in 2013, areas like wholesale data center that we talked about. We've got some other areas in beta in terms of new services around our tape business and highlighted there's about $10 million of investment there. That is -- our underlying outlook for the business reflects sustaining North America returns and following through on the margin improvement that we have in International and then having moderate margin improvement post 2013. So really, what you're seeing is just a reflection of -- we are making some select new business investments in 2013, and that's mitigating some of the benefits from the International margin gains.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And the second -- this is the second quarter, I think, you guys have said that the storage volumes in the U.S. are relatively flat. Do you they fall into the relatively flat negative territory or relatively flat positive territory? I'm just trying to figure out, is there any trend to be seen over there at all?
Brian P. McKeon: They were down 30 basis points year-on-year in North America.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Final question. What's the Plan B if PLR doesn't come back favorable?
Brian P. McKeon: We'll share more specifics with that if that's the case, but we would -- our business strategy doesn't change. We're committed to growing the business and in improving our operations, as we've talked about it, and returning capital to shareholders. The REIT was a better way to do that and aligned with how we're managing the business. We'll bring some more specifics around that, but you should anticipate us just bringing clarity on how we intend to return capitals to shareholders in the context of our business strategy going forward, but we don't have anything specific to share with you today.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann of Robert W. Baird.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So I just wanted to get your thoughts, Brian, since you've been kind of leading the REIT conversion process. Is there anything to be read from the Correction Corp.'s and GEO Group approval process? Is there anything, kind of takeaway, that those offer maybe confidence or less confidence in your conversion process?
William L. Meaney: Yes, I think they're all independent events. We don't have any insight into the dynamics in those discussions. I mean, we have our own set of facts and our own kind of proposals with the IRS, so I can't offer any insight from what's going on with others. I mean, clearly, there are more companies looking at this area, and so I think this is an area that's getting a lot of attention in terms of review. And that's -- there are other companies that are kind of nontraditional, if you will, in terms of proposing REIT structures, but our facts and circumstances are discrete and distinct, and I wouldn't read anything from other discussions into our situation.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Got it. On the government opportunity, as I think back about how you guys have talked about the government records and that they are -- they outsource but internally. They have their own kind of document management facilities, something that has been a long-term opportunity, but probably one of the most difficult opportunities that you guys have had going after. As you re-verticalize here, are there any green shoots of success in capturing that government business? And I think in the context of austerity and fiscal cliff, maybe that's more relevant today. Is there anything to report there on early successes?
William L. Meaney: Yes, look, I think that the -- I would put it in a bucket with all our vertical visions, early days, but we are doubling down on that. And I think our view is net-net, if the government comes under tighter and tighter budget pressure, that's a net positive for us. We're in a lot of discussions at different -- coming out from different angles with different government agencies, including their own internal storage people, and they are full and running out of capital. So I think that there's -- the opportunity for us is growing, but it is an area where we're doubling down our efforts to see if we can get something to happen in 2013. It's early days, but we're optimistic. Otherwise, we wouldn't have focused on that as a separate vertical.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then maybe one final question. It's really just around the M&A environment. There's been a bit of activity here in the last year or so. I think you guys kind of forecasted that, that might be happening. Is there still more out there? And then with the balance sheet leverage at the high end and probably going over the high end of your range here with more of this conversion spend and what have you, does that keep you maybe a little bit more conservative in how you go after that M&A? Or do you feel, I mean, unconstrained by doing what you'd see as good deals?
Brian P. McKeon: We're comfortable with the strategy that we've outlined. The M&A activity that we're driving is within our core business, and the businesses that we buy, the activity that you saw, a fair amount in Q4, are smaller North American acquisitions. They tend to be highly accretive, bring very good profitability. And so actually, in terms of when you think about our leverage structure, where we've historically been kind of 3x to 4x EBITDA, when you get these businesses, they fund -- a significant amount of them fund themselves in terms of the incremental OIBDA. So we're comfortable with the acquisition kind of ranges that we've talked about. And within the kind of the normal band that we've been functioning within, I think we had an estimate of about $100 million a year in our longer-term estimates and quite comfortable we can manage that.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions.
William L. Meaney: Okay, well, just to wrap up, I think we delivered on our expectations for the 2012 financial performance. And looking forward to 2013, just to recap, we expect continued solid growth in the storage rental and further expansion into existing and new emerging markets on our International side. Sustained -- we don't see anything other than sustained high margins in North America and additional profit improvement, which we've already highlighted in the International business. And we'll continue to pursue these with a strong focus on prudent capital allocation, with an overarching goal for total returns and delivering sustainable value to our shareholders. So we want to thank you all for joining us today, and we really appreciate your support.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Christy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Iron Mountain's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Stephen Golden. Please go ahead, Sir.
Stephen P. Golden: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our 2012 third quarter earnings conference call. We're all hoping that those of you impacted by the recent impact of Sandy came through it safely, and we're glad you could join us today. Joining me this morning are Richard Reese, our Chairman and CEO, and Brian McKeon, our CFO, and after their prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everybody for joining us in New York a few weeks back for our Annual Investor Day event. We had a great turnout, and I think the day was a great success. Again, we truly appreciate your interest and your support. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2 of our presentation. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2012 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. Please note that we have updated the definitions of adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow to exclude certain costs and expenditures related to our 2011 proxy contest, the work of the strategic review Special Committee of our board and our proposed conversion to a REIT. With that, I'd like to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Richard Reese.
C. Richard Reese: Good morning, Stephen and thank you, everybody, and welcome to our call. I'd like to repeat Stephen's comments to those of you who may have suffered through Hurricane Sandy. It was a massive storm up on the East Coast. We have large operations, and quite a large facility footprint in that area. So we know what you all went through. I am happy to report that Iron Mountain did not suffer any significant facility damage and so forth from the hurricane, and we've weathered that storm quite well, given its impact around us and so forth. We are, however, having some operating challenges primarily related to local access. There are places where we still can't get into our facilities on a regular basis. We've been able to inspect and make sure things are fine, but it has mostly to do with control of local access, and I'm sure that will clear itself up in due course. We also, because of the impact on our customers, particularly in Manhattan, would expect to see some noise in our Q4 service revenues. There'll be some impact. It's a little early to quantify, but we don't expect it will impact storage or any of the real fundamentals of our business for the quarter. So I hope you all are well. We are busy making sure our customers are taken care of and, quite frankly, through our foundation, making sure any of our employees that are impacted are taken care of, and that's a key part of our agenda at the moment. Let's look back at the quarter. You'll see that we had good operating results, but we've had some noise or we call macro factors in our numbers. We are telling you and we do expect that for the full year, we'll be -- hit our full year targets. We think the business is running quite well, and we'll go through it. I would expect the call, frankly, to be relatively brief today, as we've just had our recent Investor Day. We appreciate the many of you that attended. We had a great turnout, and I think a good conversation, and we appreciate your feedback and your input and, hopefully, we did a good job of communicating to you where we are and where we're headed as a company. As I said, operating results for the quarter were on target and in line with our expectation. Reported revenues at $748 million were down 2.6% on a reported basis compared to last year, primarily driven by the impacts of lower paper prices and unfavorable FX. Lower recycled paper prices in our shredding business, as well as destroying records from our storage business reduced our overall revenue growth by 1.5 percentage points versus the same quarter. And this is the same trend we saw last quarter. Last quarter and this quarter, we're in our toughest comps. As you remember, we started to see recycled paper prices really come off hard coming into this year, but last year, they were at all-time highs. So you have sort of the 2 worst comparisons. This trend will get better with time on a comparison basis and in fact, will be some -- we think somewhat better in Q4, as we lap it, but going into next year, these issues should go away. FX reduced reported revenue growth rates by about 2%. The storage rental, which you all know, hopefully you did hear the message at ID and you've heard for years, is the key driver of our business, remained on track at 4% in constant dollar terms. North America's on track with their historical trends and International continued to generate solid strong double-digit growth. The annuity rental revenue stream that we value so highly remains durable, and still operates in the sort of 3% to 5% constant dollar range that we've been doing for some time. Service revenues continued its pattern, this quarter, was down 6%. Lower recycled paper prices drove more than half of that, which I just spoke about. The other weakness in routine services, the patterns remained consistent and there were no really changes in those trends. And in addition, we saw a little softness in Europe, primarily in the U.K., and primarily driven around the 2 back-to-back Olympics that they had there, and the congestion and traffic. And frankly, customer impact of them going solid for quite an extended period, and we have a large business there and we saw some impact from that. And again, all that should rebound fine. We sustained OIBDA -- adjusted OIBDA margins, despite the service headwinds and despite the lower paper prices -- and I should remind you that recycled paper is a 100% margin. So when it comes off as it did, it came off reasonably hard, holding margins for the whole company is a bit of a struggle, and it takes a lot of good execution. The team did a great job. We had programs in place, and we've been working quite a while consistently on corporate and divisional overhead, and we continue to execute those programs. And the team did well, and that's how we were able to make that happen. Plus, we were realizing and recording benefits from the International margin expansion program that we've been talking to you about. In fact, International is performing well and on track with their 3-year margin expansion goals. In Q4, we're going to actually allow them to -- since they've got -- their plans are working as they expect, and they've got extra execution capacity, we're going to accelerate some investments into Q4. Brian will give you a little more details related to facility consolidations to improve our facility network utilization and frankly, will derive future benefits, and we'll take an expense that we might have waited a while to take into the future and accelerate it into this quarter, take advantage of the execution opportunities and accelerate the realization of those benefits. The acquisitions, which were a key part of our International growth strategy, particularly in the emerging markets, are on track in terms of integration and so far, they're proceeding well and we're finding no surprises. International remains on track towards their roughly 25% margin target in 2013. So as I said, the business is running as we expected it would. We're still dealing with some extraneous noise factors in paper and FX, but the fundamentals of the business are running fine, and we're about executing the business and continue to drive it forward. At Investor Day, we discussed several themes, and I don't want to repeat 4, 5 hours of our discussion, but I'll give you just a brief discussion for those who weren't there, and make sure that you understand the things we really were talking about. And first is, is our focus on storage rental revenue, which is the driver of the business. And we store boxes of paper and tapes and a variety of other things and it's out of that, that drives the majority of the revenue, the majority of the gross margin and profits and free cash flow of the business. We derive that from a global real estate network that's substantial in size of over 64 million square feet of real estate, of which we own nearly 40%. We lease the balance. And it's nearly 1,000 -- 994 is we should say, properties spread across 32 countries. And as we've talked about at I-Day, one of the things we see as an advantage of and an offshoot of, assuming a successful REIT conversion, that we have an opportunity to leverage our cost of capital and financing to really reorient, slowly, our balance sheet over time to tune our weighted average cost of capital by the acquisition of a significant number -- additional number of these leased facilities, where we would change from a lease financing type of debt to a third-party type of debt in order to reduce our cost of debt. And that's one of the things we've talked about there as a benefit of moving forward towards a REIT. As you know, we decided to pursue a REIT structure after divesting our additional services business a couple of years ago, and we did that. But given our heavy real estate ownership and focus on storage, we felt, after a lot of analysis and a lot of deep work, that a REIT approach is something that, of course, we looked at before, but at this point in our strategy, we felt that it aligned with our business strategy. And part of that opportunity was getting out of the digital services business that sort of changed our perspective on the ability to make that work. And part of it was, that as we got out of the digital services business, we really refocused our business back on our core storage. And that focus had been lost for a while as we were chasing the digital business, and we're starting to see the advantages. It's a slow turn of a battleship. The business didn't go negative. It just didn't grow as well as it could have, and we're starting to see that battleship's turning, and we think the business has got a good solid future, and we'll continue to grow it and continue to evolve a very strong, high cash-generating storage business. And therefore, the REIT approach aligns with this real estate driven business and aligns with the capital allocation strategy that we set forth, which is invest and enhance the long durability, the long-term durability of the storage business, but also to return excess free cash flow or excess capital back to our shareholders. And we've shifted our strategy in that vein. You've seen us increase our normal dividend flow, and our dividend flow over time. And of course, the REIT structure is a more disciplined approach that requires more discipline. Nothing comes for free and nothing comes easy. But requires more discipline in distribution of cash to the shareholders, result in a much higher dividend rate, result in certain other requirements to pay those dividends in that nothing comes free. But as we looked at our business plan and we looked at the capital allocation strategy and we looked at our models for the future, we think we found a balanced approach and a way to make it work and be good for everybody. So we continue to pursue that strategy. As you know, and at our Investor Day or the morning of our Investor Day on October 11, we announced an E&P distribution. That is a pre-requisite requirement for becoming a REIT, but I want to stress that -- the fact that we announced that E&P distribution early -- first, it's something we told you some time ago we plan to do, and second, is not any indication that we have any information about the probability of success of being -- getting a private letter ruling from the IRS. We're not giving any signals whatsoever, except that we're following through on our commitment that we have made some time ago, and that commitment was founded in the basic capital allocation strategy we put forth. And we had told you that we were going to dividend out or buy in stock, and distribute a significant amount of our excess capital. And we feel like that doing the E&P distribution, although it is in the path of becoming a REIT and a requirement of becoming a REIT, it also fits in with our capital allocation strategy. So even if we're not successful, as we told you before, we would go forward with that distribution, and we are in the process of doing that. There have been some questions of people about the mechanics. So I want to go through it with you a little bit because you have a choice or a decision to make, and absent a decision, the default position, and I just want to make sure everybody understands what your options are. The distribution we announced was $700 million to be distributed on November 21. The record date was October 22. This was designed and intended to be an ordinary and qualified dividend, and not intended to be a return of capital from a tax or accounting perspective. We intend to pay 80% of it in stock and 20% in cash. And you, as our investors, have an election, and you should be looking out for mailings or notifications or whoever is controlling your securities, but you have to make an election to determine the ultimate split. So shareholders of record should have received that election materials by now. There's also an 8-K filed with the relevant information, and it's available on our website for the details. But a little bit about the election. You can choose to receive all cash or all stock. You can't choose a mix in between. So it's option a, all cash; option b, all stock. And the value of the shares to be distributed will be determined based on the closing prices of the 3 days following November 14. Investors who don't vote or don't get their votes in by 5 p.m. on November 14, by default, will receive all stock. Investors who choose stock will receive all stock. Investors who choose cash will receive a pro rata share of the available pool of cash, that is $140 million, based on the overall election results. So it's important if you want all stock, you don't have to do anything. If you want a pro rata amount of cash, you have to make an election that says all cash. We will complete the balance of the E&P -- well before I get to that, I hope everybody understands that you have to make a decision unless you want all stock. I think it boils down to that. So look out for the technicalities. Reach out to your brokers for the individuals involved in the call and so forth, and make sure that you make a conscious decision. Look at the 8-K. Look at our website. Make yourself an educated consumer here so -- as you make a conscious decision. After this, assuming we get a successful opinion and letter ruling from the IRS, and that is an assumption, we will complete the E&P -- an E&P distribution, but we have to distribute all of our E&P up through the end of 2013, sometime during 2014, assuming we're successful. There will not be an E&P distribution or there's not expected to be one in 2013. After 2014, there would likely be some additional small E&P distributions as we integrate more of our International operations into the QRS TRS structure of being a REIT, but they will be relatively small, and would come in over the next couple of years. So I hope that this clarifies any questions that would come around about what your choices are and your options are, and I hope that you understand the actions that you need to take. When we get to the Q&A in a little while, we'll obviously try to answer other questions if you have some. Another question we've been receiving is, since the E&P distribution, the stock portion effectively operates like a stock split, except that you do get high basis stock. And that is a position that I find many shareholders still have trouble wrapping their brain around. That high basis stock has an extreme value to you, and you can convert that anytime you want it to cash. But assuming that -- you know, on a share count basis, it operates like a split and that's the way the stock traded. The question we've come into is, will we hold our dividend rate -- our quarterly dividend that we've been distributing, will we hold the dividend rate the same or will we adjust it downward by -- because of the increased number of shares. And although we have not made -- the board has not voted, and it is their choice and their decision, on what the next quarterly dividend will be, and they will not do that until our regularly scheduled meeting in December, management expects to recommended that the board maintain the current dividend on a per share basis. Assuming that the board adopts management's position, this would amount to an increase of nearly 10% in the dividend payout, the amount of cash being paid out, over our current levels, and given the issuance of that much more new shares. This is all in keeping with our capital allocation policy. We've been very clear and that policy's in place, REIT or no REIT. And we're continuing to move down that path and frankly, we're in a dual path here of pursuing a REIT and trying to be successful there. But if we're not successful there, we're on a path of distributing a significant amount of free cash flow to our shareholders. And either way, we will make that work. So that's where we are. A good operated quarter, not a lot to talk about. Be happy to take your questions in a minute. Let me turn it over to Brian, and then we'll come back.
Brian P. McKeon: Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everyone. Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered solid operating performance in Q3 supported by durable storage rental growth. Our profit results are on track, and continue to be supported by International margin gains and benefits from overhead cost controls. Storage rental grew 3 -- grew 4% on a constant dollar basis in Q3, reflecting consistent gains in North America and 12% growth in International, including benefits from our recently completed acquisitions in Brazil and Europe. Overall business trends were consistent with continued impacts from pressure on activity-based services. Reported results were constrained, as expected, by significantly lower recycled paper prices and weakened foreign currencies. Recycled paper prices were down 37% year-on-year, reducing revenues and profits by $11 million in the quarter. The year-on-year impact of lower paper prices will lessen in Q4, as we begin to lap the sharp price decline that began in Q4 of 2011. Unfavorable FX changes reduced growth rates by about 2%. Excluding these macro factors, revenue and adjusted OIBDA grew 1% and 2%, respectively, on a constant dollar basis. Good performance in the quarter is keeping us on track to achieve our full year financial goals. As we head into the fourth quarter, we're narrowing our full year guidance ranges. We're reiterating our adjusted OIBDA midpoint. We're also pulling in the top end of our revenue range to reflect year-to-date performance and current FX and paper pricing levels. I'll speak more to these and other refinements to our year end outlook later in my remarks. Let's now turn to Slide 4, and review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the third quarter of 2011. As noted, Q3 results were constrained by recycled paper and FX impacts. Lower year-on-year paper pricing reduced revenue growth by 1.5% and adjusted OIBDA growth by 4.4%. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar reduced reported growth rates by an additional 2%. Excluding these impacts, our underlying operating performance was solid, reflecting consistent business trends. Enterprise revenue growth was flat on a constant dollar basis. C$ storage revenue growth of 4% was offset by a 6% C$ decline in service revenues, with about half of the service decline related to lower paper pricing. From a segment perspective, North America posted constant currency revenue growth of minus 3%. Storage rental grew 1.5% constant dollar but, as expected, these gains were offset by pressures on service revenues. Overall North American service revenues declined 9.5%, constant dollar, in the quarter. Excluding paper price changes, North American service growth was down 6%, constant dollar. Gains in DMS revenues were offset by decreased core service activity levels and lower revenues from fuel surcharges, shredding and fulfillment services. Our International segment posted 8% constant dollar revenue growth, supported by 12% storage rental growth. These results reflect sustained growth in Europe, continued double-digit gains in Latin America and Asia Pacific and benefits from our recently completed acquisitions in Brazil and Switzerland. These gains were augmented by strong DMS service and project revenues, which offset impacts from lower paper prices and lower revenues from shredding services and other activity-based services in some of our mature markets. Gross profit was $438 million in Q3, yielding a gross margin of 58.5%, down 160 basis points compared to the same prior-year period. Storage gross margins increased 110 basis points, reflecting lower occupancy costs and personal property taxes. Service gross margins were down year-over-year due to decreased recycled paper revenues and a mix shift away from higher margin core services towards relatively lower margin businesses, including DMS. The previously disclosed reclassification of certain overhead expenses to cost of sales was also a contributing factor. We continue to offset pressure from factors such as lower paper pricing to maintain strong adjusted OIBDA margins. Adjusted OIBDA was $244 million or 32.6% of revenues in Q3. Higher storage rental gross profits, strong performance in our International business and benefits from overhead cost initiatives offset negative impacts from lower paper prices and lower service activity. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.34 per share compared to $0.40 in Q3 of 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower adjusted OIBDA, higher DNA due to -- primarily to acquisitions and increased interest expense related to our recent debt financing transactions in support of shareholder payouts and the REIT conversion. These impacts more than offset the benefits of fewer shares outstanding following our substantial share repurchases in 2011. Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS exclude the impact of costs associated with the REIT conversion, Special Committee and prior-year proxy costs of $11 million in 2012 and $1 million in 2011. These costs reduced 2012 reported EPS by $0.04 per share. By definition, these items have been excluded from our calculations of adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Reported earnings per share of $0.31 includes $11 million of REIT costs, $8 million of other expense and the impact of a higher effective tax rate due to foreign currency losses and discrete tax items. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 41%. Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows the components building to our overall revenue growth. Q3 and year-to-date growth rates are trending in line with our full year expectations by major revenue type. In terms of C$ growth, storage rental remains on track towards our 4% full year C$ growth outlook. Overall C$ growth was down slightly in Q3, impacted by lower recycled paper pricing and continued pressures on activity-based services. As noted, we worked through our toughest comparisons on the recycled paper front, and we remain on track for full year C$ growth in the range of 0% to 2%. In terms of components building to overall growth, storage rental internal growth at 2.4% was in line with our expectations. The storage rental business remains durable and on track towards our full-year goals. Net global records management volume was up nearly 2% on a year-on-year basis in Q3. International storage rental growth was 5% -- storage internal revenue growth was 5% for the quarter, reflecting sustained double-digit growth in Latin America and Asia Pac. International storage rental growth moderated somewhat from very strong Q2 levels, reflecting recent softness in Europe. North America reported 1.5% internal storage rental growth, with consistent pricing trends in the 1.5% to 2% range. Overall, North America volume has remained relatively flat over the last several quarters. We saw a modest year-on-year decline in North American volume in Q3, as we were up against our toughest quarterly comparison, but we remain on track towards 2% storage rental growth and sustained volume this year. Storage service internal growth was minus 8% or down 5% excluding impacts from commodity changes. Core service internal growth was minus 4% in the quarter, as growth in DMS services was more than offset by lower fuel surcharges and shredding service revenues and expected decline in activity-based core services. Complementary service revenues, representing about 11% of total revenues, decreased 17% internally. Results were driven primarily by an $11 million decline in recycled paper revenues, similar to Q2. Paper prices have recently come off their summer highs, and are now at about $150 per ton. Assuming they remain stable for the balance of the year, the gap should narrow as we begin to lap the steep decline that started in Q4 of 2011. As noted, FX rate changes had a 2% negative impact, which pressured reported results. Let's now take a look at our year-to-date results on Slide 6. Slide 6 looks at our year-to-date 2012 performance compared to 2011. Our year-to-date performance reflects consistent business trends. Reported revenue of $2.2 billion is up 1% on a constant dollar basis, as continued solid storage gains offset impacts from lower recycled paper prices and soft core service activity. Lower paper prices and the SG&A re-class discussed previously have lead to a modest decline in gross margins. Despite these impacts, adjusted OIBDA is flat year-over-year on a constant dollar basis. Strong International profit performance and overhead cost initiatives are key factors in this improvement. We expect these factors to continue to support profit performance as we move forward. Adjusted EPS is $0.99 per share, down 2% year-to-date. Lower adjusted OIBDA, higher DNA and interest expense offset the benefits from fewer shares outstanding. 2012 capital spending is $114 million, excluding $23 million of acquired real estate and $3 million of REIT conversion CapEx. As a percent of revenues, CapEx, excluding real estate, is 5.1%, in line with prior year levels. Capital expenditures historically increase in the second half of the year. We remain on track to achieve our capital spending efficiency targets in 2012. Free cash flow through Q3 was $209 million compared to $315 million for the first 3 quarters of 2011. The decrease is due primarily to higher cash taxes compared to low 2011 levels, higher interest expense in support of our shareholder payout program, and the lapping of lower cash incentive compensation payments in 2011. We remain on track towards our full year free cash flow targets as well. The adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS here exclude year-to-date costs associated with the REIT conversion Special Committee and prior year proxy costs, which were $16 million in 2012 and $15 million in 2011. These year-to-date costs reduced 2012 reported EPS by $0.06. In addition to the $3 million of REIT-related CapEx I just discussed, we paid $36 million in taxes towards our DNA recapture liability. All told, these items would reduce free cash flow by about $49 million year-to-date. We've included a slide outlining the actual and expected REIT costs and related expenditures in the appendix to this presentation. Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review our results by segment. Slide 7 shows key year-to-date metrics for each of our 3 segments compared to the same period in 2011. Consistent with our business strategy, we're sustaining higher returns in our North American segment, while continuing to build momentum in our International segment as a significant driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. Year-to-date, our North American business segment reported revenues of $1.7 billion, supported by consistent 2% C$ storage rental gains. Despite the impacts of lower recycled paper prices, we sustained adjusted OIBDA margins of 42%. We're also sustaining capital efficiencies while spending at 4% of revenues, excluding real estate. Our International segment continues to post solid constant dollar revenue growth and strong adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. Adjusted OIBDA increased 14% on a C$ basis. We're benefiting from cost improvement initiatives in Western European markets and strong profit performance in Asia Pac. International adjusted OIBDA margins expanded 150 basis points. Benefits from productivity initiatives and from continued solid growth across our International portfolio has us on track towards our business plan goals of approximately 25% margins in 2013. As Richard mentioned, we're tracking to our International margin improvement plan, and we've decided to accelerate certain building moves in London. This would result in about $6 million of additional expense in Q4 that will drive future benefits and won't interfere with our 3-year margin expansion goals. Finally, corporate expenses declined 7% compared with prior year levels, reflecting benefits from overhead cost control initiatives. Overall, we continue to drive strong operating performance across our portfolio. Let's now take a look at our debt statistics on Slide 8. Strong consistent cash flow generation has enabled us to maintain a sound balance sheet. We're currently operating with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.6x, comfortably within our target at 3 to 4x leverage range. As we discussed at Investor Day, our leverage ratio will increase as we make shareholder payouts and expenditures in connection with the REIT conversion process. In anticipation of these cash outlays, we completed a very successful bond offering in August. We sold $1 billion of 5 3/4% bonds due in 2024. This was the lowest interest rate for a debt offering of our credit rating in the history of the high-yield market. We used the net proceeds to retire $320 million of 6 5/8% bonds and $200 million of 8 3/4% bonds and to pay down our line of credit. As a result, we're well-positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was $1.1 billion with $335 million in cash and $722 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our debt portfolio also remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate is down at 6.5%, and we're nearly 87% fixed at quarter end. Maturity is about 7.6 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. Our strong cash flows support continued advancement of our shareholder payout strategy. During the third quarter, we paid $46 million in regular quarterly dividends at a rate of $0.27 per share. As part of our planned conversion to a REIT, earlier this month, we announced that the first portion of our E&P purge will be paid out in November. We'll be distributing $700 million to our shareholders, using up to $140 million in cash and the balance in stock. This will result in our issuing about 17 million new shares based on current share prices. As Richard mentioned, management expects to recommend that the board, at its regularly scheduled meeting in December, maintain the $0.27 per share rate rather than reduce it based on the new higher numbers of share outstanding -- shares outstanding. This will result in an increase to our dividend payout levels of nearly 10% over current levels. We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our strategy, while advancing substantial payouts to shareholders, and we remain well-positioned to fund our business plan. That concludes our review of Q3 2012 results. Overall, we continue to drive solid financial performance, and we're on track to achieve our goals in 2012. Let's now turn to Slide 9 to review our 2012 full year outlook. Slide 9 summarizes our current 2012 operating outlook. Today, we're reiterating our midpoint projection for adjusted OIBDA, while tightening the range by $20 million. We're also lowering the top end of our revenue projections by $20 million to reflect year-to-date results and current FX and recycled paper levels. We're projecting 2012 reported revenues to be in the range of $2,990,000,000 to $3,020,000,000 or 1% to 3% C$ growth, excluding the impact of lower paper prices. We're maintaining our outlook for adjusted OIBDA, while narrowing the range to be between $900 million to $920 million on an operating basis. This outlook includes about $10 million of costs related to real estate transactions that will support increased network utilization. We also expect to incur severance costs related to select organizational changes in Q4. Adjusted EPS for 2012 is now expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.28. In addition to the narrowing of the adjusted OIBDA range, we've updated the adjusted EPS range to reflect increased interest due to our recent financing. The calculation of adjusted EPS assumes a 40% structural rate and 172 million shares outstanding. Assuming we issue about 17 million shares to pay for -- to pay a portion of the E&P purge, our weighted average shares outstanding for the full year will increase about 2 million shares and adjusted EPS will be reduced by about $0.01 per share. We now expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $245 million, including an estimated $50 million for real estate. As noted on Investor Day, the increase reflects a real estate lease buyout opportunity we're taking advantage of in North America. Our outlook for our operating free cash flow continues to be in the range of $320 million to $360 million. As highlighted in our announcement to pursue conversion to a REIT, we intend to pay significant one-time operating and capital costs associated with the conversion. Total operating expense and capital costs are estimated to be between $100 million to $150 million, with the majority deployed over the next 2 years. These costs relate to substantial system investments, legal and tax work, advisory fees and other miscellaneous costs to implement the proposed structure. The effort's underway, and we'll be breaking out and reporting on estimated impacts as we advance the process. For 2012, in addition to the operating expectations discussed above, we expect to incur between $25 million and $30 million of incremental expense, $10 million in CapEx, and to pay about $80 million in additional taxes related to the depreciation recapture in connection with the REIT conversion. The impact of these items will be a reduction in reported EPS of about $0.09 to $0.10 per share and a use of cash between $105 million and $108 million. As noted, the slides laying out our outlook for line items below adjusted OIBDA, as well as the related items, are included in the appendix. That concludes our review. In summary, Q3 was another quarter of good financial performance and we're on track to achieve our financial goals for 2012. We continue to execute against our 3-year plan, sustaining high profits and cash flow in North America, while driving stronger growth and higher returns in our International business, and we continue to advance work in connection with the REIT conversion as part of our long-term approach to enhance value for shareholders. Thanks, and we'd now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James Samford with Citigroup.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: The impact of Sandy, I believe you've said that some potential impact to services. Can you provide just a little bit of history on your geographic concentration in the tri-state area and the sort of prior natural disaster impacts that might have impacted your business.
C. Richard Reese: Oh, we have significant facilities in that area. I couldn't tell you how many off the top of my head on how many square feet, but it's significant. You can assume that Metro New York, New Jersey is one of our largest, if not, largest market geographically. Historically, we've had other natural disasters. We've been through a bunch. This one's a pretty big one, it looks like. It's a little early to tell the impact on customers. But you'll see a wiggle, what we'd call a wiggle in the revenue. Storage doesn't get impacted. It might get delayed by a week or 2 coming in, but that's not a significant impact. What happens is, is service will decline. Your transportation and retrieval/refile activity will decline. That type of service, I'm just trying to parse in my head real quick, is not a major part of our service line of revenue. So I would -- net-net, it's a few million dollars, I'm guessing right now, but it's not $100 million. It's not even $50 million. I bet it's not $10 million. It's a few million dollars that we'll see. But we kind of keep track of everything, so we just wanted to let you know that's happening. Just like the London Olympics. You can see the difference on a year-over-year comparison the thing's so steady.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And I guess, just a quick -- I assume your 2013 outlook is still sort of on track at this point, that you provided at Analyst Day?
C. Richard Reese: Yes, we just -- all this will be -- I don't like -- or I guess I do like to call it noise, I call it noise a lot. It's noise, but it just explains why things move a little bit here and there. But yes, we don't see any change in the trajectory of the business.
Brian P. McKeon: Yes, I'd just say on the service front, to Richard's point, it's early to tell. It will be more at the margin. I think, right now, we don't have a good sense of how long the delays might be in place, so that's...
C. Richard Reese: As we spoke, I just got an e-mail telling me that one of our high-activity facilities, New York, New Jersey area, we just got into it, as in to be able to be up and running, delivering services. We've been into it, but not been able to deliver services. So it looks like it's back online at these facilities. Now we'll have to wait and see whether our customers are online and so forth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Could you tell us what your outlook is in services demand, x paper prices, and when you might see a re-acceleration in the activity-based services and what might drive that?
C. Richard Reese: Well, I don't know that we -- well, there's 2 components to the activity-based services. One, the big driver down still is our healthcare business, which we have said constantly is a business that, frankly, slowly is going away. Not the business itself. It's changing its nature. It's becoming a much less active storage business. And so the activity, which that is our most activity vertical segment, is coming way off. The storage side of the business is growing nicely, but the activity side is coming off. That trend will continue slowly for quite a while, okay? And then you have activity clients related to just all data getting less active. That's also a slower -- that's also a slow trend. And then third, you have economic activity declines, and we talked a lot about this in Investor Day. It's hard to parse which percentage. I mean, we know what's going on in the healthcare, which is a big part of it. But add it all up, you're talking $15 million to $20 million headwind in terms of total services on an annual basis. And I think if we had good robust economies, and as we weed through some of this, that might come down by 1/3 or somewhere like that. That's a guess though. That's not a precise answer.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Right, got it. And you mentioned extra execution capability driving the accelerated investments in the fourth quarter. Could you provide additional details on where the investments are going and what benefits or returns you're expecting to realize from the investments?
Brian P. McKeon: Yes, so we'll have -- as I have noted, George, we've got about $10 million of real estate transactions in the fourth quarter. The biggest one is we're consolidating volume in London. We have excess capacity and we're going to close a facility. That's about a $6 million impact. We've got some investments in the U.S. as well. We're consolidating volume at an existing -- we have an existing lease facility that we're going to move out of and take a charge there. And we've got some investments going around just in terms of upgrading facilities as well. And net-net -- that's factored into our outlook. We're counting on that next year, but those will have benefits in terms of reduced rental costs going into next year. So I think Richard's point on the international front was the team's been executing extremely well. We feel very good about the -- getting to our 2013 goals and I think we've got some ability here to move things forward. Good return activity forward and faster, and we're going to take advantage of that.
C. Richard Reese: I mean, the team's basically, and we've done this before, they've come to us and they said, "Look, we -- our plans for this year are pretty cooked, and they're operating and the margins are flowing and so forth." And if we will relieve them on a reported basis from -- let them have some more expense in Q4 on a reported basis, they'll accelerate and get at more, and so those are good decisions, and so we said, "Sure, let's do it."
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. I want to just have just a follow-up on that question a little bit, and something that we talked about at Investor Day. But obviously is, you guys kind of cull through your portfolio of real estate and converting some leases to maybe purchase facilities, et cetera, and maybe some consolidation. How far are you through that process of really looking at that portfolio and how much value might there to be unlocked as kind of we go forward through that process?
Brian P. McKeon: Well, I think, we're -- to a degree, we've had a level of activity going on for a long time, right? Building consolidations are a normal part of what we do, and so that work continues. I think the opportunity we highlighted at Investor Day was we have basically a $2.5 billion universe in potential investment opportunity between buying out leases and investing. And the real estate and expansion markets, kind of a probability-based view on that. We put out an estimate of $1 billion deployment, perhaps, over a long period of time and...
C. Richard Reese: And buying in an existing lease facility is not to be confused with moving out and consolidating an inventory. They're really kind of separate transactions, okay? If we're consolidating inventory, we're typically either moving out of an owned building and selling the building or moving out of a lease and taking a charge because the present value of where we're going justifies that investment. Those are separate decisions. We would tend to buy-in buildings, buy-in leases, where we have high-quality buildings, good real estate, and where the cost of financing it in an acquired mode is cheaper than the cost of the lease that we have. And oftentimes, that occurs at a lease renewal cycle or when landlords want to get some liquidity out of their portfolio, and so on a negotiated basis.
Brian P. McKeon: So one way to look at is if we got $1 billion, you'd say the majority of that is lease buyouts. If we've got a cap rate of 8%, on average, on leases, if we can finance at a lower rate directly, that will be a net benefit to us. So that might give you a sense of kind of the net annualized benefit we could realize over time from the financing side of that. And we'll continue to increase our network utilization through other activities like building those, as Richard talking about.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then second question. We talked a little bit on the services in terms of some of the headwinds and also kind of the shredding services being down a little bit. Is competition getting a little bit hotter in that in terms of, at least, here in Chicago, we see some more competitors and some more trucks around? Is that a big concern or is that just on the periphery?
C. Richard Reese: Well, the competition is always a concern because of -- and sure, the shredding business has some large players and a lot, a lot, a lot of small players, and it's a reasonably easy-entry business for the small players. But our shredding services, the bend [ph] tips and the number stops and all the activities are up and continue to grow quite nicely, but what we're suffering is -- we're suffering 2 things: some price decline, which is competitive-market driven, but a lot driven off of a rollover of some very large enterprise accounts quite some years ago in a different market environment, and which we then are repricing themselves or getting repriced to current markets. But the big driver is the paper itself. I mean, the paper is a key driver of revenue and profitability in that business, and it's gone from an all-time high to not quite an all-time low, but a much lower number.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: [Audio Gap] growth, I know you said it was in line with expectations, but it was different than the second quarter rate. Could you just go over those differences again? You went through them quickly. And do you think that the fourth quarter storage growth will be similar to the third?
Brian P. McKeon: Andrew, we missed the very beginning of your question. Was your question about storage growth?
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes, so my question is about the internal growth of 2.4% in storage, which you noted was in line with your expectations, but it was different than the 4% in the second quarter. Could you just go over those differences? And do you feel like the fourth quarter storage growth internally will be similar to the third?
Brian P. McKeon: So the differences -- we had a very good Q2. The International number came down from 7% to 5%, and that was primarily just reduction from mid-double-digit growth in Latin America to 12%-ish type growth. It was -- we had very good rates. It was just a bit lower. And we did see some -- we had a very good Q2 in Europe, and that's came back down to more normalized levels, I'd argue.
C. Richard Reese: And there's seasonality in the storage side of the business, which lends itself to the first half of the year versus the second half of the year.
Brian P. McKeon: North America, as I mentioned, was down a bit. It was 1.5 versus 2. And that it really is just kind of the quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year comparisons. We were up against the kind of volume built through Q3 of last year, and came down a bit early this year. But net-net, it's been really quite flat. We would expect to see some of those compares be a bit better in Q4. So we're comfortable we're on track to the 4% full year number and the 3% internal number we've been talking about.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. But there's not a lot of difference when you talk about the fourth quarter storage internal growth rate than the third quarter, no other things to call out?
Brian P. McKeon: No, more similar than different, which is typical in our business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: [Audio Gap] on that and dig in a bit into the North American storage. It sounds like the business is flat x pricing and I guess that's been the recent trend, not just this quarter. But what's baked into that mid-term view or the -- was it through 2016 view that you gave at the Investor Day? Is that a continuation of flat North American volumes? And how confident are you that there's not a -- that we're not going to actually see the volume start to decline a bit?
Brian P. McKeon: Well, we -- just going back to Investor Day, we talked about the longer-term outlook being 1% to 3%, including a 1.5% to 2% pricing. So that it is basically flat volume, with revenue growth primarily coming from pricing. And our churn has been stable in North America, what's flowing out. The incoming volume has come down moderately in terms of new sales and organic growth from customers, but we can augment that through additional activities, as well as through things like tuck-in acquisitions or customer acquisitions. And we feel quite confident that we can -- it's a very slow change, and that we can offset that through good return investments that keep the volume flowing in. So we're...
C. Richard Reese: And I think -- look, there's no guarantee about the future in anything, but if you look forward -- look where we are today, look forward versus look back, that you'll see significantly more focus of resources, asset, organization towards driving storage. And that's in marketing programs, sales programs, compensation programs. Everybody is aligned around this agenda, and that was not true looking backwards, and so -- and it will have benefits.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then just following on that, and I'm not trying to give you a hard time, but the thought process around buying in a lot of real estate, if it sounds like we're at a situation were flat is the expectation, how do you think about the decision to buy properties in North America if it's really not growing? I mean, would you buy them in markets where you'd have the ability to consolidate another facility into it if it shrinks? It seems to me, the math isn't quite so obvious if there's the potential for weaker volumes.
C. Richard Reese: Sure. No, look, it's a local market -- it's not a local market decision, it's a local market analysis. If you were to -- and you do run the models of what if the business shrank over the next 50 years and so forth, what's your last building standing, what's your next-to-last building standing and so forth and so on, and those are the obvious ones you want to buy. Okay? And you run your portfolio that way. You also recognize that if you were in a declining situation, you're probably better off to own the real estate so you can have more flexibility of reselling it into the open market than you would be committed to a long lease. So you increase the flexibility of your portfolio, but we're not talking about -- relative to the size of our portfolio, we're not talking about buying in that many of the buildings over time, okay, to make that issue a serious issue. And the last, and certainly not least, is that we would likely deploy -- I don't know if I'd say a disproportion amount, disproportion amount relative to the size of the business, for sure, in emerging markets, where the real estate arbitrage is much, much higher. The cost of debt capital, the cost of lease capital, so to speak, and financing in emerging markets is in line with venture capital returns, and we would likely deploy a significant amount in places like that. And I use kind of over and over the example that we've now gone outside of São Paulo, Brazil, and bought 10 acres of land, and we're going to build a campus there because we can drive very, very much better economics, and we've got a very good, growing business there. And a lot of facilities we can -- on leases we can get out of that we can consolidate out of into.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just one clean-up one. What exactly are the organizational changes in the severance? Is that any -- is that a material number or you're just cleaning a few things up?
Brian P. McKeon: It's in the range of $5 million to $7 million in Q4, and we've got a few different things going on, but basically, we're -- it's part of ongoing productivity-based initiatives we're looking at, where we can be more efficient in the company, and that's what it's related to. So it's more than one activity. They're smaller in terms of their individual scope, but net-net, we do expect a fair bit of severance cost to pull through Q4.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: You guys were discussing the weather impact from Sandy and addressing some of the short-term issues it could have on service. Is there a potential for a positive impact, longer-term, perhaps? And with, I would imagine, very elevated insurance claims, is that something that could show up in 2013?
Brian P. McKeon: Well, I think if we -- I think it's too early to call that. It's -- net-net, I don't think that will be a net benefit to us. It's just too early to call.
C. Richard Reese: Look, I think the only -- generally speaking, the only positive that comes out of these kind of messes are is -- is in certain customers will have heightened awareness around the quality of their own operations and where they're storing things and what they're doing, and be more open to making a change, and then there will likely be a few customers who have a bloody mess after this, and we may get called in to help fix it, which we do from time to time.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just -- it was covered fairly well at the Investor Day, but could you address, Richard, the main verticals, financial services, healthcare, legal, for instance, just what you see for the intermediate-term outlook, the next 12 to 18 months?
C. Richard Reese: In what respect?
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just anything that would deviate from how they've been trending, particularly, healthcare, over the next year or so.
C. Richard Reese: Well, let's take healthcare. What we see in healthcare is a consistent trend. We see actually good, great opportunity inside the healthcare space, as they computerize their health records and so forth. They don't get rid of the paper records for lots of real reasons, good reasons. So we see lots of storage opportunity in the space. We see lots of -- some hybrid or digital scanning opportunities and things like that. I don't know if we see a trend, but they're kind of in the middle of that, and they've got some years of work. The trend is the bigger hospitals started a long time ago, and the bigger healthcare systems, and the smaller ones are still working through it, trying to figure out how to do it. Financial services, what you see there is -- I mean you know it's an industry that's under pressure, and they push that pressure back at their vendors, and we see a lot of that. We see their activity rates have been down since 2007 and '08, come back slightly. Which is the same thing you guys see in the capital markets, okay? If we get robust markets and robust trading and robust everything else, I'm sure their activities -- everybody will be smiling better and their activities will be up and so forth. So I'd say you would see us -- whatever your outlook is for a given vertical in terms of their economic activity, you will see that'll flow through to us, and you'll see that the service sides respond faster and the storage respond slower. There's a lag there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Can you just comment a little bit on Slide 12 where it looks like there's an increase in both organic additions and destructions? Can you provide any color as to what's going on kind of on a sequential basis?
Brian P. McKeon: Just finding the slide, Shlomo, sorry. And you're looking at the outgoing volume on Slide 12?
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Yes, it looks like there was a step up both in outgoing volume and in organic additions, and I just wanted to know if there's any color you could provide behind that.
Brian P. McKeon: You do see there's some seasonality in numbers. I think, sometimes, it's important to look at Q3 to Q3 levels. I think what you see in the organic additions is they're relatively stable. And on the outgoing volume, Q3 to Q3 is actually down a bit and are now calling -- you typically have some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. It's driven -- and many times, larger events can cause quarter-to-quarterly fluctuation. I think, overall, if you look at where Q2 and Q3 are, they're actually down from where they were the prior 3 quarters, and so -- it's one of the reasons we talk about the compares year-on-year is we knew we had some increase in the outgoing volume a little earlier in the year, and that stabilized down so we have a tougher compare in Q3, but that should be sequentially a bit better as we get into Q4.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: What seasonality is there in this business? Can you just give us from a practical standpoint why there's a seasonality in 3Q? What is behind it, if that's indeed what this chart is saying, in your view?
C. Richard Reese: Seasonality in the business is more related -- you'll see a higher growth of storage in the first couple of quarters because people are cleaning out last year's records. That's the biggest trend you see in terms of gross adds, gross additions coming in.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of the corporate, it seems like you guys are taking costs down in the OIB and that's positively impacting OIBDA. Can you talk about some of the items that happened that affected the quarter on a sequential basis?
Brian P. McKeon: On corporate costs, Shlomo?
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Yes.
Brian P. McKeon: It's flow-through benefits of -- we had a number of initiatives we started advancing really late last year around looking at our support cost areas and trying to make sure they're well-aligned with good customer service, but also being as efficient as we can be, and we're seeing the flow-through benefits of that. So it's across a number of functional areas. It's something that we expect to continue to do on an ongoing basis, and I think what you're seeing more than anything is, given when we advance those initiatives, we're starting to see the flow-through benefits of those year-on-year.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then the lower revenue from fuel surcharges, is this just index-based stuff that you just had lower charges so you had lower -- lower fuel so lower surcharges?
Brian P. McKeon: Yes, surcharges were down. Fuel prices have been down a bit and they were down about $1 million year-on-year in the quarter.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then the last question I have, is this the first time you've had back-to-back quarters of sequential down volumes in North America? So we had last quarter, you noted it on the Analyst Day as well, but is this kind of a historical period? Or is this something that has really been happening over the last few years just it's so close to 0 that you haven't really called it out?
Brian P. McKeon: It's been basically flat. We're -- if you look at the volumes and how they've trended over the last several quarters, it's been up a bit, down slightly, but basically flat and we're expecting flat this year, so it's -- I would say the headline in storage is flat in North America.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I'm not talking about revenue. I'm talking about volumes.
Brian P. McKeon: I am too. Storage volume is flat. Down a bit because of the compare of Q3 to Q3, and that reflects just some of the ebbing and flowing of volume coming in now. But as we go forward, we expect it to be flat. That's where we'll be this year. So that's really the broader theme, is it's relatively flat.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Apologize if you answered this already, but the components of the core services, I know part of that's fuel, part of it is just healthcare activity overall. Can you just bracket in kind of round numbers what drove the decline there and how you're thinking about healthcare, in particular? Richard, I know that continues to be an area that -- on the service side, that's been a little slower, just how we're thinking about that going forward?
C. Richard Reese: Well, I think -- we're thinking that healthcare is going to continue to decline and roughly come down to -- over quite a period of time, to about half of what it used to be. And it's got few more years before it will get itself to that level, I think. And I think the rest of it is more -- the bigger part of the rest of it is more economic activity. So it depends on the economies, what comes to on there, I think. So thank you, everybody, for coming this morning. We do try to keep to at least an hour, and I started off extending it short. I've always misjudged that so I apologize to you. I know you have other calls to get to. Thanks for coming to Investor Day, and we look forward to continue to communicate with you, and we'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Lindsay, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Iron Mountain's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Golden, you may begin your conference.
Stephen P. Golden: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our 2012 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me this morning are Richard Reese, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian McKeon, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earning call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2012 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release. With that, I'd like to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Richard Reese.
C. Richard Reese: Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everybody. And welcome to our second quarter investor conference call. We had good operating results for the quarter. I'd characterize them frankly as good results in a slow world. I'll go through and give you some update on the trends and what's going on, and then -- and I'll have a few comments about the REIT process, which I'm sure you're all eager to wait to hear. The headline is you're not going to hear everything you want to hear about their REIT, because it hasn't changed a lot, but we will at least give you some color and some update. And then Brian will go through the detailed numbers and, as usual, we'll take your questions. With a little luck, we will attempt to make this call shorter than average, because I think things are fairly clear and it's summertime. So let's get started. As I've said, I think we're having good execution in the organization, and the businesses are performing well against our plans. We're doing not only on a tactical or an annual operating basis, but you should be comfortable that we're also advancing our long-term strategy to continue building out a very durable storage annuity business. So we're making progress on both fronts and finally trying to balance all those to deliver the short-term results while keeping an eye on the future. And I think the company and the team is doing a good job at that. As I've said, we'll update you on the REIT process, where the only significant news, which we did announce in our press release, is that we have submitted formally our request to the IRS for a private letter ruling. And as you know that we are going to be relatively silent and absolutely not speak to any details on that while we let them do their work and so forth. So let me talk a little bit about the operating results. Storage, which is the key driver and everything we focus on in our business, had good 6% constant dollar revenue growth, which was about 4% of that, 4 points out of 6 was internal growth and the balance from acquisitions. Service trends remain consistent within the past year or 2. There were some puts and takes, but constant dollar service growth was about flat excluding the impacts of the lower paper -- recycled paper prices. Recycled paper prices in the quarter were the major issue to us, with a 37% decline from last year, and it reduced reported service revenue growth by a negative 4% but also total revenue growth by 1.5 points. North America, as we had planned and as we communicated, sustained good strong margins of 42% and adjusted OIBDA levels while posting 2% internal growth of storage. But total revenue growth in North America felt the brunt of recycled paper trends, hard to say, as North America accounts for about 85% of our total recycled paper volume. International had strong storage growth at 13% in constant dollars, which was 8% internal and the balance from acquisitions. They had some slight softness we experienced in International and service trends, which we suspect is part of the slowdown globally, particularly in the U.K. and in Europe and their economies. But those trends were only slight. And as I said, overall as a company, our service revenues were about flat. Internal growth in International, particularly storage, trended up slightly due to the higher-than-average customer acquisition activity. This was just a good, strong quarter. And although the dynamics in International are strong, this will move around a bit. So we're not forecasting these numbers. You can't draw a line forward from these numbers. These are great numbers, but I don't predict they will reoccur over and over every quarter. You will see some come back to this level in the future, but it's going to move around just a bit. In line with our operating strategy, during the -- and we've spoken before during the quarter, and we've announced most of these. But just to recap, we acquired records management businesses in Hungary as a fold-in to our existing business and Brazil to solidify our market leadership position, as we've previously announced. Both of these markets have strong outsourcing trends and are very consistent with our strategy to build market leadership in faster-growing emerging markets. We also increased some ownership stakes in some joint ventures we had previously set up in Switzerland and Turkey, consistent with our long-standing joint venture strategy where we typically enter in new markets on an International basis sometimes with a less than 100% or even less than majority control. But as the businesses evolve and turn into real businesses, we seek to buy out partners or buy up, in effect, become over time to eventual ownership, and we executed a couple of those during the quarter. International also continued to make significant progress against their benchmark target that we set 1.5 years ago to increase our margins by 700 basis points, and they generated 150 basis points of improvement during the quarter. They are on track for the full year growth of about 200 basis points, that's what their plan says, and they're on track for that. And looking forward to the end of the year, assuming they hit their plans, which we fully expect, since we announced this increase of 700 basis points, we will have reported and generated about 500 basis points or nearly 70% of the way towards our improvement target. And to remind you, we still have one more year to go to complete that target. That margin came -- increasing came from sort of 3 big buckets. In Western Europe, sort of the International business, it was really about a lot of overhead initiatives, a lot of reengineering of cost structures and process, most of which are designed to improve our operating efficiency and effectiveness all at the same time. In Latin America, we've been focusing on our direct labor and utilization, what we call operational excellence. It's the same strategy we started in North America some years ago and then rolled it to Europe. Now we're rolling it into Latin America, and that's showing good margin enhancement, improvements. And of course, it's easier to get good margin when you got good growth. And the International businesses, as I said, have had good, strong growth. So it's a combination of those 3 that have generated that. Team's doing a good job. We expect them to continue doing that and to hit their margins. We also saw some flow-through of some margin accretion efforts did in our corporate functions, because we started investing a little over a year ago, and some improvements where we wanted to improve our internal service to ourselves as well as reduce costs. And those investments had a price tag, both in terms of OpEx as well as capital, and they're starting to flow through. And we saw about 40 basis points of margin generated by the projects we started a little over a year ago. So I think we're in really good shape on the margin front, and frankly, given the markets we operate in and so forth, I think we're doing quite well on the revenue front right now. A little bit of update on our strategy just to remind those that either forget or haven't been listening or new to the story, whichever the case may be, it is our goal to continue to build a very durable storage-based annuity business, as I've said in the beginning. In doing that, we have already optimized and have a very good return on investment, North American business segment, which we believe can grow in the low single-digits and maintain their margins. That is not as easy to do as it sounds. In low-growth environments, maintaining margins is very hard to do. But the team is focused on doing it and so forth. And it's a business that we will continue to invest in, and there -- around -- on the edge, there are ways of raising the growth rates a little bit. And we will keep focused on that, but it'll be a very measured kind of a process over a long period of time, because the strategy is not to build a super-high-growth business. The strategy is to maintain a really strong business there, and we're very comfortable we can do that. Whereas International, our strategy has been over the last 18 months as we shifted the focus of the strategy away from a portfolio build-out market presence strategy to really a portfolio return strategy. And we have been driving returns on invested capital up to the point that the entire portfolio has returns in excess of a weighted average cost of capital. And when we complete the program and the margin improvement programs, these businesses as a total portfolio will be generating very strong returns. And I'll remind you that in that portfolio, some of them already have North American-like returns, quite a bit of them do. But we still have some business International that are in their [ph] early stages of development where the returns are either negative to very low. But they're faster-growing, and they will grow their way into better returns, and they will optimize their way into even better returns, as we've done all around the world. And we're on a good path to do that, and I think the team is focused on that and executing well. Part of that strategy is expanding in emerging markets through acquisitions as well as new customer acquisition work to capital leadership. We know that market leadership drives out-of-line or extraordinary returns of invested capital, and that is our goal for the entire business. So as I said, we're executing on all levels of our operating strategy, and we feel very strong about our ability to continue to build out a very doable storage-driven business over time. Another element of that strategy, though, that relates to it that, as you know, in June, we announced is a new, focused capital allocation strategy. It is a strategy in which we've committed to return excess capital that this operating strategy will generate to our shareholders. And of course, as part of that capital allocation strategy, which is one that brings a lot of discipline, is using a tactic to pursue a new or alternative structure operating as a REIT. And you know, we've announced our intention to do that. As I've said, we believe that a REIT provides substantial benefits to our shareholders, first, for efficient capital distribution. But it also comes with a burden of extreme capital allocation discipline. And we think that, that burden is acceptable, both as a management team and as a shareholder, to take in return for the efficiency that we would get out of this structure and so forth. So we're embarked on both a strong operating strategy to build a very sustainable long-term cash generation energy engine, by the way, one that we've been doing for a long period of time. We have reached the point, though, in which instead of consuming capital to build this business, we are in the very nice position of having significant excess capital. And as I've said, we've gone through the work to understand and believe that the right thing to do is distribute that capital to our shareholders, regardless of whether the tactics ultimately pan out to be a REIT or not. The strategy is one of disciplined capital allocation. So let me talk a little bit about the REIT. As I've said as I started, a couple of things. This is not a subject that we're going to give you a lot on. To be frank with you, we don't have a lot to give you, more than we've already told you. We've been out on the road talking since we have made the announcement early June, and so for those -- and I would expect that most of you who got a chance to see us or hear us, there's not a lot that's changed . And frankly, what we also told you was as it did change, we're not going to give you blow-by-blow or play-by-play color on this, that and the other and so forth. If it turns out that the IRS approves us, obviously, we'll tell you. If they reject us, we'll, obviously, tell you. If we were to find a reason it couldn't work, we will, obviously, tell you. But we're going about trying to execute on becoming a REIT. We're taking a positive hypothesis approach, which means that we filed for approval from the IRS. While they do their thinking and their work and so forth, we're moving forward with a process to restructure our business to separate entities into the QRS/TRS structure and to have ourselves ready to be a REIT as of January 1, 2014. We've said it before and I'm going to reiterate, it's -- and the more we look, the more I'll have to say this is it's a lot of work. And as you know, we forecast $100 million to $150 million of work to get there. Obviously, we expect the payback to be worth it. We've made significant progress. We've established a task force office headed by Jeff Lawrence. Jeff, as many of you know, is our Treasurer, but he's also been a long-term mountaineer and he has managed prior to this many of our major -- anytime we've had major change projects, such as Y2K and things like that, Jeff has been the go-to guy. He's got extraordinary skills and knowledge of the business, so he knows where every -- all the pieces and parts are. He's organized a team of over 25 full-time people, most of which came up -- we pulled out of other jobs and we're staffed behind them. We've almost completed that REIT staffing behind them, because we see that they're going to be this for a couple of years. We went and tried to pull people that are high-potential strong performers, and basically, making sure that they understand that this is a career-enhancing process. This is the project that you want to be part of, and I think we've chosen quite a bit of good talent to help us do that. That number of people would be augmented over time. I mean, quite frankly, to give you a picture of it, we've had to take another floor in our corporate office building just to house what we expect this workflow to be. And we'll get to be over time significantly more people, some part-time, some full-time. In addition to that, we have a group of outside advisors, primarily but not solely PWC [ph], on the actual technical conversion side because they have direct experience of doing this and direct experience, same team, same people of doing it for nontraditional REIT conversions, which is what we are and which is where the real complexity comes, okay? And IBM and other technology partners, but primarily IBM, is helping us over a lot of the systems work. They -- at the core of this transition is a lot of accounting and IT work and -- with a strong dose of legal and contract work. And it requires us to put in some new systems to get more granular detail on some of our details and systematize them and so forth. Net-net, all of this work we will do will make us a better business. And it would be hard work, but it -- plenty doable if we were doing it for one country, but we're going to do it across the majority of our big businesses around the globe. So I only stress all of that just to give you an appreciation of we're on it, we're not waiting. That is why we're spending money pretty fast. So far, the money that we put in the quarter was not that big. But stay tuned, those numbers will get bigger as we try to separate out and make sure you see the operating side of the business versus what we're spending to achieve this target. So as I've said, I think we feel real good about where we are, both in terms of the process of the REIT, I feel real good about how the business is operating at this point in time. I wish the world were a little faster. I'm not used to this slow pace, it drives me batty. So with that, let's turn it to Brian. He'll go through the details, and we'll come back to take your questions.
Brian P. McKeon: Thanks, Richard. Turning to our presentation, Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. We delivered solid performance in Q2, in line with our expectations, reflecting consistent business trends. Storage -- strong storage revenue growth and International performance again drove our overall results. We achieved 6% constant dollar storage revenue growth in the quarter, supported by internal growth that routed 4% and benefits from our recently completed acquisitions. Storage gains continue to be solid globally despite soft economic conditions, demonstrating the durability of our business. International storage grew 13% constant dollar, augmenting the solid 3% constant dollar storage growth posted by the North American business. We continue to expand our International business while driving higher returns, consistent with our 3-year strategic plan. Adjusted OIBDA margin in the International segment increased 150 basis points on 8% constant dollar revenue growth. Our International business is performing well, and we remain on track to achieve our International margin targets in 2013. Overall, our operating results remain solid and in line with our expectations. Revenue and adjusted OIBDA grew 2% on a constant dollar basis. As noted in previous calls, sharp declines in recycled paper prices are constraining our operating gains this year. In Q2, lower year-on-year paper prices reduced revenues by $11 million. Excluding these impacts, adjusted OIBDA was up 7% on a comparable basis in Q2, reflecting continued storage gains and benefits from International margin expansion and overhead cost controls. On a reported basis, FX changes also constrained reported results. Excluding these macro factors, underlying business trends were consistent with prior quarters. Storage revenues continue to grow steadily, and hybrid service gains are offsetting soft core service activity levels. We remain on track to achieve our full year financial goals, and we're reiterating our underlying revenue and adjusted OIBDA outlook for the full year 2012. We're maintaining a consistent outlook for constant dollar revenue growth while lowering our projections for reported results by $15 million at midpoint to reflect current FX rates. Our adjusted OIBDA, free cash flow and adjusted EPS ranges are unchanged from our previous outlook. These estimates reflect our underlying operations and exclude costs associated with the Special Committee and REIT conversion. We'll be tracking these costs separately as we work through the conversion process. Let's now turn to Slide 4 and review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our operating results for this quarter to the second quarter of 2011. Please note that we'll be referring to our operating results throughout this presentation. Operating results exclude costs and other expenditures associated with the 2011 proxy contest, the Special Committee and REIT conversion costs. In Q2 2012, we incurred $3 million of costs related to the Special Committee work compared to about $10 million of costs related to the proxy contest in Q2 of 2011. We're excluding these items, which are expected to be significant over the next several quarters, in order to better present the underlying performance of the business. The primary line items that will be impacted are adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS, CapEx and free cash flow. For your information, slides reconciling operating results to our reported results for key metrics are included in the appendix. As noted, Q2 operating results were solid and in line with our expectations, reflecting consistent business trends. Enterprise revenue growth was 2% on a constant dollar basis, with reported results pressured by unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes. Overall, revenue performance reflected strong constant dollar storage growth -- revenue growth of 6%, which more than offset the impact of lower recycled paper revenues, which reduced total revenue growth by 1.5%. From a segment perspective, North America posted constant currency revenue growth of minus 1% as consistent 2% storage internal growth was offset by a 6% decline in service revenues, including the impact of lower paper prices. Excluding paper price changes, North American service growth was down modestly. Gains in project and data protection revenues and benefits from fuel surcharges offset decreased core service activity levels and lower revenues from shredding and fulfillment services. Our International segment posted 8% constant currency revenue growth, supported by 13% storage growth, reflecting sustained gains in Europe, continued double-digit growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific and benefits from our recently completed acquisition in Brazil. These gains were again augmented by strong hybrid service revenues, which offset impacts from lower paper prices, and lower revenues from product sales and shredding services. Gross profit was $439 million in Q2, yielding a gross margin of 58.4%, down 110 basis points compared to the same prior-year period. Storage gross margins increased 100 basis points, reflecting lower occupancy costs. Service gross margins were down year-on-year due to decreased recycled paper revenues, the previously disclosed reclassification of certain overhead expenses to costs of sales and the growth of relatively lower-margin businesses, including our hybrid services. Adjusted OIBDA was $239 million or 31.8% of revenues, up 40 basis points compared to Q2 of 2011. Strong performance in our International business and the benefits from corporate overhead cost initiatives more than offset negative impacts from lower paper prices. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.36 per share, an increase of 9%. The improvement was primarily due to fewer shares outstanding following substantial share repurchases in 2011. Reported earnings per share of $0.24 includes $3 million of excluded items, $10 million of other expense and the impact of a higher effective tax rate due to foreign currency losses and discrete tax items. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 40%. Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 shows the components building to our overall revenue growth. Q2 and year-to-date growth is trending consistent with our full year expectations by a major service line. As noted, constant dollar growth was 2% in Q2, driven by strong storage gains. Storage internal growth remained solid at 4%. North America reported consistent 2% internal storage growth, and International storage internal growth remains strong at 8%. Net global Records Management volume was up more than 1% on a year-on-year basis in Q2, reflecting continued strong gains in International, offsetting a modest year-on-year decline in North America. Pricing trends remain consistent, with a 2% net increase in North American Records Management. Total service internal growth was minus 5% or down about 2% excluding impacts from commodity changes. These results were also consistent with underlying trends in recent quarters. Core service internal growth was minus 3% in the quarter as growth in the hybrid services and benefits from fuel surcharges offset lower shredding service revenues and moderate declines in activity-based core services. Complimentary service revenues representing about 11% of total revenues decreased 12% internally. Results were driven entirely by $11 million decline in recycled paper revenues, as expected. The impact in Q2 was greater than the impact in Q1 as 2012 paper prices have remained fairly stable against sharply rising prices in the first half of 2011. Assuming paper prices remain stable for the balance of the year, the gap should widen in third quarter before reversing itself in the last couple of months of the year. Let's now take a look at our year-to-date results on Slide 6. Slide 6 looks at our year-to-date 2012 operating performance compared to the first half of 2011. Our year-to-date performance reflects consistent business trends. Reported revenue of $1.5 billion is up 1% on a constant dollar basis as continued solid storage gains offset impacts from lower recycled paper prices and soft core service activity. Lower paper prices and the SG&A reclass discussed earlier contributed to a modest decline in gross margins. Despite these impacts, adjusted OIBDA grew 2% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis, slightly ahead of revenue growth. Strong International profit performance and corporate overhead cost initiatives are key factors in this improvement. We expect these factors to continue to support profit performance as we move forward. Adjusted EPS was $0.67 per share, up 8% for the year-to-date. EPS benefited from about 15% fewer shares outstanding, more than offsetting higher interest costs incurred to support our $1.2 billion shareholder payout program that we completed earlier this year. 2012 capital spending is $76 million, excluding $11 million of acquired real estate. As a percentage of revenues, CapEx excluding real estate is 5.1%, in line with prior year levels. Capital expenditures historically increased in the second half of the year. We're currently on track to achieve our capital spending efficiency targets in 2012. Free cash flow for the first half of 2012 was $117 million compared to $149 million for the first half of 2011. The decrease is primarily due to higher interest expense in support of our shareholder payout program and higher cash incentive compensation payments related to 2011 performance. These results exclude year-to-date costs of $5 million in 2012 and $14 million in 2011 associated with the REIT conversion, Special Committee and prior year proxy costs. These year-to-date costs reduced 2012 reported EPS by $0.02 and free cash flow by about $3 million. Through the end of Q2, we've not made any capital expenditures or incremental tax payments related to the REIT conversion. We expect to make these types of payments in the second half of this year. I'll have more to say on this in the Outlook section of the presentation. Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review our results by segment. Slide 7 shows key year-to-date metrics for each of our 3 key segments compared to the same period in 2011. Consistent with our 3-year plan, we're sustaining high returns in our North American segment while continuing to build momentum in our International segment as a significant driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. In the first half of 2012, our North America business segment reported revenues of $1.1 billion, supported by consistent 2% storage revenue gains. Overall, North America growth was constrained by the impact of lower recycled paper prices. Despite these impacts, we sustained adjusted OIBDA margins of 42%. We also continued to achieve capital efficiencies, with spending at about 4% of revenues excluding real estate. These metrics support very strong cash generation from this business. Our International segment continues to post solid constant dollar revenue growth and strong adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. As noted, adjusted OIBDA increased 15% excluding FX impacts, yielding 180 basis points of margin expansion. We're benefiting from cost improvement initiatives in Western European markets and strong profit performance in Latin America. Benefits from these initiatives and from continued solid growth across our International portfolio has us on track towards our business plan goals of 25% margins in 2013. Corporate expenses improved slightly compared with prior-year levels due to overhead cost control initiatives. Overall, we continue to drive solid operating performance across our portfolio. Let's now take a look at our debt statistics on Slide 8. Strong consistent cash flow generation has enabled us to maintain a strong balance sheet. We're currently operating with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.5x, comfortably within our target 3 to 4x leverage range. Our leverage ratio will likely increase over the next few quarters as we make expenditures in connection with the REIT conversion process. We remain well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was more than $600 million, with $170 million in cash and $455 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our debt portfolio at June 30, 2012 also remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate was down to 6.6%, and we were nearly 80% fixed at quarter end. Maturity is about 6 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. During the second quarter, we paid $43 million in regular quarterly dividends at a rate of $0.25 per share. In June, the board increased the dividend rate by 8% to $0.27 per share. We're managing our balance sheet and cash flows consistent with our strategy, and we're well positioned to fund our business plan. That concludes our review of Q2 2012 results. Overall, we continue to drive solid financial performance, and we're on track to achieve our goals in 2012. Let's now turn to Slide 9 to review our full year outlook. Slide 9 summarizes our current 2012 operating outlook. The chart also highlights our expected expenditures related to the ongoing REIT conversion process. Today, we're reiterating our constant dollar revenue growth guidance and our projections for adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We are lowering the midpoint of our revenue projections by $15 million to reflect current FX rates, which weakened relative to the U.S. dollar since our last call. We're projecting 2012 reported revenues to be in the range of $2,990,000,000 to $3,040,000,000 at current FX rates, reflecting consistent 2% to 4% constant dollar growth excluding the impact of lower paper prices. We're maintaining our outlook for adjusted OIBDA to be in the range of $890 million to $930 million on an operating basis. Adjusted EPS for 2012 is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.36, unchanged for the prior outlook. The calculation of adjusted EPS assumes a 40% structural tax rate and 172 million shares outstanding. We now expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $225 million, including an estimated $30 million for real estate. The increase reflects a real estate lease buyout opportunity we recently took advantage of in Ireland. Our outlook for operating free cash flow continues to be in the range of $320 million to $360 million. As highlighted in a recent announcement of our intent to pursue conversion to a REIT, we anticipate significant one-time operating capital costs associated with the conversion. Total operating expense and capital costs are estimated to be between $100 million to $150 million, with the majority deployed over the next 2 to 3 years. These costs relate to substantial system investments, legal and tax work, advisory fees and other miscellaneous costs to implement the proposed structure. This effort is under way, and we'll be breaking out and reporting on estimated impacts as we advance the process. For 2012, in addition to the operating expense expectations discussed above, we expect to incur between $10 million to $20 million of incremental expense, $10 million of CapEx and about $80 million in additional taxes related to the depreciation recapture in connection with the REIT conversion. The impact of these items will be a reduction in adjusted EPS of $0.03 to $0.07 and free cash flow of $95 million to $105 million. The current full year outlook does not include any projected impact from potential 2012 distribution of earnings and profits in connection with the conversion. A slide laying out our outlook for line items below adjusted OIBDA is included in the appendix. That concludes our review. In summary, Q2 was another quarter of solid financial performance, and we're on track to achieve our financial goals for 2012. We continue to execute against our 3-year plan, sustaining high profits and cash flow in North America and driving strong growth and higher returns in our International business. And we're also advancing working connection with the REIT conversion process as long -- as part of our long-term approach to drive value creation for our stockholders. Thanks, and we'd now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess the first question, just on Europe, your commentary on the International segment was positive. But how should we think about the impact of what seems like it's been pretty evident deterioration over the last few months in the economic activity across the continent?
C. Richard Reese: Well, as you know, in our business, on the way down, we tend to lag. On the way up, we tend to lag. And I think we probably are seeing that. Storage remains strong and -- even in Europe and International in general. And I think storage will hold up okay, if not do fine through this. Service, we saw softness. Just as we saw it come down in North America, we saw it in this quarter. It'll find a new good [ph] point when their economy settles and sort of stay there. Whether we've hit that yet or not, I don't know. But net-net, as I've said in my comments, we've had some puts and takes. We've had some strengths and other pieces and parts of things, so overall, our services are about flat if you take recycled paper out. So on a global basis, I think we're feeling all right. I mean, we're not projecting it going to rise, don't get me wrong. But I think we're feeling all right.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And -- but just on that lag comment, so could things likely get worse next year? And I guess, is there any risk to the margin target for International? Or do you think you've got a pretty conservative case built into how you're thinking about it?
C. Richard Reese: Well, I don't think we have a conservative case. But I think we can deliver it, yes.
Brian P. McKeon: The margin improvement is really driven by things in our control...
C. Richard Reese: Yes, it's mostly stuff we can control.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just any update on how you're thinking about the succession plan for the CEO role?
C. Richard Reese: Yes, I'm trying to get out. No, look, we're -- it's a very methodical process. And we -- and look, the board is working quite hard and being pretty methodical about it. But look, the truth is I'm not putting the feet to the fire. I started down this path to help the company get a line around a strategy, which I think we've done really well, the business has. And part of that strategy was the capital allocation strategy. As I've said, we've done our year of homework, and we've come out the other end with a direction, and now we go about executing. I'm not running from the completion of that. So it's a matter of finding the right person when we find him at the right time, and until we do, I'll stay here and try to help the team get this stuff across the goal line.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Great. And then just one cleanup one. Can you give us a sense how much you spent on all these acquisitions in the quarter? And was the revenue contribution material, or were they all pretty small deals?
Brian P. McKeon: It's roughly $90 million in the quarter -- I'm sorry, $98 million. The bulk of that was Brazil and the Swiss buyout. This year, we won't see a lot of profit flow through just because the integration cost in Brazil will offset some of the benefit. But it'll be nicely accretive for us as we head into 2013.
C. Richard Reese: And by the way, the -- not always, but the nature of the kinds of acquisitions we would likely do international will be the kind of things where you buy now and it will take you 12-plus months to really see the synergy, because we're not typically buying new footprint. There will be some rare exceptions to that statement. But we already did the heavy lifting of putting the footprint in place. Now we're really try to buy major fold-in, tuck-in. And the big fold-in, tuck-ins take a little time to do right and continue growing fast and maintain and so forth. So we're taking our time on those.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's Andrew. I want to ask a question about the slide that goes through global volume trends. I would have thought, given the storage growth being at 4%, kind of a nice, accelerated level that we haven't been at for a while, that chart that you have in the slide decks would also show acceleration. Could you go through the differences between what that slide is trying to portray and how it ties back to storage internal growth?
Brian P. McKeon: And so the slide actually is a -- it takes quarterly performance and annualizes it, Andrew. And so it's because we're trying to break it out across these key metrics that we found that that's the easiest way to show it. And that compares to when we talk about that growth, we're talking about year-over-year volume. So it's slightly different. I think the key theme here is more consistency than change in terms of the trends. If you look at the storage growth in the quarter, it rounded to 4%. It was a little -- it was 3.5%, actually. And we've been in that 3% range for the last -- since, I think it's 7, 8 quarters now. Some of the benefit was -- improvement was related to customer acquisition activity in International, just in terms of, as you know, kind of the old [indiscernible] terminology that we use when we acquire customers from other businesses, customer relationships we had, some of that flow-through from a timing of...
C. Richard Reese: And, Andrew, I think you sort of said it's just a good, strong quarter, how do we portraying? Look, we're positive about the business in the economy we operate in. It's a crappy world out there, okay? But we're not suggesting -- in fact, I am cautioning, that you don't take a strong storage quarter and try to project it forward that we're going to stay at these levels. I don't believe we will. I think we'll move up and down. We'll see this level again, I'm not saying that, okay? But it might not be next quarter or the quarter after. I think we're going to be hovering around the 3%, 3-ish range, give or take, 3.5%, 2.75%, hovering around there. And they round the different numbers, as you know. We'll be hovering around those ranges. And I think we can do that very well and so forth, but we're not talking about major acceleration here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: I just want to get some color on your acquisitions in Hungary, Switzerland and Turkey. How did the acquisitions position you from a market share perspective, and when can you expect to achieve market leadership in those countries?
C. Richard Reese: In Hungary, it was a nice bolt-in and we already had market leadership there. It was just good economics. Switzerland, we've got leadership in everything except Geneva. And Turkey, we are a strong #2.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Got it, that's very helpful. And could you give us a sense of how -- just globally, how activity-based core services performed and how much hybrid services contributed to growth?
C. Richard Reese: [indiscernible] while I look [ph].
Brian P. McKeon: Yes, I was thinking -- hybrid services were a -- were up solidly on a global basis. It wasn't -- it was probably a point or so of contribution net to our overall service growth. And that helped to moderate the -- basically helped to offset the continued moderate decline we've seen in service levels in places like the U.S. And, as Richard noted, I think the International...
C. Richard Reese: Some acceleration in the International.
Brian P. McKeon: International was not -- International had been growing quite well, and we saw that moderate somewhat. So that could be a leading indicator.
C. Richard Reese: And as you know, we fully expect that our hybrid business, as it gets bigger and it's still growing well, will overcome other declines in the physical business. I'm not calling that turn yet, but this quarter, that pretty much happened. But again, I wouldn't say it's for sure it's going to happen next quarter or the one after. Still a little early to tell that we're drawing the lines yet, guys.
George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: And then last question. You touched on this earlier but could you give us a sense of how the volatility in Europe is impacting core and complementary services? I know you're on track to achieving the margin expectations, but do you see any negative impact and deceleration in growth due to that?
Brian P. McKeon: We haven't for the last -- in terms of our business overall, I think it's held out very well. And I think the team [ph] feels good about the ability to sustain that. We are highlighting at the margin, we're seeing some deceleration level of growth in the service activity. But I would say the theme is more that we're holding up quite well. And I think we're going to plan the business prudently and make sure we're managing appropriately in an environment that could get softer for us. But I think it's more -- at this stage, more at the margin and something that we're keeping an eye on.
C. Richard Reese: Yes, and look, I'd tell you, sort of the key theme if you look at our total growth and so forth is our Shredding businesses, although they're growing on units and everything else, we see some price compression. So a good part of that. It used to be -- it still is a very aggressive price market. Although, in general, at the Street, that has modified itself a bit as paper prices have come down, which is what you'd expect. We are still rolling off some rather large multi-year agreements that were priced in a different market environment, and as they roll off, they get repriced. We'll -- that will run off, but the tail of that's coming, and it'll run off and so forth. But our -- but the Shredding business between that dynamic and the -- and, of course, the paper prices themselves is as much a drag on total revenue as anything, so forth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Following up on your comments on paper prices. We've heard that expectation in the market is that prices should actually gradually improve over the course of the year. Are you hearing the same, and any additional color there?
C. Richard Reese: We've heard conflicting data. Some people say they believe at the demand level, it's strengthening, at the front-line demand level, it's strengthening. That would naturally lead to some increase, and others say not. So we don't have an opinion on that right now. But look, North America may strengthen while Europe doesn't. Some of this will be about where China goes, because a lot of this recycled paper winds up in China. And their economy -- you guys know better than I do the changes going on over there. So I think it's a little early to make a call.
Brian P. McKeon: There's a bit of seasonality in the business where the pricing goes down a bit in the back half of the year normally. We've seen sort of modest improvement on the sorted office paper rate. So we'll -- it's gotten relatively better, but this does get tied into the overall demand situation. So right now, we're -- the numbers that we're using basically reflect the debt that [indiscernible] will sustain.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then on your global records management slide, it looks like you had the lowest level of destructions in the past 10 quarters. Anything going on there?
Brian P. McKeon: We did see -- it's a little different geographically. But actually, in Europe, we've seen a decline in some of the destruction levels. These things tend to move around a fair bit where you have some larger destructions that people may be planning, and you work through them. And so there is some volatility in that, but we've seen some contraction there that's helping...
C. Richard Reese: And by the way, the Europe destruction pattern is behaving the way the business historically always behaved except for the 2007, '08 financial crisis period, which is in slowdowns, people delay destructions because they're protecting their current year budget. So as the storage pickup -- storage charge, rental pickup for destroying the item is not as large as the -- in the current period, as large as the destruction fee, and they try to protect their budget. And I suspect that's what we're seeing there now.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That's helpful. And then if I could fit one more in. You bought the controlling interests in your Turkish and Swiss JVs this quarter. Were the acquisitions related to the REIT conversion at all? I mean, are you going to maybe accelerate kind of converting JVs into company-owned quicker because of the REIT conversion?
C. Richard Reese: No, no. The JVs themselves, by and large, the ones we have right now are in kind of the emerging markets, strong, extreme emerging market front. And -- which means they would be late in our cycle of REIT conversion, as in not this year or next or the year after. Over due course of time, we would want to deal with those sort of things. But we're not going to be pushed into doing that.
Brian P. McKeon: We're starting with what makes sense from a strategic point of view, a value-creation point of view, and then we'll factor in how to think about the REIT more as the tail on that kind of consideration. So these are good, strategic investments that we'd be doing regardless of the path we're pursuing as a company.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Brian, can you remind us, on the core services side, just round numbers, what percentage is kind of related to the destruction and other type services just to kind of get a sense of the contributions to that revenue line item?
Brian P. McKeon: It's a smaller part, so I'm going to find it. But 5% we're seeing. So it's -- we have a long list of services that we provide there in core services, the bigger items are things like transportation activity. But destruction services contribute to that. Overall, the core services are a little north of 30% of total revenues.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Got it. And then in terms of timing on the distribution of the equity, is that something, Richard, we can talk about now? Or just any sense of -- I know the IRS is in the process of the private letter ruling. But just any sense of timing around when we can expect any update on that?
C. Richard Reese: Well, our view hasn't changed from what we've said in early June. And that view is that we would strongly consider, but we haven't 100% committed to, but strongly consider doing a major E&P purge sometime during this year. I think you would expect it towards the back end of the year. And there's a lot of mechanics to actually making that work since it would be a combination of cash and stock. But we're moving forward on that front as all others. That decision in itself does not depend upon the, necessarily, the private letter ruling, in fact.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Understood, that's helpful. And then are we going to have an Investor Day this year? Is that back on, or...
C. Richard Reese: Yes, we are -- we had hoped to have the precise date. We don't yet. We're nailing down the venue and we -- but we will have an Investor Day in October in New York City. And within a couple of days, we expect to have out the invitation with the exact date and time and so forth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: First, I wanted to start off with a couple of technical questions. Just Brian, on the $10 million to $20 million of cost that you're experiencing this year, did you say that, that was outside of the $100 million to $150 million that you previously talked about in the June conference call?
Brian P. McKeon: Sorry if we confused on that. No, it's a subset of that, so it's within the $100 million, $150 million. We expect to incur $10 million to $20 million of OpEx this year and about $10 million of capital. The $100 million to $150 million is both the OpEx and capital. I think our estimates were -- was like 60% capital, which is largely the systems, and 40% OpEx. But we'll be breaking this out for you as we go, and actually, we'll start adding some tracking relative to the overall estimates for you as well so it's very clear how we're...
C. Richard Reese: And it will -- and that will get spread beyond January 1, 2014, because there's -- it's a strategy to get ourselves to the point where we can legally convert and operate. But it won't be as pretty as it likely -- we'd like it to be by that date, and we will continue working beyond that. So those expenses will flow on beyond that.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: That makes sense. Just in terms of that process, now that the team has been kind of assembled and started off on this path, Richard, just kind of curious. I mean, obviously, very complex. Can you just give us any positive or negative surprises that may have arisen that couldn't -- that could help or hinder your ability to hit that January 2014 date?
C. Richard Reese: No, I don't -- look, I -- we've gone to the detailed planning. I think we have 20-odd work streams all running in parallel. We've got program managers, project managers. We've really gotten it organized as just as a massive kind of project. But look, the tall pole on the tent, so to speak, is in the systems arena. And it's primarily in the arena of -- we actually have to change our charter of accounts for our entire accounting system and, in many ways, update some technology and/or convert technology, particularly some of the global platforms. And some of that, we made two-step because it's too much risk to do one-step. And when you're doing that much technology change, to be candid with you, our goal is to have all those systems operating mid-next year to give us 6 months of working out the kinks and making sure nothing happens. And our head -- our Chief Information Officer is sweating a lot right now. He and his team are doing good work, and they'll get it done. And so, no, we're not -- this is not something that I lay awake at night worrying about. But then again, I don't do this kind of execution. Brian does it, and his team and Jeff and [indiscernible], those guys do it. And they're sweating a bit and complaining to me not go off and do anything else, but that's not my nature either.
Brian P. McKeon: To your question, no surprises. We thought it was a lot of work, and that's turning out to be true. And we'll -- we've got a really good team working on it and committed to getting this done.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And the -- just thinking about the capital base and some of the capital needs that you have this year, Richard, can you kind of just update our thinking? It sounds like you mentioned the $600 million of liquidity that you have today. That would be, I guess, all of your cash and all of your credit facility. Can you talk about kind of what you're seeing out in the market to maybe fund any hole that you might have in the capital base to do the E&P in some of these other investments?
Brian P. McKeon: What I -- we have discussed it's likely we're going to go to the market at some point to help fund that, and we'll update you as we move forward on that. But we will likely want to put some more kind of financing in place...
C. Richard Reese: Yes, and our sense is the market environment is quite good right now.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: When you -- you mentioned in your comments here that your guidance does not impact any -- or does not reflect any impact of the E&P distribution. Is that really the financing terms of that E&P distribution? Is there any other impact that it would have to your P&L, or is it the cost?
Brian P. McKeon: It would include the -- obviously, there is a cash outflow. But keep in mind, too, if we did a majority of our E&P distribution this year, which is -- which has been our plan that we signal. There would be a number of shares that are issued, right, that go along with it. So we...
C. Richard Reese: Per-share metrics would change, your interest cost would change and so forth.
Brian P. McKeon: It effectively works like a stock split. But we haven't plugged any of that into the outlook, and we'll obviously get you more details as we firm up plans there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolas.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just to piggyback a little bit on the last line of questioning. Just to be clear, you're thinking of funding -- you're going to fund the gap with debt, not equity, right?
C. Richard Reese: Yes, that would be our current intention, recognizing that we're going to do, likely, 80% of it in issuance of the stock, yes.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: The question is in order to get into the REIT structure, the whole that you have in terms of the capital, that's going to require you to raise capital. You're planning to do that with a debt offering or more bank debt, but it is not going back to the markets for an equity offer.
C. Richard Reese: Correct. We don't need equity. We don't need equity. And I'm never going to say we won't go to the markets for equity. You tell me the price, and I'll tell you if we'll go. But as we sit here today, we don't perceive going to the markets. It's not in my -- our thinking at the moment for equity. I would tell you, though, just to be clear, just to close out that subject for you a little bit. As we do M&A, we may use some equity and transactions to the extent that the deals are highly accretive to our shareholders, okay? We might do something like that. But that's not going to be major, it's not going to be big numbers.
Brian P. McKeon: Yes. And as we talked in our announcement, over time, we think it will make sense to operate at lower level -- leverage levels. And so equity may be part of our future plans, but it's not a requirement for us to get into the structure. We're well positioned to get to -- to fund that conversion.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I mean, one of the things, obviously -- I mean, I know the economy hasn't been helpful in this in terms of the service revenues always consistently being a pain in your side every quarter. Is there any light at the end of the tunnel in terms of what turns that around or in terms of just finally reaching such easy comps that it doesn't get any worse?
C. Richard Reese: Well, I think we're seeing that's an area of North America. And the decline rates are slowing, okay? And it'll drift in the right space there. And it's hard to know what -- where Europe is going, I mean, quite candidly. But Europe does not -- we don't have quite the risk profile in Europe. Our business there is much less active in the physical side, because we don't have a big medical business. And still the #1 driver of that decline is a health care trend. It's not the economy. The economy is the second driver of that decline. And which is, primarily in North America, an issue totally. So the fact that we don't have the big driver in healthcare will mean it's not going to impact us that much. It's likely be on the margin kind of stuff.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then just one quick question, too, in -- part of the margin improvement in North America, you've mentioned in the press release the lower occupancy cost. Is that because you're already starting to consolidate some facilities there? Or is it just lower lease cost and lower property values, et cetera?
Brian P. McKeon: We're always working to optimize the utilization our network. We have improved that a bit. And I think that's reflective of the work that we're doing on that front, as well as utility cost. I think we're down a bit as well in the quarter. But it does reflect the work that we're doing to optimize the real estate.
C. Richard Reese: So thank you very much for giving us this hour. We appreciate your support and so forth. As we did mention earlier, we will be out. There's 1 more -- 1 or 2 more conferences we'll be at. We'll be at the Barclays Conference in a few weeks in New York. Next week, they're telling me. I got to look at my calendar more carefully, I guess. But we are driving towards an Investor Day in October, and we'll be out shortly with a precise date and location, so hopefully you can put it in your calendar. We would expect at that Investor Day to talk quite a bit about what we see forward, finishing out our 3-year plan. I think we've started about 18 months ago making sure you see that we're on track there. We'll expect to be talking a little bit about how we're going to build a more durable business. Hopefully, give you -- likely give you some access to some of the key managers that are doing it. And then, of course, we will be talking not about the REIT process, because we'll be in the middle of it. We won't know anything, and if we did, we wouldn't tell you anyway. We will be talking about, though, what Iron Mountain might look like as a REIT a bit more than we have and so forth. So I think you'll hopefully find that a useful time to come and spend a morning or so with us. Again, thank you, and we hope you will all have a good summer. And we'll see you later.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-04-26 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Stephen P. Golden - Vice President of Investor Relations C. Richard Reese - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Executive Vice President
Analysts: Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Operator: Good morning. My name is Anita, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q1 2012 Earnings Call Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Golden, you may now begin your conference.
Stephen P. Golden: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our 2012 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me this morning are Richard Reese, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian McKeon, our Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for your questions. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2012 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures, as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. With that, I would like to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Richard Reese.
C. Richard Reese: Thank you, Stephen, and good morning. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. As you've seen from our press release this morning, our business performance is really pretty clean and as we forecasted, and since we spoke about our business to you only about 2 months ago, maybe with a little luck, this call may be shorter than usual. But we'll get started, and let's see where it takes us. But before we get started and deep dive into the business, I want to update you on the status of our special committee work. The progress is ongoing, and we will meet our commitment to report the Board's conclusions and rationale for its conclusions no later than June 9. Since we're close to reaching a conclusion, we will not be entertaining any questions on this topic today or in any future meeting until we come forth with the final answers. So having said that, I realize that may disappoint some of you, but we are getting down to the short strokes, and we're going to have to keep anything close to our vest, and I realize many of you will try to ask questions or want to ask questions to try to get some insight to how we're thinking about it, but we're just going to have to be pretty disciplined and basically, we're not going to answer them. So just be prepared for this. One year ago, I returned as CEO, and we announced the new 3-year plan, which was focused on driving returns on capital and returning capital in excess of that required to operate our strategy to you, our shareholders. We have made excellent progress in all fronts. At the time, I committed to giving you a report card on our progress against our plan, and since we are one year from announcement and nearly halfway through execution, I'll review our progress on this plan and its impact on our business.  But before I do that, let me make a few comments on the quarter. As I said in the beginning, performance showed consistent trends. We operated as planned. Total revenue on a constant dollar basis grew at 1%, and adjusted OIBDA grew at 2%. Without the impact of the declining in recycled paper prices we've been speaking to you about for a couple of quarters, total revenue would have been up 2%, and adjusted OIBDA of up 4%, as paper is a 1% drag on revenue growth and a 2% drag on adjusted OIBDA. FX is a 1% drag on both of those, by the way. Our team is executing well, and the underlying business trends are consistent with what we've seen over the past several quarters. We continue to focus on sustaining our annuity revenue stream driven by storage over the long-term and believe that we can maintain a low single-digit growth rate in annuity revenues over the long-term even in the face of the secular trends on the activity and use of physical information. Storage growth was up 3% in constant dollars for the quarter. This is 2% coming out of North America. International had a very strong 7% constant dollar storage growth. And as you know, storage is the annuity flywheel. It is the foundation of our business. It is -- out of that is what's all good things are derived because it's the beginning of the relationship and the center of the relationship with our customers and then also drives the majority of our margins. Storage gains were partially offset by a service revenue decline of 2% in constant dollars. Activity trends remain the same. Our core service where these activity trends are shown, though was a positive 1% in constant dollars. Activity-based core service revenues were down moderately in North America and consistent with the past. But this impact was offset by strong international gains and by strong global growth in hybrid revenues. Comp services were down 9%. This is driven primarily by paper, which was down 31% on a price basis for the quarter from last year. And paper is expected to remain a headwind throughout the year. Paper -- the impact of paper though, is partially offset by some improvement in project revenues and some of our other core service lines. Profit's performance was strong for the quarter. Adjusted OIBDA margins were up 40 basis points. International adjusted OIBDA increased 15% on constant currency basis with margins up 200 basis points. And I'll talk more about this later. North America did as we asked and sustained their strong margins even in a headwind of some mix of businesses and recycled paper prices being down. As you know, it's a very strong margin business, at 41% adjusted OIBDA margins. So Q1 was a good start for the year and in our business, if you start behind in the beginning, it's almost impossible to make it up, but if you get off to a good start, the year looks pretty good. And we remain optimistic for the year because we've had a good start. So now let me shift gears and talk to you a little bit about this strategic plan and where it's leading us, and so forth. As I said one year ago, we announced the 3-year strategic plan and made certain commitments to you. 2011 was the first year of the operating plan, and it runs through 2013. And the strategy featured 3 key elements: First is a refocus on our traditional physical storage and services business, which was primarily impacted in North America. And as you know, we sold our digital services business to Autonomy for $390 million last year. In North America, which is our largest business, our plan is and remains to be to build out on our market leadership position and to invest to sustain this business for the long term. It has a consistent storage growth of about 2%, sustained strong margins of 41% and good capital efficiency delivering an after-tax return on invested capital of about 15%. This is a high return business and our goal is optimize it by investing for sustainability. Continuous margin expansion is offsetting service headwinds and funding incremental investments in support of the annuity. In 2011, we increased sales and marketing investment by about approximately $20 million. It takes time for an increase in investment of this type to share results, but we believe we're seeing a return on investment in excess to 15% on our sales and marketing investments. We're seeing a slight uptick in unit growth, the storage on the margin and expansion of other services helping offset the core service trends. We've shown that if we can increase the input investment, we can get a good return. And we'll likely make several investments from time to time in the future where we see a clear path to returns. Additionally, one change we're seeing in North America since we announced our plan is an increase in acquisition opportunities that we may take advantage of from time to time. We have a particularly strong network to acquire into and realize significant synergies from and therefore, great returns on invested capital. We will be disciplined as we look at these opportunities, and they will all be return on investment capital-focused, not "strategic".  Now let me shift and talk about the second leg of our strategy, which was our International business, where our focus is on driving returns from our previous investments. We have the leading information and management services company internationally. The business has good growth, currently 7% storage, and which is the foundation and 5% total. And our portfolio as a whole, achieved good returns beating our hurdle rates through our work we did last year. We built this business using footprint strategy to acquire critical mass for customer coverage and to expand our access to future high-growth markets. In doing so, we have a mix of businesses on our portfolio with varying levels of performance, and as part of our strategic plan, when it took -- undertook a strategic review of all of our business units and developed strategies to drive returns based upon certain criteria.  Our analysis show that being a market leader is the key to driving great returns. In our International markets, where we have a leadership position, which is the majority of our markets, our margins and return on invested capital are in line with those of North America. Our analysis also showed that in 8 markets where we are not leaders, we need to develop plans to improve performance and drive returns up. For 6 of those 8 markets, France, Germany, Spain, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore, we have plans that are already bearing fruit, and we'll be bringing them in line with our expected returns by 2013. And in 2 markets, New Zealand and Italy, we decided to exit, and we're executing on that strategy, one we've completed and the other, we've almost completed.  The last category in our portfolio is the BRIC markets, where we currently have small but fast-growing businesses. We expect to invest to achieve market leader position where we can do so at attractive prices. More on this in a minute. The International business portfolio performed very well with strong margin accretion of 200 basis points in Q1. This is on top of 220 basis points of margin accretion last year, and puts us on target to get the 700 basis points of improvement we planned for by 2013. Last year, the focus and the margin accretion came primarily, the 220 basis points, out of the optimization of our biggest International business, the U.K. This year, the focus is in Western Europe and Latin America, where we're taken the same playbooks we used in North America, and exported those to the U.K., and now exporting those into LatAm and Western Europe, and it's already showing great results, as I said it, 200 basis points in Q1 of this year. So we're off to a good start on the International, and we're on track for the full year there also.  As I've said, investing in high-growth markets to achieve market leadership is a key component of our International strategy as market leadership drives returns. Consistent with this strategy, we acquired Grupo Store based in São Paulo, Brazil in April. The purchase price is approximately $80 million, and this is a business with approximately $30 million in revenue growing at double digits. It's a good, solid, clean business with great fold-in synergies with our existing platform in Brazil, which we will realize over time. We're breakeven for -- on this on this business on a contribution basis in 2012 due to integration costs, but we expect over the 24- to 36-month timeframe to see this to drive great returns. It has strong revenue growth, and expected post-integration margin expansions will help us drive both strong continued growth and returns beyond this year. When combined with our existing business in Brazil, we will become the market leader in this important emerging market. It's a large market, already estimated to be approximately $1 billion market potential. There's a very active group of competitors pushing the outsourcing conversion trend. We estimate that even with this consolidation of these 2 businesses and the market leadership position, that we have less than 10% share of market, so there remains lots of room for us to continue double-digit growth. And as the market leader, we expect this trend to double-digit growth to continue for quite a long time, and we expect to generate the kinds of returns that the market leadership generate for us and the rest of the world and Brazil over time. You are likely to see us do more international acquisitions of this nature. As I said, the goal is where we can find good, clean businesses and strong growing markets and help us solidify -- based upon our past work, consolidate and solidify the #1 market leadership position and drive returns. We will take the opportunity to do so. So again, great progress on the strategy and a really good move on the part of our International team. And I think you're going to like what happens there over the long period of time. The third element of our strategy was a focus on capital allocation. We've committed to return $2.2 billion over 3 years with $1.2 billion coming in the first year. We met that first $1.2 billion commitment with April's dividend payment. This first phase was -- consisted of $1 billion of stock buybacks that we executed, as well as about $200 million in dividends. We are committed to strategy to return the excess capital to shareholders as efficiently as possible, and through the special committee, the Board process, we examine most effective ways to do so. And as I said, we will have more to say on these subjects before June 9. So in summary, we're off to a good start on our 3-year plan. But as with most plans, this one will not exactly unfold as expected. Lower paper prices, some divestitures and lower service revenues will reduce our expected revenues and OIBDA in 2013 versus the plan. Acquisitions and other positive trends will likely add to the plan. But we expect that the fundamentals of improved operating margins internationally and greater capital efficiency will remain a core part of our plan and our reported performance. So let me reflect for a second. As I said, we introduced this 3-year plan, approximately a year ago now. It was last April when, as you know, I came out of semi-retirement and came back to the company. And we looked to refocus the company back to its core. And so let me reflect a little bit on that job. I'm very pleased how the business and the organizations have responded in the last year. The business is becoming more and more focused on the core, and more and more focused on driving returns of invested capital out of those core businesses. We have significant opportunity ahead of us. I mean, it's not for a lack of opportunity that we're doing this focus. It's to make sure that we can really be disciplined to execute against this opportunity. And I personally remain very optimistic about the future, which I predict will be dominated by 2 key themes, one is investments to sustain this wonderful annuity business, which has a great return on capital, and to do so over a long period of time. To me, the key is durability or sustainability of the business, and we believe that we have the tools, the capital and the opportunity set to do that. And if we do that well, we will be returning significant capital with our shareholders on a very consistent basis, over a very long period of time. So as we've shifted our focus on returns, it is clear that though that we should fight the urge to be too greedy. Our market leader businesses are all great return businesses that we want to optimize for the long-term. By driving to even higher margins -- but driving for even higher margins is really not the answer. We need to continue to drive costs down and reinvest those savings for long-term sustainability, and we have an opportunity set that will allow us to accomplish that if we invest correctly. And I think we have the talent to be able to do so. The emerging market businesses and even the non-leader markets that we now remain in, will improve out over time and produce a balance of more growth and better returns. Personally, I wish I were younger and had the opportunity to play off the next phase of the life of Iron Mountain. I see nothing but great opportunity in its future. But of course, I'm not. We have an active search for CEO. We're getting great candidates, but it's not a process to be rushed. This is a great opportunity and we want to find the right leader that can balance the needs of all of our constituents, you, our shareholders, our customers and of course, our employees over the very long period of time.  As I have often said and many of you shareholders said, one of the real great things about Iron Mountain is not only the annuity business model but this ability to drive this annuity and sustain it over an extremely long period of time. As you know, we spent a lot of capital to build the flywheel, to build the annuity. As I said, this next phase is about having net capital come back out of the business and back to our shareholders. And of course, the longer we can foresee doing that, the much more valuable the company is. When I returned last year, I did state that I expected to be here for 12 to 24 months. We're about halfway through my estimated timeframe, and I expect that I'll meet my original target. But I want to make sure you all know that I remain committed to the company until we find the right leadership for the long-term. But stay tuned as we get closer, we'll talk to you more about where the next phase may be in that area. So with that, let me turn it over to Brian and then we'll take your questions and answers.
Brian P. McKeon: Thanks, Richard. Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's financial review. We delivered solid performance in Q1, in line with our plans, reflecting consistent business trends. Our financial results were again, supported by solid storage revenue growth and strong performance in our International business. Reported revenues for Q1 were $746 million, up 1% on a constant currency basis as 3% storage gains were offset by moderate service declines, including the impact of lower recycled paper prices. Profit performance was in line with our expectations, with results supported by strong gains in our International segment and sustained high margins in North America.  Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $221 million, up 2% on a constant currency basis. International adjusted OIBDA margins increased by 200 basis points to -- compared to Q1 of 2011, keeping us on track to achieve our margin improvement goal of 700 basis-point improvement by the end of 2013. Adjusted EPS was $0.29 in Q1, and reported EPS was $0.35 including the impact of foreign exchange gains and discrete tax items. We continue to expand our International business while driving higher returns, consistent with our 3-year strategic plan. Adjusted OIBDA in the International segment increased 15% on a constant currency basis in Q1, supported by strong growth in emerging markets and benefits from cost improvement initiatives in Latin America and Western Europe.  As Richard noted, we recently acquired Grupo Store in Brazil, which will position us well to build on this momentum. We're off to good start to the year and are on track towards our full year financial goals. Today, we're reiterating our full year 2012 outlook and adding the impact to the recently completed store acquisition for the balance of the year. We continue to plan for 1% to 3% internal growth excluding the effect of lower paper prices and constant currency adjusted OIBDA gains of 1% to 5% x paper impacts. The store acquisition will add $25 million to revenues and $5 million in CapEx for the remaining 3 quarters of 2012. Adjusted OIBDA gains from this acquisition will be offset by integration costs in 2012. Let's now turn to Slide 4 and review our financial results in more detail. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the first quarter of 2011. As noted, Q1 results were as expected and consistent with recent operating trends. Enterprise revenue growth was flat year-on-year as 1% constant dollar gains were offset by unfavorable year-on-year foreign exchange impacts. Overall revenue performance reflected sustained storage revenue internal growth of 3%, global expansion of hybrid services and higher project revenues. These gains were offset by moderate declines in North America, activity-based core service activities and lower recycled paper revenues.  From a segment perspective, North America posted flat constant currency revenue growth. Consistent 2% storage internal growth was offset by a 3% decline in service revenues, including the impact of lower paper prices. Service growth continues to be constrained by reduced retrievable and refile, transportation and data protection handling activity. These impacts, along with lower recycled paper revenues, more than offset strong gains and hybrid revenues, increased project revenues and benefits from higher fuel surcharges. Our International segment posted 5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis, supported by a 7% storage growth reflecting sustained growth in Europe and continued double-digit gains in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. These gains were again augmented by strong hybrid revenues which offset impacts from lower paper prices and lower revenues from product sales and shredding services. Gross profit was $431 million in Q1, yielding a gross margin of 57.8%, up slightly compared to the same prior year period. Storage gross margins increased 240 basis points driven by lower occupancy costs. Service gross margins were down year-on-year due to decreased recycled paper revenues, the previously disclosed reclassification of certain overhead expenses to cost of sales, and the growth of relatively lower margin businesses including our hybrid services. Adjusted OIBDA was $221 million or 29.5% of revenues, up 40 basis points compared to Q1 2011. Sustained high margins in North America and continued strong performance in our International business were key components of the year-on-year margin expansion. Included in adjusting OIBDA is approximately $2 million related to the work of the special committee of the Board. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.29 per share. Reported earnings per share of $0.35 include a $3 million of other income and the impact of a lower effective tax rate due to foreign currency gains and discrete tax items. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 39% as expected. Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by a major service line, as well as the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and FX, compared to our full year expectations. Our internal growth rates for the first quarter were within our expected full year ranges supported by consistent 2% core revenue internal growth. As noted, storage internal growth remains solid at 3%. North America reported consistent 2% internal storage growth, and International storage internal growth remained strong at 6%. Net global Records Management volume was up more than 1% on a year-on-year basis in Q1, reflecting continued strong gains in International and flat year-on-year growth in North America. Pricing trends remain consistent. Total service internal growth was minus 2% or down about 1%, excluding impacts from commodity changes. These results are also consistent with underlying trends in recent quarters. Core service internal growth was flat in the quarter, as strong growth in hybrid services and benefits from higher fuel surcharges offset moderate declines in activity-based core service revenues. Complementary service revenues, which represent about 11% of total revenues, decreased 9% internally. Results were impacted by, as expected, by declines in recycled paper revenues reflecting substantially lower recycled paper pricing, as well as lower revenues in our fulfillment business. Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our segment results. Slide 6 shows key metrics for each of our 3 segments compared to the first quarter of 2011. Consistent with our 3-year strategic plan, we're sustaining high returns in our North America segment and building momentum in our International segment, as a significant driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. In Q1, our North American business segment reported revenues of $552 million and sustained adjusted OIBDA margins of 41%. While storage revenue gains remained solid at 2%, overall North America growth was constrained by lower service revenues including the impact of lower recycled paper prices.  We continue to drive operational improvements in North America to offset these impacts and maintain our high returns in this business. Our International segment continues to post solid constant dollar revenue growth and strong adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. As noted, adjusted OIBDA increased 15% excluding FX impacts, yielding 200 basis points of margin expansion. We're benefiting from the expansion of operational excellence initiatives in markets like Latin America, and from cost improvement initiatives in Western European markets as part of our portfolio improvement plan. Benefits from these initiatives and from continued solid growth across our International business is keeping us on track towards our business plan goals of 25% margins in 2013. Corporate expenses were consistent with prior year levels including $2 million of costs related to the work of the special committee. Overall, we're delivering consistent solid operating performance across our business, which is driving sustained strong cash flow. This performance is supporting significant shareholder payouts. Let's turn to Slide 7 to review our stockholder payout program. Slide 7 shows the substantial progress we've made in returning funds to stockholders over the past 2 years. Since first announcing our plans to return cash to shareholders in February of 2010, we returned $1.4 billion to stockholders through $300 million of dividend payments and the repurchase of 38 million shares for more than $1.1 billion. In Q1, we acquired 1.1 million shares for $35 million. Share repurchases to date, through this program, represent more than 18% of the shares we had outstanding at the end of 2009. As part of our 3-year strategic plan that we presented in April of 2011, we committed to $2.2 billion of payouts through 2013, including $1.2 billion by May 2012. We've completed our initial $1.2 billion commitment and we're well-positioned to continued advancement of shareholder payouts supported by our strong operating performance. We remain committed to driving strong cash flows and driving an optimal approach to our capital structure to support shareholder returns. Let's now turn to Slide 8 to review how we're managing our balance sheet to fund our business and drive our strategy. Strong consistent cash flow generation has enabled us to maintain a strong balance sheet while supporting substantial shareholder payouts. As planned, we recently increased our leverage by approximately 1/2 a turn in support of our payout program. Currently, our consolidated leverage ratio is 3.5x at the midpoint of our target 3x to 4x leverage range. We remain well-positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was more than $700 million with $178 million in cash and $529 million in additional borrowing capacity. Our debt portfolio at March 31, 2012 also remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate was down to 6.7%, and we were 80% fixed at quarter end. Maturity is more than 6 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. We're managing our balance sheet consistent with our 3-year plan, and we're well-positioned to fund our business strategy. That concludes our review for Q1 2012 results. Overall, we continue to drive solid financial performance, and we're on track to achieve our goals in 2012, as we continue to advance our 3-year plan.  Let's now turn to Slide 9 to review our 2012 outlook. Slide 9 summarizes our current 2012 outlook. Today, we're reiterating our full year 2012 financial guidance and adding the impact of the store acquisition in Brazil. As a result of the store acquisition, we're increasing our revenue outlook by $25 million. There will be no impact on adjusted OIBDA as operating profits will be offset by integration expenses in 2012. As noted, we're planning for consistent revenue growth trends excluding impacts from recent declines in recycled paper prices. Supported by consistent storage internal growth of about 3%, we're expecting constant dollar revenue growth of 2% to 4%, excluding paper.  As noted, our internal growth outlook x paper impacts remains at 1% to 3%. A 30% decline in paper prices compared to the average for 2011 and negative year-on-year impacts from foreign exchange is projected to reduce our reported growth to a range of minus 1% to plus 2%. Our outlook for constant currency adjusted OIBDA growth, excluding the impact of lower paper prices, remains between 1% and 5%. At current levels, lower paper prices are projected to have a negative 5% impact on our adjusted OIBDA growth this year. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.36 per share. Our calculation of adjusted EPS assumes the structural tax rate of 39% and 172 million shares outstanding. We're planning for capital spending of $220 million including $5 million associated with the store acquisition and about $25 million of spending for real estate. Our outlook is for free cash flow performance -- our outlook for free cash flow performance remains in the range of $320 million to $360 million including about $20 million of negative impacts this year from higher prior year capital spending accruals. Finally, based on our outlook for 2012, we expect our return on invested capital to be in the range of 11%. In summary, Q1 as was another quarter of solid financial performance and we're on track to achieve our financial goals for 2012. We continue to execute against our 3-year plan, completing our $1.2 billion payout commitment, sustaining high profits and cash flow in North America and driving strong growth and higher returns in our International business. And we're well-positioned to build on this progress. Thanks, and we'd now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I want to ask about core services. We're flat now. We've been flat for 2 quarters. The forecast for the year is unchanged at negative 4 to 0. I surely heard that you had a couple of things moving around there and that activities, meaning moving boxes around, is still dead, at least in North America. But why after being flat this quarter and flat in the fourth quarter, is the forecast for the year kind of unchanged to be -- being 0 to minus 4? The very least, you would feel better about the high end of that.
Brian P. McKeon: Well, as you know, it's early in the year, Andrew, and we are within the range. I think there is always noise on those type of numbers at the margin. As Richard said, we're off to a good start to the year. We feel good about the track that we're on and...
C. Richard Reese: We don't like to predict things we don't see for sure either, Andrew, but basically, we didn't focus on making a change there. It's in the range.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. And maybe let me just ask the question one more time. Is the flat, the 0, more a function of how strong hybrid is? Or has there been some improvement, meaning less negative in terms of moving stuff around?
Brian P. McKeon: A couple of things. We're getting about 1 point benefit from fuel surcharges. It helps a little bit. The -- it's more similar trends than different trends. I think our International business is doing well, and I think the activity trends in International are relatively stronger than what we've seen in North America. I think North America has been a very similar place. We do record, as you know, some of the hybrid revenues through the -- we record some of that in our core service, the more recurring nature where we have more recurring projects, and that's a double-digit growth. We're doing very well on that front. So that's [indiscernible]. But on balance, more similar than different, but I think we do have some positives.
C. Richard Reese: And Andrew, the International business is much less of its portfolio has any in healthcare in it. And healthcare is the major drag factor in North America.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of James Samford with Citigroup.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I just wanted to, I guess if I could just follow-up on that a little bit. If you could just sort of frame the activity cycle in terms of the macro environment, I'm just sort of curious whether activity internationally is a function of -- if there's a lot of changes going on there and that's sort of driving activity levels. I just want to sort of frame it on from a macro perspective.
C. Richard Reese: Yes. Look, no. I think International is more driven by the 7% storage growth, and that drags along with it more services. Newer records are far more active, and they age fairly quickly in terms of activity patterns. So the faster you grow on them, the greater the amount of newer records you got, and therefore the more active they are. And plus part of that activity is the charges of bringing things in, so if you're growing faster, you got more service activity to assess or bring things in. No, I don't think it's an economic impact. Although services have -- do respond to the economy quicker than storage. Storage growth is a real lag on an economic rebound. And like in North America, we've seen no real clear trends in the economy. And we expect to be an 18-month or so lagger there. On services, we would pick up a little faster.
Brian P. McKeon: What's tough for us parse, too, is just obviously, the first quarter in North America, you had better weather. And I think when weather is bad, you hear about the negative side of it. When it's good, no one's saying that's helping to support performance. But that could be at the margin. Something is helping us a bit. I don't -- to Rich's point, I don't think we've seen kind of a change in the economic environment. It's more reflective of kind of what's going on underlying it.
James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And just a quick follow up on -- it looks like volume growth picked up a little bit here. You got stabilization on the output and distractions. I think the organic piece, is that International organic? Or how should we think about sort of the mix of volume growth on the Records Management side?
Brian P. McKeon: It's very, again, very similar. I think you're looking at our encashment where we show kind of the quarterly numbers annualized. It's very similar in the U.S., kind of flat volume trends. We're seeing benefits from the sales and marketing initiatives that we advanced and that's helping us to stabilize the incoming volume, which was down a bit. And now, it's more in the stable zone in which we feel very good about. And international is in a similar zone of solid growth. There is some seasonality in the quarterly numbers. We do tend to see more add lots in the first quarter, and so when you seasonal-ize those numbers, that's part of the dynamic you see there, but it's a similar trend. We feel good that we've moved from where we had more pressure on our growth to where we're more stable and seeing positive flowthrough from some of the investments, and looking forward to building on that.
C. Richard Reese: And that we spoke a little bit about the investment sales and market. It's a long cycle to see it come through. But we're seeing better performance. We're seeing better pipeline growth. We're seeing better conversion ratios. We're seeing a variety of things that make us feel like we've kind of pulled out of the bottom and we started back in another direction. But it's very, very slow cycle. And I really caution people that this is not a business that you can take sort of a data point and sort of draw line up or line down. It's a flywheel, it takes a while that move either way. But I think we feel like it's moving in a better direction now than it was moving in say, a year's plus or so ago. But I would -- again caution you, don't go re-forecasting things. You'll be absolutely wrong.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Richard, did you tend to talk about a kind of a longer-term trend on the storage side in terms of revenue growth? And was it low single-digits, or was that within storage itself? Or just -- can you put some context around that?
C. Richard Reese: Yes. What I'm really saying is I think we can keep our business overall growing in those ranges but build on a foundation of storage, annuity-based kinds of businesses in effect. And we're going through some shifts and changes. We've talked about healthcare restructuring itself. Look our healthcare business is growing, but the big service component is coming out of it, it was our most active business. It will take a while take for them to absorb. I know people believe that, that foreshadows what's going happen in the rest of the market. They're wrong. Not that -- we have records aren't going to get less active. Like we've announced, we have been doing that for 30 years, and they will for over the next 30, 40 years. But not at the same pace as healthcare. But we've got those headwinds, and those headwinds of healthcare will take a while for us to eat through, but we've got a bunch of other positive things and we got some new things in the hopper. And if we look out over the long haul, and we've done quite a bit of work on this and look at a very long period of time, what we're saying is we believe net-net, we have the opportunity set, and we have the tools, staying within our core business, not going throwing big, long passes or anything. Staying with that core business to keep the core -- keep our business, all annuity-based by and large, growing in the low single-digits. And that's why we talk a lot about confidence around the ability to sustain the flywheel and sustain the cash generation capabilities of the business.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Understood. And then just -- it seems like on a relative basis, acquisitions are starting to pick up a little bit. Is that just purely opportunity? Kind of how you're feeling about the business overall? Or just any thoughts on that?
C. Richard Reese: I have been saying around here for a couple of years that we're going to see -- if we're going to see another mini consolidation wave in North America and like everything else I predicted, it takes a long time for it to happen. That's our business. It's starting to happen. That is the nature in North America of just the -- the impact of the first consolidation wave was to consolidate the market, create a bunch of new competitors. Now, there's new competitors. We have a reasonable number of them. I have been out there a while, invested capital for a long time, and looking to monetize. It's just the cycle. I think we'll go through that cycle again. And we will play that opportunity cycle because unlike the last time when we were a driver of that cycle, we were building footprint. This time, we're not building footprint. We're building returns, and we're going to do it by -- if it's a great consolidation economics and it's a good, clean business, in a fair price to both parties, we'll do it. If it's not, we'll pass on it. And so on, okay? But we are in the market. But we want to make sure the market hears us that way, and if anybody's interested in selling, you can get my phone number, you know how to call, we'll talk to you. Now that's North America. International, although in certain parts of International, there's some of that same dynamic but a much smaller scale. The other part of International, it's about us being a bit more targeted around our strategy that says market leadership. Where we -- where there are great markets particularly those with lots of growth left. And yes, I've spoken before and now a lot of the emerging markets have a 20, 20 to 30-year cycle just like the North American and the mature European markets went through, of the one-time outsourcing decision that for customers to accumulate their existing records, to get it organized and move from inside to outside. That's the kind of a once-in-a-lifetime decision. And during that cycle, it takes a long time. It took us over 30 years in North America to physically move all those records and we only about halfway through it, okay. But that long cycle in the emerging markets and a good part of the International places like Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia and so forth, is a very large business opportunity for us. And so we want to be market leaders in a good part of that space. We have leadership but quite a bit of it, but there are places where we don't. Brazil was a good example. And so internationally, we would be more targeted towards finding those place we can go ahead and achieve leadership, get to scale and ride that outsourcing conversion curve and then what we've been able to do on North America, build great returns and much bigger businesses. The International play gets a lot better over time. It just takes time for it to grow because each of those countries -- it's not like a foreign company -- country operation is not analogous to a city in North America. It's got a different overhead structure. It's got a different cultural bias. It's got a different way of selling. It's got variations. And the bigger you get, the better you get at adapting to those variations, the more efficient you get. There's just a lot of positive things come out of it. And like [indiscernible] fill out in our business, that takes patience. But now that we've done our portfolio review, we're in good shape. We're just going to keep adding to it. And so net-net, North America is more opportunistic strategy where the returns make sense. International is a more strategic M&A strategy where it is about driving leadership to drive returns.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Understood. And then just one final, if I could? Within the context of overall capital return, kind of M&A versus kind of dividend and buyback in aggregate, out of 100%, how would that play out over the next couple of years?
C. Richard Reese: Well, you're really talking the capital allocation strategy going forward, and I'm not going to comment on that because that just gets wrapped up into the whole issue of what we do next. And so we'll talk about that sometime between now and June 9.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: As I was going through the 10-K, one thing jumped out that maybe I'm making too big a deal out of. But it was interesting to me that on your cash flow statement, the portion of the customer acquisition costs that you capitalize, that addition to customer relationship/acquisition cost line, it was larger in absolute terms than as a percent of revenue, than any point is better in the last 10 years, and yet -- revenue growth is pretty slow. I guess I wondered, is this may be another sign that the sales investments you've done are working? Or is there something that's changed that would be driving that, maybe like higher customer turnover, but you're doing a better job of adding to offset that or something?
Brian P. McKeon: We have a lot of tools in terms of how we build new business and in some cases, we will acquire business, what we call a pick-up-and-moves. So basically, we're acquiring businesses from competitors without necessarily taking the real estate...
C. Richard Reese: You'd be buying a portfolio of customers basically, and moving them into existing sites.
Brian P. McKeon: And that is an area where it's a similar judgment in terms of deploying capital and looking at returns, and we've had opportunities on their front, and that is an area that we'll continue to deploy to grow as well. And we understand the economics of those types of investments very, very well as you might imagine because it's clearly defined. And we can swab that into areas where we have excess capacity and help to manage our facility utilization. So that's what it's reflective of.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then, I was thinking back to, I guess now, 1.5 year ago, your last investor day, and I remember one of the themes of that, that was a focus on where you could be more targeted in trying to get pricing? Has there been any change in that? Or is it sort of the economy where it is, and not having gotten better enough, kept you from making any major moves towards that strategy you talked about?
C. Richard Reese: Well, we restructured pricing in not all of our business, but a reasonable amount of our business in over the last say, 3 years or so, where we went to more list price and then discount off a list and try to rationalize pricing, and looked across the board at the value proposition, and so forth. That would be the sort of the, what you might call a big move in effect of things. And since then, if you think about it, we have a significant part of our revenue where it's a sort of on an annual cycle and we're going through those annual increases. But we also have a significant part of revenue that's on multi-year contracts that are indexed by-and-large, one way or the other inflation. But in the last few years, those indexes have been down and so that puts a limit on just the natural limit on price. The flip side of it is, if you believe we will see inflation in the future, we'll be well-protected on the way back up. So...
Brian P. McKeon: Strategically, we're increasing our focus on being more segmented in our offering by a customer vertical and looking across the scope of the services that we offer and linking that into our pricing strategy. So I think we're looking for ways to increase the value that we bring to customers and capture that through the pricing strategies. That's really the next wave. Building on what Richard said, I think we've got a very good foundational structure for how we approach pricing and are advancing the same strategy, and trying to look at ways to increase our value add through segmented approaches to growth. And that will be the next wave and where we might be able to get some incremental value out of our pricing approach.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just one last one. Everybody's noticed that Brambles didn't sell recall at the price or the timing they wondered -- they wanted to. I wondered if you had any comment if that would be something that might make sense as something for Iron Mountain to look at? Or maybe would be willing to say if you have not really been involved in that or not?
C. Richard Reese: We have not been in the process. I think, it was Brambles' choice. It's not that we wouldn't have been interested in looking because we would have. If I think for their own reasons, and probably good reasons, they chose that -- not to bring us into the process. So we're are sitting on the sidelines and watching like everybody else.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird & Co.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I'm just curious on the pick-up-and-moves. I'm just curious if you can just talk about, quantify how much of the volume growth you're seeing is as a result that today, and given that it just sounds like this is a little bit of a shift there, and kind of what was it maybe a few years ago?
Brian P. McKeon: You said a relatively similar range. I think it's less than 1% on the margin. I do think we're increasing our focus across a number of areas, including acquisitions in terms of growth. But I don't think it's a fundamental change from where we've been. We'll take a closer look at that. But it does go up and down depending on the nature of the opportunities that are out there. And I think we've seen a better pipeline more recently. This just tie into some of the themes that's Richard's talking about with -- in North America, more things being available for sale. This is a -- in many ways, a different form of the sale for smaller businesses.
C. Richard Reese: And we -- as we go forward, we will use various tools that keep the drive and the sustainability of the business. As a company, the theme we said is, for this year and for our 3-year plan, is to refocus back on our core physical business. The reason we stated it that way is, looking prior to that, and it's not that we lost focus on the business, but there's a few tools we had put down and just weren't using, and this is one of them. We just -- we were not looking at any form or fashion to speak of -- particularly North America, the opportunity set that came up. And so we're just opening up and looking at those sort of things.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Makes sense. And just on the service business, Richard, are there any knobs that you have on your arsenal to maybe induce some level services there? Is there a pricing strategy that maybe lines up the marginal costs and marginal revenues there better? Or is there anything you're doing today to maybe offset some of the headwinds you're seeing there?
C. Richard Reese: There are some new services that we have introduced, and they're getting traction. But like everything, they take a long time. I mean, that's the good and bad side of our business. What I'm -- for example in the healthcare space is an approach to pathology customers. It's -- we've repackaged and come up with a better value proposition, and we're getting good traction on it. But it takes a few years before you see any major impact under that. So we're doing things like that, and it's more about the theme of vertical-izing our services and being much more specific around specific industry needs. And we had some other new service programs or new product programs related to our core in what I'd call beta phases. We're not going to pound a table on them for a while until they turn real, but yes, some of them look very promising, and some could be substantial big businesses over time. And so rather than coming out and hyping them, what we're going to do is go through some betas and get into the markets a little bit. And when we have some real results that's significant, we'll come back to talk to you about them, and so forth. And that's all part of us maturing as a company, learning how to look across our own customer base, and we've been evolving those skills in project management-type skills, and so forth, to be able to verticalize, to be able to be more creative and look for opportunity sets and custom-design what we do and then repeat it over and over, and so forth. And we're getting better at that. We'll have to keep getting better at it, and that's where a reasonable amount of money has been invested in the last few years, and I think we'll continue doing that.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And then just kind of another one, just touching on -- in your sales process here a little bit. On the digital business, it's been out of your portfolio now for a while. Can you talk a little bit about kind of how the new relationship with your digital vendors is going, maybe what you've learned from that process? And maybe Brian, can you give us -- or quantify how much of revenue we're seeing today from you selling digital services that are not assets or technologies that you own?
Brian P. McKeon: That's a small number.
C. Richard Reese: It's a small number. We -- because we shifted 100% of the sales force that sold the technology services, and chose not to rebuild that sales force. Having said that though, we are selling a lot more connected [indiscernible].
Brian P. McKeon: It's a very small number. Immaterial.
C. Richard Reese: And what we did was is -- frankly, at the request of my leadership in North America, they asked me to slow down on doing that. Not slow down on selling it per se, but on focus because what they found was that they really wanted to get their sales force refocused and requoted back towards the core business. We had -- the quarters in focusing on very much towards the new services side. And that's one of the reasons that storage started to come off and by refocusing and making people focused on going back and digging out the storage, they're doing it. We just didn't want to confuse people.
Brian P. McKeon: We continue to own in the intellectual property management business, which is a great business for us, and it's roughly $30 million of revenues. So that was part of the digital business that was doing well.
C. Richard Reese: And we've -- look, we were coming back. Some of those the beta services talking to you have a strong partner technology component potential. But we're going to take our time, and we're not going to spend a god-awful amount of money trying to do this stuff. So I think that's the last question, operator, in my understanding. So -- hey, I was right, we finished 5 minutes earlier, so that's a record for me. So thank you very much. As I said, the business is performing as we expected. We're off to a good start for the quarter, and hopefully, the rest of the calls this year will be equally good if not better, and so forth. We are really busy though. There's a lot going on between, I'd like to say looking at an acquisition pipeline and looking at -- and so forth. But the real focus of the, some of the organization, is on being prepared to have a conversation with you prior to June 9. And I know everybody's eager to hear us talk and we will be prepared, and we'll let you know, probably the day of or some number of, when we come forth and talk. So we look forward to talking to you again in the next couple of months. Thank you very much for your support, and we will talk to you later.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-02-23 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Stephen P. Golden - Vice President of Investor Relations C. Richard Reese - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Executive Vice President
Analysts: Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Operator: Good morning. My name is Anita, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q4 2011 Earnings Call Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host today, Stephen Golden, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.
Stephen P. Golden: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our 2011 fourth quarter earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Richard Reese, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian McKeon, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation at the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2012 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed current report on Form 8-K filed on September 19, 2011, for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. Before turning the call over to Richard, I would like to make a quick housekeeping announcement. As announced in this morning's press release, we have made a decision to sell our Italian business. As a result, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Italian business have been reclassified as discontinued operations. For your convenience, we have included the restated statements of operations for the 4 quarters and full years of both 2010 and 2011 in the appendix to today's presentation. Additional restated information will be posted to the Investor Relations page of our website. With that, I'd like to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Richard Reese.
C. Richard Reese: Thank you, Stephen. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us this morning. As always been my prior custom on these Q4 calls, I'm going to focus today on the full year mostly of 2011 and reflect a bit on all the changes and, for that matter, the progress we've made since I've returned as CEO this last April. It's been a lot of change in the company, and it's important that our shareholders understand these changes and, as I said, the progress we've made against them as we've set forth the new strategy and focusing our business. So I'll let Brian cover the details on the quarter, except to say that Q4 was a good operating performance. We had consistent storage growth and great cost controls. I'll also speak a little bit about our outlook for next year. But again, I'll let Brian take care of the details, and he'll go through everything thoroughly. So with that said, let me get started. Looking at the whole year on a performance basis, it was good performance for Iron Mountain. The key themes on an operating basis last year were, first and foremost, solid storage growth of 5% reported or 4% on constant currency. North America storage grew as we expected on a consistent 3% reported, 2% on a current basis -- or current constant currency basis, while International was strong at 14% reported or 9% on constant currency. And sometimes people ask me, and particularly, people haven't been around the company so long, why do we talk about storage so much? Why is it so important? Well, first is it is the major component of our revenue. It is the major driver of margin, and it frankly is the major consumer of capital as we grow. It is where we drive almost everything in the business. But it's also an indication of our relationship with our customers. Once they store items with us, it opens up the door for us to deliver other services on a routine basis related to those stored items, as well as sell them additional services or things we call complementary services and so forth. So we watch our storage foundation or annuity like a hawk. It is the flywheel that really drives the business. And 2011 was the 23rd consecutive year that we've grown our storage revenues, and through good times and bad, storage keeps chugging along with the business, and it's continuing do that. Now we are continuing to see the same trends we did throughout the year of headwinds that weakening service revenues as customers use less of their information. They're becoming less active, in certain cases, change the way they use and, in many cases, continue defer buying decisions for projects that really are designed to improve their records programs. The trend towards less activity of information was felt broadly across all industries and all media types, not just in paper but our computer tape rotation services. The activity levels are down. We see it down, as I said, across the board.  A key driver of this, as we've talked a lot about, is our health care, which is not a major factor in the storage side of our business, but it's also the most active part. It's really not an archival business. It's an active part. And this is the case where the health care industry is reengineering their workflow processes. This is a trend that's different than the last activity trend. This is a trend in which health care is changing modalities. They're changing how they operate, so digitizing images, going to MRIs and CAT scan modalities is replacing physical x-rays, which is one of our most active media. And of course, the adoption and broader adoption of electronic patient record systems will cause them to access their physical patient records less often. And we're seeing that trend. They don't destroy those records, and they actually do access them for different reasons, mostly around audit compliance and also a lot around research, where they really want to go back to the history of the record. But those trends, we've been seeing for quite a while now, and they continued and they continued. That was one of the themes of 2011. Another key theme of 2011 was the move of recycled paper prices. We experienced very high recycled paper prices, in fact, hit an all-time high during the year. Those prices have come down sharply most recently and hit bottom and, frankly, we believe, just beginning to stabilize. This trend was helpful to us in 2011 but does present a challenge in 2012, and we'll talk more about that later. All of this, really, was topped off by good underlying profit performance. Adjusted OIBDA margins were 31% for the year. International expanded their margins, which I'll speak much more about later. It's part of our 3-year plan. They went up 220 basis points, primarily coming out of the United Kingdom, and strong emerging market performance drove those margins. North America performed as we asked them to and sustained their margins. We had, as you know, had optimized that business in the last 4 or 5 years and increased margins by about 850 basis points. We are at the stage of that business where the real strategic goal is to maintain margins and maintain growth, and they did both last year, even after absorbing an investment that we've talked about throughout the year, the $20 million increase in our sales and marketing investment. And of course, we had very good cost control at our overhead or our cost at our corporate level, so all in all, the team did a superb job of operating the business and delivering great financial performance. These all numbers netted down to 24% growth in free cash flow dollars, starting with good operating performance, but also, it's our fifth consecutive year of improved capital efficiency, where CapEx for last year was 6.6% of revenue, down 130 basis points from the prior year. We also did get in that strong cash flow benefits from some cash timing that helped us, which you don't always see, as well as some tax incentives, too. Again, Brian will reflect on these in more details later. So as I said, last year was a good year operationally. But as I've said in the beginning, last year is hallmarked by changes, so let me talk a lot about that. First and foremost is my return as CEO. For most of you who probably know me, it was a job I held for, I don't know, 25, 26 years, something like that, and I'm in my 31st year, I think, with the company. I might be a little bit off on the math, but close, directionally close. Net of that says I'm getting old. But I had gone for the job of the Executive Chairman and replaced myself as the CEO. But for lots of reasons, including the good work done by my predecessor, the company was on a path to shift strategies, but frankly, it made sense for me to come back. And it was a bit prompted by you, our shareholders, as the company had lost touch with some of you, and frankly, I've not done an appropriate job communicating these changes in strategy that we were both contemplating and implementing and, for that matter, not implementing them fast enough to have us all aligned. So when I came back, I did a couple of things. We announced a new 3-year strategic plan, which I'm going to go through with you in a second and just update you, but also committed to much, much more frequent and much -- very open communication with our shareholder base. I believe I've lived up to my promise, and this is the case, so I have a request of you. If you disagree with me, I really would appreciate you letting me know, and I think on that call, I gave you my phone number. I'll give it to you again. It's (617) 535-4800. And this is a serious request because I'm attempting to do some things that I think are important for the company, important for our shareholders, and sometimes, you need feedback. So with that, let me also talk to you about our new strategy and our 3-year plan. As I said, when I -- we announced the plan, I said I would give you regular updates. We've been out on the road doing it. We've been doing it in our quarterly conference call. But let me look back in the plan now that's almost a year old and just review with you what I think is outstanding progress by the team.  The plan had 4 main elements. First was a focus on traditional physical storage and services business, the things that got us here, [indiscernible] got us to the dance. So as a net of that, we sold our Digital business in June for $390 million. It was a good transaction for us, and I think it clearly turned out to be a great transaction for Autonomy, the buyer. So I think we were all happy with the results of that. The second element of this strategy was a focus on return on invested capital. And to do that, we really looked at our business there in a couple of ways. First is we take it apart by segments. The North American segment, as I said, we had optimized that business, and so the whole strategy was sustain the high returns we had already created. And that was -- that plan is and remains to sustain their margin levels and continue to grow. And they grew at 2% and hit their margin targets for the year, as well as continue the improvement, invest in their own business. The real work was in International, and I have to say that the International management team, supported by people here at corporate and other parts of the world and, for that matter, some people in North America, everybody pulled together, and we really did some great work last year.  It really has kind of 2 key themes. The first theme was to look at our business as a portfolio rather than as a broad footprint strategy. We built it as a footprint strategy, which means we acquired operations in broad geographies, and we really want a path to fill out the footprint. And we frankly just had gotten to the point where it was time to stop and say, "All right, let's look at that footprint and understand what can be optimized, understand how we can drive returns and understand, in certain cases, whether what we bought makes sense or doesn't make sense." And we went through that portfolio analysis. That analysis is completed with the announcement today that we are going to place our Italian business on the market for sale, and we've started that process already, but it will, as I predict, will take some time.  But in the International business, as I said, we've gone through that review. We also exited our New Zealand business, sold it for $10 million. And as I said, we've announced the plan to sell Italy. The rest of our businesses, and we've divided them as we've talked about in the plan, in different categories for where they stand in terms of mature markets, emerging markets, whether we have leadership or non-leadership. Though the return profiles of those business all look good, the work we've been doing and the work we have done say that they all can perform very well for us, and so now it's about hard work of blocking and tackling to get this portfolio to continue to move forward. And for that matter, continue contributing growth and International did a great job on growth last year. And we expect -- if you look at this business, over the next 15 to 20 years, just to give you a broad view, is the last 20, 25 years in this business was driven primarily by North America going through an outsourcing trend, where legacy records and information moved from inside of companies to outside, to vendors like Iron Mountain. And even though there has been a consistent trend of reduction in use and activity of paper and creation, okay, over that time period, they've been a strong, steady growth in the business because of that conversion cycle. Being a very physical business, it takes a long time to make that happen. And by the way, that is not over in North America, but the denominator in North America, the size of the business is so large that -- and you can only sell so many, and you can only move so much in a year. We'll continue growing it, but it's not going to move the dial on growth rate. But International and, in particular, if you got to break International in a couple of components, there are more mature markets that look like -- and to that, look like North America, U.K. being a good example. And there are others who are maybe 10 years from looking like North America, but they will get there. But there are also markets, emerging markets as we broadly categorize them, and that would be in, obviously, BRIC, but it will also be in Eastern Europe and Latin America and places like that, where the markets have got 20 to 25 years of their pent-up demand of outsourcing, and those trends are beginning to happen. And we built the footprint so our strategy looking forward now that we have the portfolio in a position that we think is rationalized to continue to drive, to capture that conversion over the next 25 years, and that will be more and more contributor to Iron Mountain's growth in the future as we go forward. Obviously, it doesn't make sense to do that unless you're making money at it. And so the second big element of our strategic review, we said, "All right let's step back and look at that portfolio and put in the kind of programs and the kind of work we've done in North America to drive up their margins 850 basis points and drive up our International markets." And we set a target of 700 basis points, challenged the team and said, "By 2013, we want 700 basis points from you." And they rose to the occasion, made the commitment and then last year, delivered, I think, 220 basis points of that target and are on plan to do 150 to 200, give or take, this year and are working on their plans. And those plans are in the book, are in the bag. I mean, not that I've executed, but the plans are in the bag, and they're working on their plans for 2013. So I'm very pleased by the performance. I'm very pleased by how fast we were able to take that business and frankly, reveal the real value we created. It was a case where I personally never had a doubt about the value, but it's also a case, as what I said in the beginning up here, we had lost touch with you as our shareholders. We have not done a good job of showing it to you fast enough nor getting you to understand that it was there. I personally think we're doing a good job with that right now. I hope you do, too. Net of all that is International, based upon their strong growth and margin accretion, returns on invested capital grew up to 8% north of our weighted average cost of capital. So -- and we've got significant more to come. So I think it's a great story there. Now let me move on to the third element of the strategy. That element was a real strong focus on capital allocation. It's the right time in the company's life do that. This company was built as a capital consumer. We raised capital for many years in order to build out this global leadership of a great business. But you do that waiting for the day in which your capital needs are less than your capital generation and your capital capabilities, so to speak, and we've hit that inflection point. And so -- then it becomes, as you all know, the big argument of what are we going to do with it? Are we going to give it to you, or are we going to throw it away? And many of you worry that we, as management, will do stupid things and throw it away. Again, we probably didn't do a good enough job explaining to you that we weren't stupid. But -- and some of our performance, I can understand from your perspective, particularly on the Digital business, you were worried that we were going to do stupid things, that we were going to go spend billions of dollars buying technology assets. And regardless of what may have been said from time to time that might have given you that impression, the truth of matter is we look hard at all those opportunities and concluded that it did not make financial sense to Iron Mountain, and we had more financial discipline to that. That's also what led us to conclude that getting out of the Digital business, which, I believe, in the long run, still would have been a great thing to be in, but getting out of the business was the right thing to do because we could not get big enough fast enough given the pace at which the move -- the business was starting to move around us, and nor were we willing to pay the prices that others were willing to pay in those markets. We couldn't make it make sense in our business.  But having said that, look, we are being transparent about how we think about capital allocation, and there'll be more to come on that. But in April, what we announced was basically a plan to distribute $2.2 billion over 3 years, the term of our 3-year plan, back to our shareholders. And one of my first mistakes in that plan is I committed an absolute date for the first $1.2 billion, the mistake being not giving you the money. I just wish I hadn't put exactly a hard date on it because as soon as I said it and it came out of my mouth, I realized I was constrained about at what price I had to do certain things, and that took away some of my flexibility, which I don't like to happen to me. But nevertheless, we did it anyway. And so through a combination of increased dividends and share buybacks, through year end, we've distributed $1.2 billion, and we will complete that commitment with our next annual -- or our next quarterly dividend payment. Through beginning -- well, through last year, we bought in 38 million shares or about 18% of the total shares outstanding. We did that through a combination of the proceeds of the sale of the Digital business. We took those proceeds and returned it back to shareholders. Increasing leverage from an all-time low, down under 3x, up to about close to 3.5x, about 3.4x currently, close, and in our range of 3x to 4x sort of thing. And we went to the market and raised some more high-yield in order to fund that leverage and, of course, as I've said, out of our free cash flow. So we're on plan to do that. The next $1 billion, we're on plan. We've got 2 more years. We don't have quite as hard a timetable as I've put on the first $1.2 billion, so we might take a little more flexibility of how we give it back to you, but we're on plan, assuming nothing changes out there in the future. The fourth element, which could create that change, okay, is to look at structural alternatives. At this stage of the business, as I said, when you've reached that point at which you have excess capital, and it's always a question of the right way to allocate it, are -- we wanted to look at are there structural alternatives of ways of allocating capital and distributing capital back to our shareholders, including, obviously, our conversion to a REIT is one of them. That would create more efficiently -- more efficient -- that is tax efficiency, by and large, to distribute this capital back to you as our shareholders. So we -- at the Board level, we created a special committee. That special committee has been working hard and diligently. We've, again, put a target date, I think it's June 9, in which we would come back and communicate to the market the results of that special committee work. We will meet that target, and that's all I'm going to have to say on that subject today. So those are the 4 elements of our strategy. As I said, it's focused on refocusing our business back on our core. The core is running well. It's about refocusing, making sure -- not that we ever did not have a focus on return on invested capital, by the way, but sharpening that focus and making sure you understand how we think about that focus on the returns, focusing on capital allocation. Capital allocation is something we've done, but this is the time to think about it in a different way because historically, our capital allocation was we needed more capital to grow the business. That was a pretty easy decision, okay? But now we have choices, and we have to make sure we make those choices appropriately. And then last thing, as I said, make sure, looking forward, given how we see the business continuing to grow and the cash generation capabilities, looking forward to how we distribute that capital to you in the most efficient manner. So that's the summary of our change in business strategy. We've been pretty busy, as you might imagine, and we're going to stay busy for a long time to come. And I think we've made outstanding progress. By the way, and I think the -- I really do want to commend the management team for a couple of things. First, they welcomed me back, which I appreciate a lot, and they've put their heads down and they're working really hard. And second is we not only did all this work, we're delivering good financial performance across the board. So it was a good year. I don't care how you cut it. It was a good year. So a couple last topics. I do want to talk a little bit about return on invested capital because as we do all this work, we make changes, we study things, we think hard, we listen to some of you, and we've made some internal changes I think we want to share with you a little bit. And many of you often ask me when I'm out on the road, so how do we think about returns? How do we incorporate returns into compensation? Well, first is it's always been in my compensation, for those that know me, you realize I'm a rather large shareholder, and as a rather large shareholder, first and foremost, I want a return on my capital. And by the way, I invested money to get that capital. It was not stock option granted, it was my money, checks written, debt taken on and so forth. So I take the issue very seriously, always have, always will. But in addition to that, as a management tool, we have, and we started in 2011 and we've expanded some in 2012, incorporated return on invested capital into our incentive compensation programs for our senior leaders. We only deal with it at the very senior level because the way we operate the business is we control capital centrally. We think about Iron Mountain as a very distributed operating company. You think about a few people at corporate as a banker, and you have to make your case to the banker. You have to make your return case, you have to make your business case before the bank will give you any money. And we want to sweep account on your operations, so we take all your cash away from you every day. So if you want anything back, you have to come ask for it.  So with that method of control and so forth, we control the return decisions at the central level. And some people say, "Well, don't you want all your field managers around the world think about return on invested capital?" No, I don't, and I'll tell you why. I don't want them thinking about it because there's a lot more business out there, and I want them to go get it. And they can't spend money the way we're structured without asking, and we know how to give them the right answers, okay. Second is I know when you run a broad geographic business spread all over the world like ours, if I incentivize somebody on return on invested capital, the easiest way to get return on invested capital is to avoid spending capital and maintaining your business, put off till next year or 5 years out when you don't care if you're in the job, maintain the business, protecting the customer assets, protecting the brand, yadi-yadi-ya. I know it. I know how I could do it. I know how they could do it. And what I want them to do is I want to see a long list of projects. I want them asking for everything. And I'm happy to weed through a long list of projects and say no to a lot rather than having them weed through it and never even showing us the stuff that, frankly, could be damn important to the business. So we think we've got it balanced right. It is, we think, an appropriate level of the company, and it's important. So how do we calculate it? As we started to broaden that, we realized that sort of some traditional methods and some we've used even in our plan didn't work very well because when you try to visualize it and localize it, which we do want to do, we want to know what we're doing in different parts of the world and everything else, it doesn't make any sense. So we've taken an owner's earnings approach. I'm sure you can call Stephen later if you don't get this and write it down, so I won't go too slow. But the numerator is the NOPAT plus depreciation, amortization less nongrowth CapEx, okay. Nongrowth CapEx, we think, is the better indication of costs to sustain the current business than depreciation, which is the product of our prior investments and long-lived assets. And you can see nongrowth CapEx broken out in our 10-K reportings. So all the detail is out. You can do the same math we're doing, in fact. The denominator is average invested capital, and it's adjusted to align with the same methodology and calculation of the numerator. These, we believe, were the cash returns we generated on investments that were made in the business. And to give you a sense of that, in 2011, this -- our -- calculated this way, the ROIC of the company increased from 10.7 in 2010 to 11.4 in 2011. The other thing we do is everything, every investment that comes up to our so-called bank to be funded has to be viewed against a WACC plus a premium, and that premium is in line with the risk inherent with the project. And some investments are no-brainers. They're pure math. And some investments, they've got a lot of risk in them, and you got to have a different risk premium based on where it is. And it goes for geographies, it goes for a variety of other elements. So I think we've got actually quite a robust way of doing that, and I share that with you because enough of you ask me questions when I'm on the road. I'm just making sure I'm giving everybody the same answer so that everybody understands it the way we think about it. So before I -- let me move on to the last subject I got, and before I turn it over to Brian, let me comment on the outlook and our guidance. Hear us clearly. We think the operating performance for this year, 2012, will reflect the same business fundamentals as last year. Growth is expected in line with last year, and you should see some improved margins coming from International. The changes to recycled paper prices and even fluctuations in FX, particularly what's going on in Europe these days, will likely cloud this operating performance on a reported basis. We forecast both paper and FX off of current rates, current market rates and are transparent when we report to you both on the up and down, and they go both ways. But given the deterioration of current market rates most recently and particularly since our preliminary guidance late last year, we're updating our guidance based upon current rates. Any positive change in these rates could provide a positive upgrade. And of course, the negative change will go the other way. In this case, we believe on paper, which is the biggie here, we believe will stabilize, but I'm not guaranteeing that. And we actually do believe it's asymmetrical from a risk perspective. That is there's a better chance of it going up throughout the year than going down from it. If that happens, there will be upside to the outlook in the forecast. And again, we will not attempt to cover if there are operating performance shortfalls even on a reported basis, maybe paper can cover it. We'll make sure you see it, and we'll make sure that it's clear, what's coming from where. So with that said, let me turn over to Brian who will brief you on all the rest of the details, and then Steve will come back and take your questions.
Brian P. McKeon: Thanks, Richard. I'll do a review today of the fourth quarter and full year 2011 performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2012. Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. Our business performed well in Q4. We delivered consistent results that capped up a year of strong financial performance. We had results that were, again, supported by solid storage revenue growth and continued profit improvement in our international business. Reported revenue for Q4 was 2%, with consistent trends compared to recent quarters. Storage revenues increased 4% on a constant currency basis, supported by consistent 3% internal growth. Service revenues were flat to last year on a constant currency basis as strong gains in hybrid services and benefits from higher commodity prices were offset by continued softness in North American core service activity levels. Profit performance was in line with our expectations after adjusting for Italy. The results were, again, supported by strong gains in the International segment. Adjusted OIBDA margins for the International segment increased more than 200 basis points compared to 2010 fourth quarter and the year, and that's keeping us clearly on track to achieve our margin improvement goal of 700 basis points in improvement by the end of 2013. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter of $237 million included an $11 million benefit from the reclassification of our Italian business to discontinued operations. Adjusted EPS was $0.33 in Q4 and $1.31 for the full year. For the full year, we drove 4% revenue growth and continued strong free cash flow. Free cash flow was $458 million in 2011, supported by higher profits, lower interest cost and record capital spending efficiencies. Free cash flow also benefited from low cash tax payments, reflecting prepayments we made in 2010 and benefits from U.S. tax incentives in 2011. We also benefited from a high year-end capital spending accruals related to the timing of projects in the fourth quarter. These factors will normalize in 2012, which I'll speak to in more detail when we review our 2012 outlook. As Richard noted, we achieved key milestones in 2011 as part of our 3-year strategic plan. We continue to expand our International operations while improving returns, resulting in a 25% increase in International adjusted OIBDA. We also paid out $1.1 billion against our initial $1.2 billion shareholder payout commitment and expect to complete this phase of our program with the next quarterly dividend payment in April. We're well positioned to advance our strategic plan, and we'll be providing an update in our 2012 guidance today. Our operating outlook for 2012 hasn't changed from when we spoke to you last October. We continue to plan for 1% to 3% internal revenue growth, excluding the impact of lower paper prices, supported by sustained storage internal growth of 3%. We are revising our guidance to reflect current commodity prices. Since issuing our preliminary 2012 guidance last October, paper prices have declined an additional $50 per ton. Current paper prices are now more than 30% below average levels seen in 2011. At these levels, we project that our revenue and adjusted OIBDA will be about $45 million lower in 2012.  Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin the review of our financial results. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the fourth quarter of 2010. Overall, Q4 was a good quarter, with results as expected after adjusting for Italy. Enterprise revenue growth was 2% on a constant currency basis, supported by 1% internal growth and benefits from acquisitions. Enterprise revenue gains reflect sustained storage revenue internal growth of 3% and global expansion of hybrid services. Records management storage volume increased 2% on a global basis compared to 2010 with consistent pricing trends. Year-on-year gains in recycled paper revenues and higher fuel surcharges also supported overall revenue growth. These gains offset continued pressure in North American core service activities and lower revenues from shredding another services such as fulfillment, film and sound and consulting. From a segment perspective, North America posted [indiscernible] revenue growth, supported by consistent storage internal growth. Service revenues were down 4% in Q4 in North America. Service growth continues to be constrained by reduced retrieval and refile transportation and data protection handling activity. These impacts more than offset strong gains in hybrid revenues and benefits from higher recycled paper revenues and fuel surcharges. Our International segment posted 9% revenue growth on a constant currency basis, supported by 6% internal growth and 3 points of growth from the Polish acquisition completed in early 2011. Storage internal growth remained strong at 6%, supported by solid growth in Europe and sustained double-digit gains in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. These gains were augmented by expansion in hybrid service revenues. Gross profit was $427 million in Q4, yielding a gross margin of 57.5%, down 190 basis points from Q4 of last year. Included in gross profit in Q4 of 2011 is a $12 million reclassification from SG&A expenses to cost of sales to align certain costs primarily related to our scanning operations across the enterprise. Excluding this reclassification, our gross profit in the fourth quarter was in line with prior-year levels. Storage gross margins were consistent year-over-year. Service gross margins, excluding the $12 million reclassification, were down slightly primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and a shift in business mix towards the lower-margin, less capital-intensive hybrid business. Adjusted OIBDA was $237 million or 32% of revenues. Strong performance in our International business more than offset planned increases in North America sales and marketing expense and higher incentive compensation expense compared to low levels in 2010. The reclassification of Italy to discontinued operations was also a positive factor. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $76 million and amortization was $8 million. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.33 per share. Reported earnings per share of $0.26 includes additional impairment charges in the Western European reporting unit, $3 million of other expense and the net impact of discrete tax items. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 38%, slightly lower than expected due to the reclassification of Italy. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 47% and included the impacts of the International impairment charges, foreign currency losses and adjustments to deferred taxes.  Let's now look at -- let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange for Q4 and the full year. Our internal growth finished the year within our expected full year ranges, highlighted by solid storage internal growth of 3%. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter resulted in a decrease in reported revenues of approximately 1% and reduced the positive impact of foreign currency and our full year growth rates.  In terms of our Q4 results, overall reported revenue growth was 2%. Storage internal growth remains solid at 3%, reflecting consistent underlying trends. North America reported 2%. Internal storage growth and International storage internal growth remained strong at 6%. Net global records management volume was 2%, again, on a year-on-year basis in Q4, reflecting continued strong gains in International and modest year-on-year growth in North America. Service internal growth was minus 1%. Core service internal growth was flat in the quarter. We saw benefits from higher fuel surcharges and strong growth in hybrid services. As noted, we did see, however, continued pressure on core service activity, particularly in North America, which will offset these gains. We also saw lower revenues from other core services, such as shredding and recurring projects in Q4. We expect that overall core service growth will remain constrained in the coming quarters. Complementary service revenues, which represent about 12% of total revenues, decreased 5% internally in the quarter. Results reflected reduced benefits from recycled paper revenues due to lower paper prices and lower revenues from other complementary services such as fulfillment, film and sound and consulting. Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our full year results. As noted, 2011 was a year of strong financial performance in which we achieved our financial objectives. For the full year, revenue increased 4% to $3 billion. Gross profit also increased 4% to $1.8 billion or 58.7% of revenues. Excluding the re-class from SG&A I discussed earlier, 2011 gross margins were up modestly over 2010. Adjusted OIBDA grew 2% year-over-year, excluding the $15 million of costs associated with the proxy contest. As expected, adjusted OIBDA growth has been constrained by planned investments in North America sales and marketing in 2011 and the higher levels of incentive compensation compared to low 2010 levels. Adjusted EPS was $1.31 per share, including a $0.05 impact from the $15 million of costs related to the proxy contest. Excluding these impacts, adjusted EPS was up about 6% for the year, reflecting lower interest expense and the benefit of fewer shares outstanding. 2011 capital spending was $198 million, excluding $20 million for real estate. As a percent of revenues, CapEx, excluding real estate, was 6.6%, down 130 basis points from 2010 levels. 2011 was the fifth consecutive year in which we've reduced CapEx as a percentage of revenues. Free cash flow from continuing operations for 2011 was $458 million, up 24% from last year's levels. As noted, solid profit performance, including lower interest expense and improved capital efficiency, were fundamental drivers of the increase. Our cash tax payments were also low at $96 million in 2011. We benefited from prepayments made in 2010, as well as temporary U.S. tax incentives. Finally, we benefited from the timing of some of our Q4 capital expenditures resulting in an unusually high year-end accrual. This accrual will reverse in Q1 and is expected to reduce free cash flow by about $20 million in 2012. Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review our results by segment. Slide 7 shows full year key metrics for each of our 3 segments compared to 2010. Consistent with our 3-year strategic plan, we're sustaining high returns in our North American segment as we build momentum in our International segment as a significant driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. In 2011, our North American business segment posted 2% reported revenue growth and achieved its planned adjusted OIBDA margin goals while absorbing approximately $20 million of the incremental sales and marketing investment to sustain the revenue annuity. Adjusted OIBDA margins were effectively flat at 43% as the return of incentive compensation to more normal levels in 2011 reduced reported margins by approximately 100 basis points.  Our International segment continues to post solid revenue growth and strong adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. Our International business reported strong 7% constant dollar revenue growth in 2011, driven by 9% constant dollar storage revenue gains. Adjusted OIBDA increased 25%, or 19% excluding FX impacts, keeping us on track to achieve our adjusted OIBDA margin expansion goal of 700 basis points by the end of 2013. These gains were driven primarily by realized benefits of operational excellence initiatives in our U.K. business. We're targeting continued strong improvement of 150 to 200 basis points in International margins in 2012, supported by operational improvements in markets outside of the U.K. and profit gains in expansion markets. The increase in corporate expenses primarily reflects $15 million of onetime costs associated with the proxy contest. Overall, we continue to deliver strong operating performance across our business, which is driving sustained strong cash flow. This performance is supporting large shareholder payouts. Let's now turn to Slide 8 to review our stockholder payout program. Slide 8 shows the substantial progress we've made in returning funds to stockholders over the past 2 years. Since first announcing our plans to return cash to shareholders in February of 2010, we returned nearly $1.4 billion to stockholders comprised of $250 million of dividend payments and the repurchase of 38 million shares for more than $1.1 billion. As Richard noted, the 38 million shares represents more than 18% of the shares we had outstanding at the end of 2009. As part of our 3-year strategic plan presented in April 2011, we committed to $2.2 billion of payouts through 2013, including $1.2 billion by May 2012. As part of this commitment, we increased our quarterly dividend again to $0.25 per share last June. As of year end, we returned more than $1.1 billion of our initial $1.2 billion commitment, and we expect to complete this phase of our program with our next quarterly dividend payout in April of this year. In Q4, we acquired 14.7 million shares for $440 million. Between January 1 and February 17, we required (sic) [acquired] an additional 1.1 million shares for $35 million. As of February 17, we had $66 million remaining on our existing $1.2 billion share repurchase authorization. Our strong cash flow and financing capacity have us well positioned to deliver our payout commitments.  Let's now turn to Slide 5 to review how we're managing our balance sheet to fund our business and support our payout strategy. Substantial gains and cash flow generation have enabled us to maintain a strong balance sheet. As planned, we increased our leverage by approximately ½ a turn in support of our stockholder payout program. In September of 2011, we issued $400 million of 7 3/4% senior subordinated notes due in 2019. Currently, our consolidated leverage ratio is 3.4x, near the midpoint of our target 3x to 4x leverage range for our company. Our debt portfolio at December 31, 2011, remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate was 6.9%, and we were 83% fixed at year end. Maturity is more than 6 years, with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. We're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At year end, liquidity was more than $800 million, with $180 million in cash and $623 million in additional borrowing capacity. That concludes our review of the Q4 and full year 2011 results. Overall, our business continues to perform well, our financial performance was solid as expected, and we're well positioned for 2012.  Let's now turn to Slide 10 to begin a review of our 2012 outlook. Slide 10 highlights the key factors supporting our current outlook for 2012 financial performance. As context, we reviewed our preliminary guidance for 2012 in October. At the time, we noted that paper pricing was quite dynamic and that we'd updated our outlook on the year-end call to reflect any changes. Today, we are updating our preliminary 2012 outlook to reflect current paper pricing levels. Paper prices continued to fall through the end of 2011, and at the current market levels, paper pricing is now 32% below average levels seen last year. At these levels, this will reduce 2012 revenue and OIBDA growth by $45 million or 2% and 5%, respectively. Paper pricing can fluctuate, and we've seen some improvement in market pricing early this year. We've incorporated current lower pricing levels into our full year outlook. If paper prices continue to improve, we would expect positive flow-through to our projected 2012 revenue and profits. Excluding paper price impacts, our guidance is consistent with our preliminary outlook, reflecting expectations for consistent revenue growth trends in our business. We're targeting 1% to 3% internal revenue growth x paper in 2012. We've included a schedule that breaks down our growth projections by revenue type in the appendix for this presentation. We expect to sustain storage growth of above 3%, supported by strong International gains of 5% to 6% and continued moderate growth in North America. Overall, service internal growth is expected to be relatively flat. We're planning for continued soft trends in North America core service activity, which will offset strong target growth in hybrid services. We're also targeting solid underlying gains in adjusted OIBDA, supported by continued International margin improvement and sustained high returns in North America. Let's turn to Slide 11 to summarize our 2012 outlook. Excluding the impact of paper prices, we're expecting revenue growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted OIBDA growth of 1% to 5% on a constant currency basis. Our outlook for 2012 does not include the impact of any potential future acquisitions. Acquisitions added about 1% to our growth in 2011. On a reported basis, this outlook supports revenue guidance of between $2,965,000,000 and $3,045,000,000 and adjusted OIBDA of $890 million to $930 million. Included in our adjusted OIBDA outlook is about $3 million of estimated costs we expect to incur in the first half of this year related to the special committee finishing their work. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.36. Our calculation of adjusted EPS assumes a structural tax rate of 39% and 172 million shares outstanding. We're planning for relatively flat capital spending of $215 million, including about $25 million for spending for real estate. At midpoint revenue estimates, this will result in a further reduction of capital spending as a percentage of sales, consistent with our strategic planned goals.  Our outlook is for solid free cash flow performance in the range of $320 million to $360 million. This outlook includes an estimated $20 million negative impact from the flow-over of high year-end capital accruals in 2011, as well as the estimated $45 million impact from current low recycled paper price levels. Normalizing for these factors, annual free cash flow would be in the $400 million range. Our cash forecast incorporates about $30 million of higher interest cost related to our increase in leverage to support the $1.1 billion of shareholder payouts in 2011, as well as expectations for higher cash tax payments compared to low 2011 levels. Based on our outlook for 2012, we expect our return on invested capital to be in the range of 11%.  In summary, 2011 was a year of solid financial performance. We achieved several key milestones in our 3-year strategic plan. Our business is performing well, and we're well positioned for 2012. Thank you. We'd now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wanted to ask about the 2012 OIBDA growth. I understand from your comments that you're expecting 1% to 5% constant currency growth without the effect of paper. Looking back to October, I believe you were looking for 1% to 5% constant currency growth on OIBDA for 2012, with the paper effect. Could you help bridge that for us?
Brian P. McKeon: Just normal end-of-year refinements, Andrew. I don't see that as a material change. We're just firming up the plan. And basically, on a year-over-year basis, we're seeing the benefits from the International margin improvement and some of the onetime lapping benefits being offset by the paper declines. So it's relatively consistent with where we were.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes. Maybe, Brian, if you could say it in a different way, we're now expecting paper prices to be a 5% drag to OIBDA. Back in October -- at the paper prices, back in October, what would have the drag been for 2012?
Brian P. McKeon: It would've been about half that.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: I wondered if you could give us a sense, Brian, if I have it right, it looks like the EBITDA impact from paper is about $45 million, but the overall EBIT is only coming down $25 million. I wonder where the offset is there, number one. And then number two, the free cash flow looks like it's declining $40 million versus overall EBITDA of $25 million. Can you just help us reconcile that?
Brian P. McKeon: Yes. On the paper question, we had some of the impact baked into the preliminary guidance, so it's basically the same question Andrew just asked. We had about half of it baked in when we talked to you in October, and it came down another $50 a ton. On free cash flow, I know there's a lot of movement there. One way to think about this is if you look at 2011, we had $458 million. Normalizing that, we're really about $400 million. We had a $20 million of benefit in 2011 from year-end capital accruals, basically the timing in Q4 where the cash didn't go out the door until just after year end. And we also had some benefits from higher cash tax prepayments we made in 2010, which benefited this year. If you reduce the $450 million, you're closer to the $400 million range. When you move forward in 2012, our midpoint is $340 million. That's dampened by that $20 million capital carryover, which is more onetime, and it's also dampened by the paper impact of $45 million. So when you normalize for that, it gets up more into the $400 million range. The one thing we did try to highlight is in 2012, keep in mind, we are going to have some impacts from the higher interest levels. We borrowed money to fund the shareholder payouts, and that's about a $30 million year-on-year pretax impact, so that pulled the number down a bit.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: That's super helpful. Can you just give us the actual assumptions that foresaw the office paper pricing used in 2012 and what the average was in 2011?
Brian P. McKeon: Yes. The market pricing average in 2011 was in the $230 million range, and we're using the current paper price, which is $155 a ton. It was a little below that starting the year. It was $138. So we have a month there of -- our actual realized pricing tends to lag a bit. We contract off of indexes with suppliers that we're not dealing with the spot market, and we didn't really see the negative impact of the decline at the very end of the year, and we're starting to see that flow through in the early part of the year. So when you use that kind of drop of $75 a ton plus some of the carryover impact, that's how we get to the $45 million estimate.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Super helpful. And then if I could, just a third quick one. In terms of the REIT, I know we'll get a decision by June 9. I just want to get a sense of what the main factors are going to drive, whether we pursue that or not, number one. And then number two, how does that impact the leverage of the company overall on a go-forward basis as you think about it, if you were to pursue it and you're thinking about the capital structure as a result of that?
C. Richard Reese: Kevin, I'll try to take that. Look, I think your question is how would we think about -- I think your question is how do we think about the REIT, is that correct?
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Yes.
C. Richard Reese: All right. Look, we could spend all day on that. I'll just say a few things about it. We are at a point where we're getting close to the June 9, and I want to make sure people are not reading anything I say either way because the first thing I'm going to tell you, it's about the most complicated Rubik's cube I've ever seen, and it is one of the most intellectually interesting problems I've ever seen, by the way, too. Having said that, we're working very hard at it and -- with a positive hypothesis to see if it can be made to work or not, but you also have to understand the REIT itself is only valuable if it can be done in a way that doesn't -- as I've used sort of in a colloquial fashion, the phrase is "Don't kill the goose that lays a golden egg." This is a goose with a long duration, and the value of our company is maintaining the duration. And to maintain the duration, you have to have a certain level of flexibility of how you operate and some ability to reinvest the capital to grow the business and so forth. So it's a trade of going for tax savings against balancing that, and it is overlaid with a lot of technical complexities, IRS complexities, operational and so forth and so on. So it's not like you'd go from a to b, make a decision, walk away. It's just not that easy. I wish it were because we'd be done by now. And to be frank with you, it's consumed a lot of our time and energy and a lot of focus of a lot of senior people in the business. In terms of what the REIT would do to leverage, there's all kinds of scenarios because the next question you have to ask yourself would be if your operator is a REIT, what does it do to your strategy? Do you change your strategy? How does that change? And so forth. So it's, again, too early to make a comment on that. We would expect that before June 9 -- or maybe I'd even say before our own June 9 because I don't exactly know when we will actually get it finished. Or said another way, when we do come forth with a decision, we will try to predict an answer as many as the questions that you guys have now. Either if we say we're going to pursue being a REIT, we'll try to be very clear and precise, and if we say we're not, we'll try to do the same thing, so...
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: That's helpful. And then in terms of -- at the June 9, is it -- how long after, if you try to pursue, would you ultimately get a decision from the IRS? Is it one year or kind of 2 to 4 quarter?
C. Richard Reese: It could take up to a year.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess, Richard, how should we think about the lower activity levels? And is this something that is cyclically driven at this point, or do you see more secular pressure on that than you've seen in the past? And is there any prospects for that getting better, or should we just think about these much lower activity levels being the norm as we go through the next couple of years?
C. Richard Reese: All right. I think, by and large -- and this little bit varies by geography. I mean, if you go to certain parts of the world, we're having very high activity levels, okay? So I think some of you expect it. Clearly, in the health care space, which is a key component that's driving it, as I've said, that is a modality shift and a real shift that's pretty unusual, but -- yes, and that will take some years for that to roll through. In the data protection tape rotation side, again, as customers install more technology to mirror themselves, they continue to use tape as a failsafe against their infrastructure and so forth, as well as archival, but it's less activity, less active kind of pattern and so forth. So I think we're going through some, over quite a bit of time, headwind for quite a few years as some of this does reside itself. And I do think our servicing relationship to storage is going to reside itself. You notice the storage is chugging along really quite well. Customers continue to generate information, and they continue to need to keep it and maintain it regardless of how they access it. So -- but yes, we are planning and assuming we're going to see those service headwinds for quite some time.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then I was intrigued by the quick commentary on the last 20 years, the move of legacy records offsite in North America, the next 15 or 20 you said, same thing happening in some of these more growthy markets. Is there any evidence, or are you at all fearful that how this trend happens in some of the growth your emerging markets will be different, meaning that they'll maybe use more technology and less physical documents given that that technology is available today as those economies and industry in those economies grows? Or do you think the roadmap is going to look pretty darn similar to what you've seen in the last 20 years...
C. Richard Reese: I think it's going to look pretty darn similar for a couple of reasons. One is a lot of the records that you generate and you bring up our legacy, they've already been created, okay? They've just got to get assembled and moved and organized and so forth and so on. Places like Latin America is growing like a weed both on storage and activity and payments, and they're very technology savvy. We do more technology services in Latin America, more complex things for our customers than we do anywhere else, too. So there's a higher adoption rate of everything. And I think, look, what really happens is when you got great growing economies, you get it all happening, okay? And so it's pretty simplistic stuff to think about. Go where the world is going to be growing, and there's going to be a lot of information created, thrown out, need to be managed, need to be secured. And just like in North America, the real trend that you got to keep in mind is information was junk 25 or 30 years ago that people kept, just like you probably have an attic full or basement full, at least I do, of stuff that you keep because you won't throw it away, information. When I joined the business, that's the way it was looked at by everybody except pretty much financial services, okay? People didn't know why they kept it. They just kept it. And it has shifted to being a scenario where information is an asset. That means the way you think about its security, its chain of custody, its processing, who sees it, yadi-yadi-yada, go up. It has to be managed. It has to be maintained. That's going to happen in the rest of the world. That trend, I know, is absolutely happening already. And yes, there'll be plenty more technology moving around. The net of that -- the issue of plenty more technology moving around is some of our hybrid businesses in some of these emerging markets are booming faster than they are in our mature markets. And as I said, we do more complex work with more part of the chain of process of the business than everything else. So in a lot of respects, it makes it stickier, too.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just one follow-up. Brian, I think you made a comment that average OIBDA had an $11 million benefit for moving Italy to discontinued. Can you just run through the math of that or maybe correct me if I heard that wrong?
Brian P. McKeon: No, you didn't. It was -- in 2011, there was a few pieces. We have small operating losses in Italy. We had restructuring charges that were related to the overall International improvement plan, and we also had some costs related to the fire that we disclosed and talked about. So the combination of those 3 in terms of the profit results in 2011, moving them to discontinued operations was about $11 million of losses. That's not the run rate of the business. I think going forward, we're targeting basically flattish kind of profit in 2012, so there wasn't a benefit going forward. But there was a fair bit of losses that we're incurring this year.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That's for the full year. What was the number for the fourth quarter?
Brian P. McKeon: I don't have that right in front of me, but a fair amount of those costs were in the fourth quarter. We can follow up on that for you.
C. Richard Reese: Operator, we're going to take one more call. I have historically tried to promise to keep this to one hour, and I'm already 5 minutes over. And it's my fault because I talked 30 minutes of it. So I apologize now. Plus we look at the queue of who's calling, and we're going to be on the phone with everyone of you throughout the rest of the day, so we'll make sure we catch your calls. But we'll take one more call for the group. Thank you.
Operator: Your final question will come from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: The -- I wanted to dig a little bit more into the previous question and just look at the service trends. I guess outside of health care, we're already seeing some of the structural changes in that industry. What are maybe the next couple of industries that make up a bigger portion of the service revenue? And are you seeing secular challenges there as well?
C. Richard Reese: Financial services is a big player. I think financial services, to be candid with you, it's a different trend. Financial services, early adopter technology. They adopted technology years and years ago of all types, and -- but they're also major creators of information, including paper. The big trend in financial services is they, over the last 5, at least 5 to 7 years, have really gone about organizing their physical programs, making sure they know what they have and getting rid of what they can get rid of. And as you know, they've gone through various cycles of litigation cycles, some of which they're still in. And when they get in these litigation cycles, they basically continue to accumulate documents but don't throw much away. And then if they get a little breathing point between lawsuits and so forth and if the program is organized correctly, and they have to be in most cases, they'll do sort of catch-up destructions. And so financial services, what you've seen over the last few years is a dampening of growth on the storage side related to that trend. It'll build up, and then they'll do a lot of "Let's get rid of it," big destruction process. You also, by the way, see that after we talk about they rightsize their program, they get themselves caught up, then they grow along very nicely off of a lower base and so forth. And so when you deal with as much of them as we do, every year, you get big activities like that. So that's the big trend in financial services. They have been relatively inactive for a long time because they, as I've said, are the extreme early adopters of technology on this front. The health care is just -- in a lot of respects, it's just very unique. You know maybe more than I do about health care, but you know that a lot of money -- the Obama health care plan, the headline was $44 billion. I've been told it's going to be $80 billion, give or take. They're going to try to get every health organization to be computerized as carrots and sticks. It's going be interesting to watch it happen, but that's a lot of money to spend, and that's not even -- that's not being spent to reduce the storage or an activity bill. I wish we did have a percentage of that in the business. But we will see the fallout as they totally change their workflow. Not to 0, but it's going to rightsize. There's no doubt in my mind. And by the way, we are in a case where the comedown will be faster than the rise up. There's good opportunity for us in health care, and the best thing, to give you example, is the record type in health care that's dropped the fastest and continues and will drop the fastest, as I said, is physical x-rays. Because that is a case of real technology switch-out where they don't make them anymore, by and large. They do it on CAT scans, MRIs and other things. And that's why we, a few years ago, started a Digital business, digital record center for medical images. And when we sold our Digital business, we did not sell that product line. We announced a partnership not too long ago with NetApp, where we are their cloud back-end in that space. Like all annuity businesses that you do from scratch, it will start very slowly, but if you roll out over quite a bit of time, and that's the patience level that I understand that many of you don't have, but I've seen this movie many times, that will be a very nice business. And that's just going -- it'll be bigger than the x-ray business we have today. It will be more profitable than the x-ray business we have today, okay? But we're going to go through the troughs. When one comes down and the another one rises, the comedown rate is a lot faster than the rise rate. And it's just -- that's a fact of life.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just to put some context around this, so I think, Richard, in the past, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you said that health care represents, I don't know, something like 10% of your total revenues, but it's disproportionately service-based to your prior comments.
C. Richard Reese: Well, the total health care is bigger, a bit bigger, but the highly active piece is smaller. Yes, it's like in the 5 or less of the storage kind of business.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: As a percentage of service, though, what percentage does health care represents in 2011?
Brian P. McKeon: All services for records management, it's probably more in the 20% range, a higher percentage because of the more active nature of some of it. And as part of the overall business, it's somewhat smaller because we don't have the same kind of development, in areas like data protection or also outside of the U.S. So that's a U.S. kind of reference.
C. Richard Reese: Yes. And the other thing I would stress to you, look, anything can change, but we dug pretty deep and looked at individual customer behavior. And what we do tend to see is an adoption curve where a customer will adopt, and their pattern will rapidly decline, and then it'll settle to a new level and then it goes on, all right? And then of course, what happens is every month or whatever, new customers are hitting that adoption cycle. And yes, we probably could do a better job. We just haven't slowed down and think about it, try to precisely guess how many years out this will run. But it will run quite a few years. It's a little bit every year. I mean, there's a low probability this will just -- we'll wake up one day and it'll drop like a rock. I think it'll just keep doing this for a while, unfortunately -- unfortunately, whichever way you look at it. I'm happy to keep it for a long time. We make money at it. On the other hand, we'll be whining about it for some years.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: That's helpful. And if you could, I just want to get a little bit better sense of the International growth rates, clearly, a big driver of the business here. And Richard, you kind of talked about the denominator effect in North America. I'm trying to understand a little bit better the denominator effect of your International markets. Clearly, there's some very mature and some very growthy markets today. If you could separate how much of your International business would be kind of in that mature or slower growth rate versus the faster growth markets, just so we can get a sense of kind of where you are on this long trend line.
C. Richard Reese: Yes. We're scrambling for a document which will tell us that. You actually can find that on our website. If you looked at our April strategy presentation, we broke all that out, and somebody's going to point to me. All right, Stephen, interpret these numbers for me quickly.
Stephen P. Golden: About half.
C. Richard Reese: It's about half in what we call material leadership markets, which have a little better growth rate than North America, and about half in emerging markets, okay?
Brian P. McKeon: It's a little bit higher if you throw in...
C. Richard Reese: No, excuse me. Yes, leadership.
Brian P. McKeon: These numbers throw in -- take basically U.K. and Western Europe, it's probably 60% or more, which looks a lot like the U.S. in terms of the growth profile.
C. Richard Reese: So as I said, we've run over, which we try not to do, but it's my long-windedness, which I apologize for. It was a good year of financial performance, as I said, and a good year of change. And I think the organization has adapted to the change very well, which we appreciate a lot. We've got a lot of work ahead of us. We are -- this is REIT, no REIT capital allocation work that's ongoing, I'll be candid with you now. We've set a date. It's such a complex Rubik's cube. It is a difficult issue. As you turn over rocks, you find more worms. You turn over more rocks, you find more worms. But we're working it really hard. We're going to make the deadline one way or the other, but we are focused hard on it. And we appreciate your support, and we look forward to seeing you guys as we're out on the road, and many of you, we'll talk to the rest of the day. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Bonnie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q3 2011 Earnings Call Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Golden, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen P. Golden: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our 2011 third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are: Richard Reese, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian McKeon, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will open the phone for your Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for our 2011 and 2012 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed SEC reports for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. With that I'd like to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Richard Reese.
C. Richard Reese: Thank you, Stephen. Good morning and I thank everyone for joining this morning. I'm going to see if I can move fairly quickly because we've got quite a bit of information to try to cover for you today. In addition to our normal Q3 review, we will talk a little bit about the outlook for next year, as well as I'm going to review our -- some of our elements to our strategic plan and just give you a sense of our progress on some of the major parts of that. And then last, I'll give you a bit of an overview of our outlook for 2012 and of course, Brian will give you much more detail on all of this. As we talk today, we will be mentioning, multiple times, the impact of foreign exchange and rates, so forth on our reported numbers, our outlooks and our discussion are based upon recent trading ranges and I should tell you that actual mileage may vary, given what seems to be going on with the markets. But we have just used the last couple of weeks as a basis for our forecasting. So let's get to Q3. Performance for the quarter was good and really on target as we've expected. Our reported revenue is up 6%, with about 3% really excluding any impacts of FX. Storage rates were solid at 4% on a constant currency basis, and the trends remain consistent. Total services were up 5% on a reported basis but, we continued to also to see weakness in our core service, and those trends remained unchanged and that weakness primarily in North America. Adjusted OIBDA was $250 million, was on target, in line of our plans. Overall, it was a solid quarter, consistent trends and performance as we expected and as we forecasted. We're still not seeing any positive signs from the so-called economic rebound, and I should warn that, that based upon our numbers and that we saw when the economies came down as we lag going down, we would likely lag on any rebound. So the trends in the business remained the same, solid storage, weaker than average services and the organization is performing well and the numbers are flowing through. On a full outlook basis, it's the same message from an operating outlook with the fundamentals in the business remains the same. We're reiterating our internal revenue growth guidance in the 1% to 3% range, and it will be supported by various contingent solid storage growth. As I said before, the business units are performing to plan, and we expect them to continue doing that through the balance of the year. The international margin expansion plan is on track, and I'll speak more about international a little later. So the business is running. I won't say it's ho-hum. People are working pretty hard to make these performers come in. It's a tough economy out there, but the fundamentals of business are sound, the storage keeps coming in, and we continue to react to our customers' needs. Full year results will be impacted by some of the macro factors and decisions we've made, based upon the completion of our international portfolio review, which I'm going to discuss in more detail. And recent changes in the dollar will give us a little less benefit for the balance of the year in FX. We're also taking a $10 million restructuring charges in Q4 in Western Europe to support these margin expansion programs, which I'll give you more detail on. So wrapping up 2011, from an operating outlook perspective, we've got good internal growth given the economic environment we're operating in. I'd remind you, this is a business that the internal growth rates tend to run historically taking 1x to 2x GDP, and where business is running north of 1x to 2x GDP now in an internal growth rate basis, particularly related to our Storage, which is the driver of our business. So the business units are performing well. We wish the economy were better. We wish we had a little more stability in foreign exchange just to take the noise out of the numbers, but those are not either things that we can control. So we're operating the business based upon the things we can control. So let me talk now a little bit about our strategic plan initiatives we announced back in April. The objective of that plan was to have a really strong, high margin, high return, North American business continue to grow as well as continue to stay -- stay in the margins. They're working hard at that and doing a good job. Their performance is on target with consistent Storage revenue growth of around 2% on a year-to-date basis. They still have the headwinds in core service revenues that we've spoken of now for quite a few quarters. It's caused largely by economic activity, although there are some elements going on in a few sectors such as healthcare, but the big change is in economic activity. To give you some context, about 31% of our total enterprise revenues, or about $950 million are core services and it's a wide range of things, all of which are one way or the other related to items that we store for customers and by and large, are types of services that we cannot stimulate the demand for. In other words, if we store an item and you want to retrieve it, you pay us to retrieve it, deliver it, destroy it and so forth, and so it's tied to our recurring revenue based in a key part of the current revenue base but tied to stuff that we store for you. And we saw impact of the economy on these revenues early on, back as early as 2009. We started seeing them come off, if you will, look at the numbers on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it's amazing how they were running very steadily in the high single digits and just started they just started coming down and have been coming down. The rate of decline has slowed, but the trends are basically the same. What that's led to is that historically, these revenues used to lead storage growth by 3 to 4 points, and now they're lagging storage growth. In our forecast, we're still not forecasting any rebound and if there were an economic rebound since we will likely lag it, we are not forecasting any change in that trend to the balance of this year or into next year. On the other side, our Hybrid business is continuing to grow well in double digits. And some of our other services, things are doing well. And the growth story around the world varies a lot. We've got much stronger growth in the international basis than we do in the North American basis, partly because of different business mix and partly because of a higher mix of emerging markets and so forth. So but anyway, the North America outlook and in our plan is for consistent margin performance over the long-term. I would warn you, we'll see a little variability around small numbers from quarter-to-quarter and so forth. It's not like we're trying to manage it for a precise exact number. We're managing the business to sustain the margins and sometimes we'll invest a little bit towards that end on one quarter, and sometimes will see results in others and so forth. But we feel very comfortable to be able to do that. The North American numbers also, and are right now feeling impact fluctuations on recycled paper pricing. Recycled paper pricing is off from its all-time high in recent numbers by about $80 a ton. And that does have a significant impact and to the extent that, that continues into 2012, which we are forecasting it will for a while, that will have impact on reported internal growth. There's well as some margin pressures on North America, in which they worked pretty hard to work through. On an international basis, remind you this is a good business. This has got good growth. The reported growth for the quarter was 13% to 14% reported. That's a driven by internal growth in the 5% to 6% range and of course, the balance being FX and acquisitions. We are on target for the 700 basis point margin improvement that we committed to as part of our plan. We've realized 150 basis points through Q3, and expect it to be 200 basis points by the end of the year of this year. And part of that plan, as I said before, taking a $10 million restructuring cost primarily related to personnel costs and headcount related costs primarily in Europe. We have, one of the things we committed to in our strategic plan was a complete review of international portfolio. I want to tell you that we have completed that review, and as to remind you, the majority of that portfolio, which is about 2/3 of the capital investment that we have put in an international basis, is performing well. We have major market positions and we are generating good returns. And by the way, not only do we have good returns, we have plans and that's part of driving the 700 basis points improvement, plans in place to have even better returns on those businesses and those plans are working. As we've gone through the extensive review, the focus really turned into, what we call our mature non-leadership markets, and it was basically focused on 8 countries. That represented about 28% of the capital invested, and we've gone through those 8 countries one by one. You've seen that we've announced that we sold one that are -- we sold our business and exited the market in New Zealand. We sold it and that transaction has closed for $10 million. We have one other country market under review for potential action. It's too early for me to name the country because I don't want to set off any alarms among employees and everything else, but we will either sell, operate a different way or exit at least one other market. Other than that, the remaining 6, we have aggressive improvement plans in place for these countries who we believe will drive the margins up to good numbers and the team is out trying to execute those plans now. As part of that portfolio review, we made some changes in our management structure and business alignments and that realignment led to an accelerated repair -- accelerated impairment review. And primarily in Western Europe, is where the impact of this is. And so in Q3, we've booked a preliminary impairment of a little less than 5% of our total international investment, or about $59 million in the quarter. We have solidified certain of the restructuring plans now and now that we've gone through all this, and as I said before, we are on target for about 200 to 500 basis points of margin improvement through the balance of this year, and we feel in very good position to make the balance of that happen as we go forward. Let me talk to you a little bit about our special committee processes. As many of you know, we constitute a special committee of the board to look at some strategic alternatives in the business and particularly related to whether we -- was more advantageous for operate into a structure as a REIT. I can tell you that the work is in full swing. There's enormous amount of work going on and some money, reasonable, serious amount of money we have spent inside and outside, and time and effort. It will go to next year before final decisions are announced. As you remember, our commitment was to make a decision within one year and announce that decision as to what we plan to do and so forth, and we will meet that target. But I want to set an expectation that it will take some time. Precisely how long? Right now, I don't know and if I did, I probably wouldn't tell you anyway. I will provide updates on the progress, if it's appropriate but otherwise, I really don't want to speculate on an interim basis. I realize also that everybody has lots of questions and wants to ask about what is this, what is that. But we're in the middle of full swing of it and it's just too early to even try to speculate. The last element of our plan was about shareholder payouts. Our commitment was to $2.2 billion dollars over a 3-year time period, with $1.2 billion of that coming within the first year. We've made substantial progress. And as of October 21, we've distributed $726 million against the $1.2 billion commitment. So we're well on target to make that plan work. Since we started buying stock back, we bought in about 25 million shares, or approximately 12% of our total shares outstanding. The balance of the distribution has come to our regular routine quarterly dividends. You'll also notice that we went to the high-yield market a few weeks ago and raised $400 million, had a successful bond offering, 7.75% fixed rate. We completed a deal in September. That gives us more than enough liquidity to continue through these commitment through the early part of our program. So we're in very good shape to deliver on that commitment. From a strategic perspective, the business is operating as we outlined. The free cash flow is coming through, our capital efficiency is doing well and we are doing what we said we'd do with the money while we're at the same time, are looking at are there other better alternatives for the business. So we've got our hands full, we're working hard, but I feel good about how we're progressing there. Quickly or briefly and quickly, let me shift and just give you a quick overview of 2012 and Brian, of course, will give you the details. The operating outlook we seek for 2012 and particularly free cash flow performance is solid. The trends we're forecasting are basic and the same trends we're seeing right now in the business for underlying growth for trends on core services. We're really not forecasting any shifts in trends except for and who knows whether -- and since we don't try to forecast FX, we basically just have to use current numbers, and as I've said we used recent trends for the numbers we're talking about today, who knows whether -- if numbers will be come out of the way with actual FX, given what we think is the volatility we'll likely to see in the markets. But FX will have an impact on the reported side of these numbers and also the decline and the change in paper pricing that I spoke about earlier, if that remains through the year, we'll have an impact on our internal growth. It has about a 1% change in internal growth and as well as our reported numbers. So we do expect to see a lower impact from paper, but the things within our control, weren't really pretty good shape, and are -- we're forecasting the same kind of trends so that would be sustaining returns and operations in North America, and a continuation of international margin expansion with another 150 to 200 basis points. North America margin sustaining will be difficult because of the impact of the Hybrid business growing -- is still growing in double digits, which has a lower margin profile than the average base of the business, and of course, the lower paper pricing is a direct hit in the margins. But regardless of that, we think on an operating basis, the business will perform next year approximately the same as it does this year. We are also expect to have strong free cash flow for next year, all for the good operations of the business and as I said before, we'll continue to meet our shareholder payout commitments, and we will be working very hard on continuing the process for the special committee. So overall in 2012, we think we'll have good operating performance. As I said, there will be constraints to the macro factors. Our key metrics will get continuously better, and we are on track to meet our cash flow commitments. So with all that, let me turn it to Brian. Then we'll come back and take your questions. Thank you.
Brian P. McKeon: Thanks, Richard. Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. Our business delivered solid operating performance in Q3 keeping us on track for our full-year goals. Results were supported by solid storage revenue growth and continued profit improvement in our international business. Revenue growth for the quarter was 6%, with trends consistent with those discussed the last few quarters. Storage revenues increased 6%, or 4% on a constant currency basis. And service revenues grew 5% in the quarter or 2% on a constant currency basis, as strong gains in Hybrid services and benefits from higher commodity pricing offset soft core service activity levels. Profit and cash flow performance was in line with our expectations, supported by strong gains in our international segment. Adjusted OIBDA for the quarter was $252 million as expected. Adjusted EPS was $0.37 for the quarter and free cash flow was $305 million on a year-to-date basis. We've made significant progress against our initial $1.2 billion shareholder payout commitment, highlighted by $537 million of share repurchases and $51 million of cash dividends paid in the quarter. Our successful $400 million debt offering in September has us well-positioned from a liquidity perspective to fund our operations and continue payouts to shareholders. While our operating outlook has not changed, we are revising our full year 2011 guidance to reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and about $10 million of projected restructuring cost in Western Europe. Recent movements in foreign currency exchange rates have narrowed the expected full year FX growth benefit this year by about 1%. In Q4 we also expect to incur about $10 million in restructuring costs in our Western European businesses in support of future margin expansion goals. These costs were not factored into our previous full-year guidance, as more specific plans related to our international portfolio review were still being developed. Looking ahead to 2012, we're targeting continued solid storage growth and strong free cash flow performance. We're planning for consistent revenue growth trends, adjusted for recent changes in foreign exchange rates and a sharp decline in recycled paper prices over the last 2 months. Free cash flow performance is expected to remain strong, as increased operating profits and flat capital spending offset increased interest expense due to higher leverage. Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin the review of our financial results. Slide 4 compares our results from this quarter to the third quarter of 2010. Overall, Q3 was a solid quarter with performance as expected, keeping us on track towards achieving our full-year financial goals. Enterprise revenue growth was 6% supported by constant currency growth of 3% and benefits from favorable FX changes. Enterprise revenue gains reflected sustained storage revenue internal growth of 3%, and global expansion of Hybrid services. Year-end recycled paper prices and higher fuel surcharges also supported overall revenue growth. These gains offset continued softness in core service activities. From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 3% constant currency revenue growth, supported by consistent 2% storage internal revenue growth. Service revenues were up 3% in Q3 in North America. Service growth continues to be constrained by softness in retrieval and refile, transportation and data protection handling activity. These impacts offset strong gains in Hybrid revenues and benefits from higher commodity prices. Our International Physical segment posted 5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis, including 3 points of growth from the Polish acquisition completed earlier this year. Storage internal growth remains strong at 6%, supported by solid gains in Europe and sustained double-digit gains in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. These gains were augmented by expansion in Hybrid service revenues. Total service revenue growth was constrained by lower complementary service revenues due primarily to the winding down of a large European contract. Gross profits grew 7% in Q3, yielding a gross margin of 59.9%, up 90 basis points from Q3 of last year. Storage gross margins were flat compared to last year, while service gross margins benefited from higher recycled paper revenues. Adjusted OIBDA was $252 million, in line with our expectations. Gross profit gains were offset by a 17% increase in overhead expenses. This increase was due primarily to higher incentive compensation accruals, compared to very low prior year levels, and planned increases in North American sales and marketing expenses. Excluding these items, SG&A costs were up 4% below the rate of reported revenue growth. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $71 million and amortization was $7 million. Other expense for the quarter was $17 million, due primarily to FX losses. Due to changes in our internal reporting structure within our international segment, we accelerated our annual goodwill impairment review in the third quarter. As a result of that review, we've recorded an estimated impairment charge of $59 million. This impairment related specifically to our Western European reporting unit, and represented less than 5% of the approximately $1.4 billion of capital we have invested in our international business. We'll finalize the amount in the fourth quarter, and record any adjustment, if necessary at that time. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.37 per share. Reported EPS per share of $0.17 includes impairment charges in the Western European reporting unit and increased Other Expense net, which was partially offset by the net benefit of other discrete tax items. Our structural tax rate for the quarter was 39% as expected. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 33%, and included benefits related to the completion of tax audits, the resolution of certain tax matters and expiration of statutes of limitation, partially offset by the impacts of the international charges in foreign currency losses. Let's now take a look -- a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange for Q3 and the year to date. Also presented is our original full-year guidance we stated earlier this year to exclude discontinued operations. As you can see, all of our year-to-date amounts are within our expected full-year ranges, with year-to-date core and overall internal revenue growth at 2%. The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar will likely constraint our full year reported revenue to the low end of our 4% to 6% guidance range. As I'll discuss in more detail, recent FX rate movements will narrow the full-year growth benefit by about 1% from our earlier 2% estimate. In terms of our Q3 results, overall revenue growth was 6%. Storage internal growth was solid at 3%, reflecting consistent underlying trends. North America reported 3% internal storage growth and international growth remained strong at 6%. Net global Records Management volume growth was about 2% again, on a year-to-year basis in Q3, reflecting continued strong gains in international and modest year-on-year growth in North America. Pricing trends remain consistent. Total service internal growth was 2%. Core service internal growth was down 1% in the quarter. We continue to see pressure on core service activity, particularly in North America related to soft economic conditions. Strong growth in Hybrid services are partially offsetting these impacts, but we expect that overall core service growth will be constrained in coming quarters, as we continue to build scale in the Hybrid business. Complementary service revenues, which represent about 12% of total revenues, increased 9% internally in the quarter. Results reflected benefits from higher recycled paper pricing, which offset lower revenues from international projects and other miscellaneous complementary services. Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our year-to-date results. Slide 6 looks at our year-to-date operating performance compared to the first 9 months of 2010. As noted, our Q3 results are keeping us on track to reach our full-year financial targets. For the year-to-date, revenue increased 5% to $2.3 billion. Gross profit increased 5% to $1.3 billion, yielding a modest improvement in gross margin. Adjusted OIBDA grew 2% year-over-year, excluding the $15 million of cost associated with the proxy contest. As expected, adjusted OIBDA growth has been constrained by higher levels of incentive compensation compared to last year, and planned investments in North America sales and marketing. Adjusted EPS was $0.93 per share, including a $0.05 per share impact from the $15 million of cost related to the proxy contest. Excluding these impacts, adjusted EPS is up about 3% year to date. Capital spending was $119 million, excluding $15 million from real estate. In terms of project timing, we're planning for higher capital spending levels in the fourth quarter, consistent with our full-year plans. Our full-year outlook for capital spending has been refined to $225 million. Excluding real estate spending, this will be about 6.8% of revenues, down about 110 basis points from 2010 levels. Free cash flow for 2011 is $305 million year to date, 15% from last year's level, primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and lower capital spending. We remain solidly on track for strong performance in free cash flow this year, with our full-year outlook in the range of $380 million to $400 million. Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review our results by segment. Slide 7 shows key year to date metrics for each of our 3 key segments compared to the first 9 months of 2010. Consistent with our plans, we're sustaining high returns in our North American segment, as we build momentum in our international segment as a driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. Reported revenues year-to-date increased 2%, supported by 2% storage [ph] growth. Adjusted OIBDA margins in our largest segment was strong at 43% [ph] gross margin gains and controlled support overhead spending, which supported planned investments in sales and marketing. These investments are key to sustaining the high return storage annuity, which drives North America returns. Capital efficiency continue to improve with CapEx as a percentage of sales at 4%. Our international segment continues to post solid revenue growth and strong adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. Revenues grew 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued strong storage internal growth of 6%. Year-to-date adjusted OIBDA exceeded revenue gains, growing 23% on reported basis or 14% excluding FX effects. Through Q3, international adjusted OIBDA margins have increased 150 basis points, compared to prior year levels. These gains were driven primarily by realized benefits of operational excellence initiatives in our U.K. business. We continue to target strong improvement in international margins in 2011, supported by operational improvements in the U.K. and profit gains in the expansion markets. The increase in corporate expenses primarily reflects $15 million of onetime costs associated with the proxy contest. Overall, we continue to deliver strong operating performance across our business, which is driving sustained strong cash flow. This performance is supporting significant shareholder payouts. Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our shareholder payout program. Slide 8 shows the substantial progress we've made in returning funds to shareholders over the past 2 years. As contacts, we initiated our first dividend and share repurchase authorization in early 2010, and tripled our annual dividend level late last year. As part of our midterm business plan presented in April, we committed to $2.2 billion of payouts through 2013, including $1.2 billion by May 2012. As part of this commitment, we increased our quarterly dividend against $0.25 per share in June. To date, we've made significant progress against our business plan goals. Through last [indiscernible] returns $726 million of our initial $1.2 billion commitment. In Q3, we acquired 16.8 million shares for $537 million, $7.5 million of these shares were acquired in early August at the completion of our $250 million prepaid variable share repurchase agreements, which we funded in May. The balance was acquired in the open market following the completion of the PVSR. Between October 1 and October 21, we acquired an additional 3 million shares for $91 million. As of October 21, we had $449 million remaining on our existing $1.2 billion share repurchase authorization. Since first announcing our plans to return cash to shareholders in February 2010, we've returned nearly $1 billion through over $200 million of dividend payments and the repurchase of 25 million shares for about $750 million. The 25 million shares represents more than 12% of the shares we had outstanding at the end of 2009. Our strong cash flow and financing capacity has us well-positioned to deliver our payout commitments. Let's now turn to Slide 9 to review how we're managing our balance sheet to fund our business and support these payouts. Our balance sheet remains strong, reflecting improvements in our cash generating capacity and debt portfolio. Our debt portfolio remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate was just under 7%, and we were 85% fixed at quarter end. Maturities is nearly 7 years with no bond payments due until 2014. During the third quarter, we issued 400 million of 7 3/4% senior subordinated notes. This transaction is consistent with our plans to increase our leverage ratio to the -- within the 3% to 4% target leverage range. Currently, our consolidated leverage ratio was about 3% -- I am sorry 3.0x. We expect our leverage ratio to increase moderately within our target range as planned as we continue to execute it against our shareholder payout program. We're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was approximately $1.2 billion, with $481 million in cash and $671 million in additional borrowing capacity under our revolver. The strength of our balance sheet will enable us to continue to fund value creating growth in our business and continued payouts to shareholders. That concludes our review of the quarterly results. Overall, our business performance was solid as expected, and we remain on track towards our full-year goals. Let's now turn to Slide 10 to review our 2011 outlook. Slide 10 summarizes our full-year 2011 financial guidance. For 2011, our business [indiscernible] performing as expected, and within our previous guidance ranges. As noted earlier, we're revising our full-year guidance to reflect current foreign currency exchange rates and about $10 million of projected restructuring costs, we expect to incur in Q4 related to our Western European operations. We expect our full-year revenues to be in the range of $3,020,000,000 to $3,045,000,000, up about 4% over 2010. This reflects expectations for internal growth of about 2%, consistent with year-to-date trends, and about 2% of benefit from foreign exchange and acquisitions combined. Since we've last updated, the dollar has strengthened against all other [ph] foreign currencies. At recent trading ranges, we estimate this will reduce our full-year growth benefit that we expected from FX by about 1%. Our adjusted OIBDA outlook is now $905 million to $925 million. At midpoint this is down $15 million, compared to our prior guidance reflecting the projected $10 million of restructuring cost we expect to incur in Q4, as well as some impacts from the FX changes. The restructuring cost as a result of the finalization of improvement plans in certain Western European markets. They're onetime in nature, are primarily headcount related, and support our future international margin expansion goals. Our current outlook is for adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.24 per share. This outlook includes a $0.05 negative impact from proxy related costs and $0.03 impact related to the international restructuring cost. Our adjusted EPS forecast assumes 197 million shares outstanding. This assumption includes the benefit of shares that we've repurchased through October 21. Our CapEx outlook of $225 million includes about $18 million for real estate spending. As noted, our free cash flow outlook remains strong with projections in the range of $380 million to $400 million. Now let's turn to Slide 11 and discuss the key drivers of our preliminary 2012 outlook. Slide 11 highlights key factors supporting our preliminary outlook for our 2012 financial performance. We're currently targeting 0% to 2% internal revenue growth in 2012, supported by a continued solid storage internal growth. This growth outlook is consistent with our current trends, adjusting for an expected 1% negative impact from lower recycled paper prices. Recycled paper prices are down nearly $80 a ton, or more than 25% since August. At current levels, we estimate this change will lower revenue and profits by about $25 million in 2012. Assuming foreign-exchange levels remain at recent levels, FX impacts with lower reported year-end revenue growth by about 1%. We're targeting solid underlying gains in adjusted OIBDA, supported by an additional 150 to 200 basis points of margin expansion in our international segment. The favorable lapping of onetime costs associated with our proxy cost and projected international restructuring costs in 2011 will be offset by lower recycled paper pricing impacts in 2012. We also expect to drive a continued solid free cash flow and adjusted EPS growth. Our free cash flow outlook is supported by projections for higher operating profits and slightly lower capital spending, which will offset the higher interest expense related to our planned increase in leverage. Adjusted EPS will benefit from lower shares outstanding, reflecting benefits for our accelerated share repurchases in 2011. Let's turn to Slide 12 to summarize our 2012 outlook. On a constant dollar basis, we're targeting 0% to 2% revenue growth, and 1% to 5% adjusted OIBDA growth. Please note that these growth rates don't include any benefit from future core acquisitions, as contacts acquisitions added about 1% to our growth rates since 2001. As noted, we're planning for similar revenue growth trends, and for moderate margin gains supported by continued improvements in international, consistent with our business plan. On a reported basis, this outlook supports our preliminary revenue guidance of between $2,990,000,000 and $3,070,000,000 and adjusted OIBDA of $915 million to $955 million. These estimates include a negative 1% impact from FX using recent trading ranges for the dollar. Our outlook is for continued strong free cash flow performance in the range of $360 million to $400 million reflecting solid operating performance and mostly lower capital expenditures of about $220 million for the year. Our CapEx outlooks include increased expenditures on operational efficiency investments to drive future margin gains, and about $16 million for real estate. Our outlook is for adjusted EPS to grow between 1% and 10% to a range of $1.22 to $1.33, reflecting benefits from profit gains and lower shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest costs. Our adjusted EPS set calculation assumes 185 million shares outstanding. This reflects shares repurchased through October 21, 2011, and does not incorporate any future potential repurchases. This outlook for 2012 is preliminary, it's based on current FX rates, paper prices and shares outstanding. Any and all of which can change material in short periods of time. We'll update our outlook again in our Q4 earnings call to reflect changes, if any, in these variables. Thank you and we'd now be happy take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Richard, I've known you for a decade now and you usually don't speak so much about the economy given the nature of Iron Mountain's business, but in your opening remarks, you mentioned the economy quite a bit. Does that frame your guidance for 2012? And in particular, why is it fair to assume current trends now in terms of internal growth continue into 2012?
C. Richard Reese: Well I guess the reason I didn't talk about the economy in the past is we've really never seen such an impact. And look, part of the reason was when we had good economic growth, we've never seen the economy come down quite like this in my lifetime, and when you're operating down with small numbers on growth rates, everything going on, plusses and minuses, have an amplification, and so it's just more painful. Why should we -- what then, 2 questions on that. We have done a reasonable amount of work just convincing ourselves to make sure that what we're telling you is right, that this is the impact of the economy, and not an acceleration of secular trends. I'm not suggesting that there aren't secular trends because there are there always have been and will continue, but all the data I look at says that we are being impacted by the economy when you see the rate at which it came off and the fact that services came down first and a year later, storage growth rates came down. And you understand the nature of what we do for customers, it all makes sense. But in terms of why is it fair to project the same trends going forward is, 2 things, we're not in the business of projecting the economy. So I don't know what it's going to do. Second is, at least I [ph] understand it, there's a rebound. We'll be a significant lag to that. So it -- for its impact 2012, we'd all have to be feeling real good about the economy taking off right now, and I don't know anybody that feels good about that. Third is, my tea leaves. When I read the tea leaves about the global situation, the overleverage of the world, you name it, problems, I don't see any major changes and a positive impact for a couple of years, at least. So we're running our business on the basis that nothing good is, nothing positive from the outside is going to happen for us. And so we're controlling expenses tightly, and we're digging for revenue. And we're doing some really good things and we are improving with the business. We're getting productivity in our sales force, our bookings are up. Some of the flow-through rate is slow. We're having some cases, some slowdown in getting boxes to move from competitors where we've had some switchings going on. Everybody's holding on tighter to what they have. But net, net of that, the team's working hard, and our forecast for next year is the sum total of a lot of assumptions and a lot of people committing to make these things happen.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann of William Blair and Company.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I wanted to talk a little bit about the restructuring efforts in Europe and some of the headcount reductions. This is kind of -- now that you're done with the strategic review there, is this kind of a onetime thing, or do you think that there could be more to go as you implement the full part of this plan?
Brian P. McKeon: We've identified the bulk of the changes that we need to make. I would say that there's always the potential that we, as we move things forward, there may be selective things that we might do, for example, facility consolidations or other changes in the plan. We'll try to highlight those for you. I think we're identifying the big changes right now and expect this will primarily hit in Q4. Our future outlook doesn't -- 2012 doesn't incorporate any additional charges. So the sum is -- this should be the bulk of it, and there's always a potential we may move from something forward, and if we do move something forward, it's something that would be tied to having an incremental benefit for us, and we'll make sure to highlight that discreetly for you.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, great. And then now Richard, just if you could expand just quickly on the last point a little bit, in terms of some of the offensive things that you are doing in terms of whether it's productivity, increased bookings, attacking the unvended market, I'm just wondering if you elaborate on a few of those things. Give us a little bit of color in terms of attacking even a sluggish environment.
C. Richard Reese: Sure. Look, people ask me that question and I hate to sound like a broken record, we're going to be doing what I'm about to tell you about for 10 years. So it takes time and it takes - it's a repetitive sort of thing, but we're seeing impact. The strategy basically is in our core businesses, there's more market opportunity, but you got to dig deeper to find it. And so it's about how you segment the markets, and how you tailor your [indiscernible] segments. And frankly, just getting more sophisticated, and [indiscernible] is not been something that we've ever had to do, and that marketing is driven towards supporting our sales organization, which is driving our efficiency up. We're selling more dollars of revenue per dollar of cost. All those things we're doing to -- and that's just good blocking and tackling. So there's nothing that goes bingo, you light it up. This is not the kind of business we'll put out a promotion program and run an ad on the Super Bowl, and your revenue will go up. This is blocking and tackling, that we started I'd say a year plus ago, and we'll continue to do it. We're seeing impact. As you know, a positive there but it's still early, we're still in the investment cycle. We don't intend to increase it next year. If someone asked me why wouldn't you? And the answer is let see what we did, let's see it flow through, let's make sure it proves out, and if it does, maybe come 2013, we'll think about doing something else but, it's kind of where we are.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of Barclays Capital.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: The first question, I'd guess I was trying -- in your PowerPoint, it's -- when it looks at the international segment, it says internal growth was 2%, and everything you talked about was 5% or 6% for Storage in constant currency. What's the difference there between this 6% constant currency and the 2% internal?
Brian P. McKeon: It's basically, we're rolling over a large project in Europe that's rolling off. And --
C. Richard Reese: The acquisition is the difference between the 5% and the 2%. The Polish acquisition we completed at the beginning of the year.
Brian P. McKeon: That's right. They're about 3 points of benefit.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And so, how should we think about that 2% internal. That's obviously -- that's a slowdown from what it's been doing I think, and below, I think, what was implied by the plan that you provided earlier this year to get to 2013 target. Is that something that we should expect, would accelerate based on what you're doing, or is the economy in Europe hurting, or is the restructuring efforts that you're doing may be hurting the top line, but being done to drive the bottom line, any a color on that?
Brian P. McKeon: Gary, that's what I was trying to answer. If you look at the storage rate, we've been very consistently, solidly in the 5% to 6% range. And the current quarter, we had an impact of rolling over. We had a large nonrecurring contract in Western Europe that we're rolling over as we look forward into next year.
C. Richard Reese: And by the way, it's a large contract in a country in which we are rolling over as in we are firing the customer because we don't like the margin profile. But that impacts the services side, the core fundamental storage is still growing 5% range, and that's what we forecasted going forward. Once we've cycled through those numbers, you'll see the services growth rates pick back up. It's more of a math exercise relative to that.
Brian P. McKeon: It's very much consistent trends. I think what we're dealing with is excluding some of the changes in the paper pricing, which are very recent. We're targeting solid 5% growth next year in Europe. And the business performance has been excellent. It's consistently good growth, margin gains right on track, return on improvement right on track. We feel very good about the international business. So very consistent with our plans.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then a quick follow-up, Richard, I think you'd mentioned the core services impacted by the economy but then you also said there was a minor issue in the healthcare market. Can you just expand upon that?
C. Richard Reese: Sure. Healthcare, and this is primarily a North American phenomenon, where we have a bigger mix of healthcare than we do around the world. As you know, healthcare has gone through all kinds of changes, and healthcare is a business with us that's a relatively small amount of our storage, but a reasonable amount of our core services. And the activity rates on that have been coming off, frankly have been coming off for over 10 years. This is not brand new. But as I said, when everything else slows down in your business, you start to see some of these underlying things. As the healthcare, and the acceleration of it is the -- is our government spending somewhere between $45 million and $100 million of $100 billion to computerize healthcare records. What happens is, is the activity rates is their records age is coming off as they're going to the electronic medical record to find access on a patient care basis. Now, we've studied it carefully, and what you'll find is the we're still going through the early adopters cycle, they intend to drop their activity rate it tends to -- it's like an S-curve. It tends to come down and settle, because they still need access to those physical records for a variety of reasons, but about half of our -- we used to figure about half of our activity in that space was related to patient care events and the other half is related to billing audits and to research and all kinds of other things. The storage side of that business is holding up, because they're keeping their records, but those are becoming deader faster. And by the way, unfortunately, that'll -- we've really done some pretty deep customer -- of our customer analysis as to adoption rates and everything else. We've got a few more years to eat through that piece of the change. It's a very slow evolving thing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann of Baird.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I wanted to dig a little bit into the margin expansion in international and just make sure first I'm doing the math right in terms of how you're applying the margin growth and then just ask a couple of questions. So looks like about 150 basis points of margin expansion's realized so far this year, implied in -- at the midpoint of guidance looks like another 70 basis points at the corporate level, which probably means if you assume North America is flat, that's about another 280 implied internationally. So we're somewhere in the, I don't know, 400 basis points range of margin expansion implied through next year? Is that about the right math and then, you feel like you can -- you get the rest of the way there in '13?
Brian P. McKeon: I'm not quite following your math. Let me try to lay out the progression of the margins, but we were on track for about a 200 basis point improvement this year in international, 150 year-to-date and we'll have additional benefit flowing through in Q4. That excludes the restructuring costs. Just want to be clear that we view with the restructuring as onetime in nature, and not impacting the underlying operations. As we look forward in next year, we're targeting another 150 to 200 basis point improvement. So and we would project to -- we're not talking about 2013 today, but we're expecting to continue on that trajectory consistent with our business plan. So we've had a very nice step up this year, expect to continue that next year. It's not quite as high as the math that you are backing into there, but definitely a significant improvement.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes, it's hard to explain over the phone. That matches what I was calculating. How does the European economic environment impact your ability and your confidence in hitting the ultimate goal? I mean, clearly this has changed a lot since you initially laid out the plan. I just kind of want to hear philosophically how you think you get the --
Brian P. McKeon: The bulk of the things that we're implementing on margin improvement -- I mean this has been a long-term strategy. So this isn't something that we've just started, I mean we've been positioning ourselves for this for some time. But it is within our control. This is operational improvements, cost initiatives, many of the things that we implemented in North America. So we feel very good about that. I think there's always the risk of impacts on the margin related to the economy. We can't control things like fluctuations in paper pricing and that can have some impact on the margin. We actually think we'll be able to manage that effectively next year, from a return point of view. But there's always the risk that you can have some pressure on the margin with services and --
C. Richard Reese: Yes, and look, our forecast -- we've said we're not in the business of trying to -- do economic forecasts. We're not -- if we were good at that, we wouldn't be working so hard. We'll make our money other ways. We are basically assuming the economies will be what they are or in other words, our activity patterns all over the same. The European business is, by and large, are not as active relative to storage as our North America business. It's a mixed business, mix and market maturity kind of issues of what people choose to outsource and so forth. And then -- and remember that our internationals is a combination of -- for the U.K., Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and then pull out some of the other parts of that, we call break. But we get still, a good strong growth in our emerging market segments, so those things. And although the core material markets are bigger, the likely decline or change in fluctuation in activity rates given their level of activity in general. Hopefully as long as the rest of the world, that is the emerging markets hold up. They'll likely cover those. I'm not guaranteeing it but, that's kind of how we think about it.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just there happens to be a fairly large business model out there that is noted for sale, may be as a whole or in parts. How does that impact your ability or desire to return capital along the plan that you've laid out? I mean are the 2 items of potentially doing M&A, and doing the return of capital to shareholders usually exclusive, or how do you factor in that new variable?
C. Richard Reese: A lot of variables in our business. We've made a commitment to our shareholders and we're going to meet that commitment. But other than that, I don't think I could give comment on what else we might or might not do.
Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: All right. And then, Brian, just with interest rates being low here, we're obviously you're active in the bond market this past quarter, I know lots of your existing debt have got some level of pre-penalties. Is there any opportunities in the capital structure and the debt financing to take advantage of today's low rates?
Brian P. McKeon: Well, I don't know -- rates today are low, but yes, it's yesterday and today, but changes frequently. But we did a lot of optimization on our front and we'll always look at that. But I think we've termed out our debt pretty well, and don't have anything that's obvious in the immediate term. Which is something we'll always look at. But I think for right now, we're pretty -- we've done the work to position us well for the first phase of this initial payout commitment, and we'll continue to evaluate it but nothing significant right now that we'd -- makes sense for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Richard, could you help us understand why you think you should [ph] spend between -- on that service level activities, lagging storage as opposed to leading over the last cycle? And then just, you should think about healthcare as a percentage of service, overall relative to the storage business, can you help us frame out kind of the revenue contribution from healthcare as opposed to other end markets?
C. Richard Reese: The reason I think is it's changed is, is look -- any prior period where we've seen significant economic weakness, quite frankly is, we were in a high acquisition mode and anything that was going on, on the margin, you didn't see that well, okay? Second is, so it may -- what I'm really saying is it may have happened and we didn't see it. In my lifetime, as I've said I've never lived anything as dramatic as this, and any bad recession we've seen is peanuts compared to this, and I'd like to say we were going pretty fast in the middle of it anyway. So I think it probably got masked. It's logical though, for that to happen in this case because if you think about what we do is on the way up for a customer, our whole portfolio of customers are growing. On average, they send us data that's say, probably on average, 18 months old. So on the way up, what they're creating today, since their activity of creation is higher as -- the larger they are, the more transaction, the more activity or what they're creating today, what they created 18 months ago was lower, okay, and we're getting at 18 months later, we're getting it today. But their service activities, halfway to retrieving, is directly related to the rate of creation. So on the way up, people create data. We see higher service transactions as they retrieve and deal with it and as the business activities going on, but we don't see the storage until later. And if they're moving up, it's 18 months later that they're building that we'll see 18 months at the best a bigger number out. I don't know if that makes sense, but that's the underlying trend. On the way down, it's just the opposite. We saw the service decline a year before. We saw the storage decline. Okay? On the way down, it's their service activities and their business, is coming down and they're not using information as much. And therefore, not creating residual archival data for us to store as much. We won't see the storage until later, and -- but we'll see the service when they're stop doing it. So I think those are the general trends that caused that. And quite frankly, Kevin, I've missed your second question so you might repeat it.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Healthcare.
C. Richard Reese: Oh, you wanted me to mention healthcare a little bit is that what you're asking for?
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Yes, just if you think about healthcare as a percentage of the service revenue relative to what percentage of storage it is?
Brian P. McKeon: It's about 10%. Healthcare, as a segment overall, is about 10% of the business. It's more service weighted, because it tends to be a more active file or ancient records, and that has been a headwind for us. I mean, we've seen double-digit declines in the service, active service revenue, around healthcare as expected, with things like x-ray going away. It'd been going away for quite a period of time as well as some of the shift to EMR. We have offsets to that in terms of things like Hybrid revenue growing and actually in our Hybrid business, healthcare is one of our fastest growing segments.
C. Richard Reese: And look, if you roll out over time, and look in the next 2 or 3 years, we expect to see continued pressure on the core services in North America for this trend. If the economy picks up, it will over wash it. The trend of our broad portfolio will over wash that. It might. The healthcare will keep that rebound suppressed a little bit, but it will wash over the negative side of it. If you look out into the broader future, one of the strategic reasons is a variety of reasons why we went with the Hybrid business, but one of them was recognizing that some of this will happen. I mean healthcare, you can see coming 10 years ago. It was easy to see where that business has to go, and so forth. And our DMS business or Hybrid business, growth rates will eventually [indiscernible] but I mean in terms of the size and magnitude will actually also get what that will contribute to the positive side of it. And our DMS business is, if you think about it, is the counter strategy to decrease inactivity records. One of the things that happens when they decrease the activity in their physical records is, the -- they change of the workflow processes, they apply different technologies and they also have to deal with a hybrid document, that is, they have to deal with legacy paper as well as often times current paper in a mixed environment. And that's what our DMS or Hybrid business deals with.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Got it, super. And then just what assumption are you assuming per ton for recycled paper in the 2013 guidance, or 2012, rather?
Brian P. McKeon: We basically take the most recent -- it correlates with the most recent reported SOP rates what's -- was in the little north of 200.
Operator: Our last question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: The -- I'm looking at Slide 14, Global Records Management volume growth drivers and noticing destructions, it might be something seasonal looking at the pattern, but destructions picking up. Could you speak to that a little bit?
Brian P. McKeon: It's actually down year-on-year, so it is -- there are some seasonal impacts. You can see by the nature of the chart on Slide 14, that destructions, they're driven by episodic events, so let's say the overall trend in destructions has been quite stable coming off the peaks that we saw kind of in 2009. So I wouldn't read too much into the one quarter change. I will also, though, caveat that we always -- this is an area that you can have fluctuations driven by significant events.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Sure. And then moving right to the top of that chart, looks like a trend down in the volume growth for -- from the pattern. Could you speak to volume and price, to just a dynamic in general, what you're seeing on both of those elements?
Brian P. McKeon: The storage volume overall has been -- we certainly saw a decline coming out of our peaks at 2008, and the economic effects through 2009. I think since then our storage trends have been more stable. The -- this quarter, we've reporting it was about 2% year-on-year. North America was up. International continues strong. Pricing is in a consistent range. So really more consistency than different I think, what you're seeing on the trend here is more the transition from the high single-digit rates that we are at in 2008 and pre- the [ph] crisis to 2% to 3% range that we've been in more recently. So I think it's one thing to gives us confidence on our outlook is we do feel good about the storage side of the equation and stability there, and hopefully with some benefits from economic improvement and some pull through from some of our sales initiatives we can prove that over time.
Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And one more if I may, just North America, the margin outlook that you have there, what just what you've been seeing recently, and where do you think that'll go?
Brian P. McKeon: It implies relatively stable margins, consistent with our plans, there's a little bit of pressure from the paper change, because that -- a big swing like that, to move over 25% in 2 months and that's that tends to pull right through to the bottom line in the short term. So we'll have some moderate pressure there but on balance, it's sustaining the high returns that we have. It's consistent with the business plan we've talked about. I would just take a step back and say overall in the business, we feel quite good about the margin side of the equation. We're managing North America, consistent with what we've discussed. We've got international on the right track. I think the growth side, we have some macro pressures from things like FX and paper. The underlying trends are where they've been and we're working through the tough economy. But I think on the margin side, we feel like we're executing very well, consistent with our plans.
C. Richard Reese: So in summary, thank you for all for joining us in Q3 and year-to-date performance. As Brian just said and I don't totally want to repeat ourselves, we as a management team and a company actually feel good about what we're doing relative to the environment we're operating in. We're making significant progress towards the -- improving our business, towards meeting our goals in our strategic plan and we're staying very focused on how we think about these kinds of issues. This is a business that we are operating for the long haul, and we think we've got a good future ahead of us. So we want to make sure that we're prepared for it when the world changes either way that we can operate in it, and remain with consistent performance, which has been our hallmark for over quite a few years and we'll continue doing that. So thank you all for your support and thanks for your coming today. We ran a little bit over time. I'm -- trick to try to keep these to 1 hour. So we'll try to do better next time. So thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Executives: Brian McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Executive Vice President C. Reese - Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Golden - Vice President of Investor Relations
Analysts: Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Andrew Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research
Operator: Good morning. My name is Bonnie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q2 Earnings Call Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Golden, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Golden: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our 2011 second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Richard Reese, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian McKeon, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we'll open up to questions for your Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for our 2011 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release. Also, please note that all of the financial results presented in today's materials reflect discontinued operations treatment, the digital businesses we sold and the expected sale of our New Zealand operations. All historical results have been restated to conform to this presentation.  With that, I would like to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Richard Reese.
C. Reese: Thanks, Stephen, and good morning, and welcome to our call. This morning, I'll be intentionally brief in that it's summer time, we've had a good quarter, but there's nothing really extraordinary to talk much about. So I'll kind of run through it fairly quickly, then Brian will go through the numbers and some of the details. And then, of course, we will take your questions and answers. Q2 was a good quarter, in line with our expectations. We're on target for the year, and frankly, on target to -- it's a good start for our 3-year plan in terms of the financial performance that we laid out a few months ago. The trends are pretty much in line with Q1, so there's not -- as I said, not a lot specifically to talk about.  Reported revenues were up 5% in total that were led by International, internal growth at 4% and North American internal growth at 1%. Our storage trends remain stable at internal growth of 3% on storage.  As we've been talking about for quite some time, we've seen a moderation in our storage trends. Some of that is economic, and some of that is continued secular pressure. But we've seen stabilization, and that stabilization trends have continued into the quarter. Churn, it's sitting around 7% in organic additions, in the same range of the last 7 quarters, in fact, in around 7%.  New sales at about 2% up of -- which is a moderate improvement, and been improving slowly over the last quarter 2. As you know, we've focused our business since the sell of our digital business on our core business and that we are seeing some benefits of focus and some benefits of getting the sales force really focused back into these core services. As we've said many times, there's a lot of open market opportunity for us, and we've probably diluted our focus a little too much, having too broader product line and too many shiny objects for the sales force. And I think, although we've still got some pretty interesting shiny objects in our core business, getting them focused back on the core seems to be working for us. Core service continued to remain soft for the same trends we've been talking about for some time as we've not seen a pickup in retrieval activities and other core activities. Overall service dollars were up, but that was driven primarily by paper prices for our Shredding business as well as fuel surcharges related to the price of fuel rising over the last few months really kicking in and starting to flow through. But as I said, the core service activity remains soft and remains a drag, not an increase or anything in the trend, but just remains the same trend line and a drag on our overall growth rates.  Financial bottom line performance adjusted OIBDA was, on an operating basis, was up 2%. But that $227 million, that excludes about $10 million of onetime costs. If you will remember, I've been saying for the last quarter or 2 that as we are exiting digital and shifting our strategy to focus on the core and focus on driving returns that you would see some noise in our reported numbers for a couple of quarters. This is sort of some of that noise, and Brian will go through it in details. But it's primarily related to some of the proxy cost items and some other things like that, and you will see in future quarters some onetime costs finishing those things out as well as the special committee process we've talked about and as well as reduce of some of the strategic assets as we go along. So this under the category we've been telling you was coming, and Brian will get into details as we get there. So as I said, it was a good quarter. The organization and the business are performing well. It's performing in line. I think the execution of our team is quite outstanding, and we're not only making good financial progress, we're making good progress of transition our business in terms of our mindset, in terms of our strategy, in terms of dusting off out products a bit, and really focus ourselves back into the core markets. And we expect that, that will pay good rewards over the coming years. So I'd like to review quickly, as I will tend to do in the next few quarters, if not years, is just to keep you up to date on the 4 stages or components of the 3-year plan that we've put forth so everybody understands where we are. And I think one of our commitments was to make sure that we were very transparent and very clear about the progress we're making and so forth. So as you remember, our plan is driven by 4 components. First is our North American business, and that is the business that's -- it's the strength and the backbone of our core services. It's a business over the last few years we've optimized dramatically by taking about 850 basis points of margin improvement in it, as we really went through that business with a fine-toothed comb. So the strategy here is to continue driving revenue and looking for the point at which we can increase more revenue by investing some of our margin back into it and basically keep the business at flat margins. This quarter revenue was up about 1% and margins on an operating basis with some onetime noise in their numbers, but on an operating basis it's basically flat, so it's in line with our expectations. It's a business that's got to work hard to maintain flat margins, because they do have some headwinds in terms of service mixes. Some of our core services are growing quite fast. We have our hybrid lines growing in the 20% to 30% range internally. They are good businesses but with much lower -- different margin characteristics and different capital characteristics and so forth. Whereas the soft revenue we're seeing in our core retrieval refile business, which is coming down on us as the higher-margin mix. So they've got have some headwinds there, but they'll work through it. We're pretty confident that the team can work their way through that and keep the business on line with what we expect to happen. International business, as you know, a couple of things, I mean, our strategy was to look at the business from a different strategic lens, and that is as a portfolio businesses, and we've been going about doing that. As part of that, or in addition to that, I should say, our International business has -- have committed to driving margins by 700 basis points, and this is by running the same playbooks by and large that we ran in North America in terms of just driving efficiency, investing in processes to improve our cost as well as our service delivery. And they're off to a good start. You saw in this quarter a flow-through of 150 basis points and margin improvement out of our International portfolio. That's 150 out of the target of 200 that we will see coming this year, and that's 200 for this year out of the 700 total over the 3-year period. So as I said, we're off to a good start there. Growth remained good in the markets, particularly led by some of our developing markets, as well as some good growth in our leadership markets and otherwise on the continent. And they maintain a 4% internal growth rate. Plus absorbed -- continue to absorb an acquisition, which added another 3% to their growth rate or total growth rate in constant dollars of 7%. FX had a much more positive benefit for them, but we really think about the business in constant-dollar basis. Part of our strategy was in addition to driving the 700 basis points of margin and trying to continue getting access to the higher growth rates that we could see in quite a few of our International markets was to analyze our portfolio of businesses and making sure that we had strategies to drive appropriate returns on invested capital market-by-market. And some of those strategies would include tactics such as driving more revenue to drive to scale, such as reducing cost and overhead, such as freezing the business and just stopping the investment if we couldn't find a better thing to do with it or disposing, divesting in the business and get out of it.  This morning, we announced, are, in fact, stating that we are exploring the sale of one of our businesses, that's our business in New Zealand. This is a result of this process. The process is an ongoing process, not that we haven't pretty much finished the analysis because we have, it's just that we're not going to make a big-bang announcements as to our execution. But this is a first-stage execution of that strategy, and so we're exploring the sale of the business in New Zealand. The way we look at that business, it's a great business, but it's small, about $8 million in revenue. It came along with an acquisition of Australia, which is a much larger business, and New Zealand, in itself, is a smaller market. And we're not the leader. In fact, we're like #3 or #4 in the market space. And therefore, we think that our New Zealand business folded into somebody else probably has more value to them than it does to us. And we're going to test the market and see if we can come to understand that. We obviously won't sell it if we don't get a fair price for it to get return for shareholders, because it's not putting a drag on us. It's a profitable business. But on a return basis, we think we can probably take the capital out there and put it somewhere else and have a better return. As I said, this is the first such announcement. I don't expect a long list of announcements, but -- and the lot of what we're doing in the International portfolio is not the kind of thing you'll announce. It's just about how we drive the business, how we allocate capital. But again, we're off to good start there. The third element of our strategy was to sell our Digital software assets, or what we so-called our Digital business, and focus back on our core business. During the quarter, although we announced this some time ago, it's easy to make an announcement. We actually had to do the work, but we closed on the sale transaction in the quarter and, in fact, had to split the business apart. There was a lot of integrated support and staff issues that we worked through with Autonomy. And the transition is not 100% done, but I'd put it in the category as mostly done. I think the heavy lifting is pretty much behind us there, and we are all looking forward -- I know that Autonomy, I think, views it as a successful and good transaction from their perspective as well as we do.  And along the way, as we had hoped, we entered into a partnership with Autonomy that gave us access to a lot of their technology on an attractive partnership basis, where we will cross-sell and support, which allows us to continue in the market space, ramping technology services in our portfolio where it's appropriate, and allows us to continue to solving certain customer problems without suffering the development cost and the heavy capital investments that we were having to put back in the Digital business to maintain our software assets and platform. So all in all, we think it was a good move for us, and we hope and believe that it was a good move for Autonomy. And we think, as we said in the very first place, that they would do a better job with those assets than we could do. And so we hope and believe they found a good home and that the relationship between us and Autonomy will continue to blossom and bear fruits for both parties. So that stuff is easy to talk about. I just want to stress to you shareholders that you can't even imagine the amount of work that a lot of people have put into over the last 2 or 3 months just making that short soliloquy I just went through come true. Okay? And so it's good work, and the good news is that now, some of those people, we'll give them about 5 minutes rest, and they'll go back to work on some other good stuff. And we'll get our organizational focused on some other future things that are real positive for us. The fourth element is shareholder payouts. The reminder is our commitment is $2.2 billion of distributed cash to our shareholders over a 3-year period and $1.2 billion off of that within the first year. And we are on track to do that. We are in the middle of executing that strategy. We increased our quarterly, or what I call foundational, dividend by 33% during the quarter to $0.25 per quarter. I would encourage you to view that as a increase to a foundational level and view that more of the dividend that's likely, not necessarily, but likely to grow as we grow our cash flows in the future or some related metric. Okay? In other words, as business performance continues to do well, I would expect the dividend to rise. But these are all expectations, not commitments in terms of dividend futures. But that's what I would expect to happen. And then, of course, as you know, what we said over and over, our second strategy for distributing capital and preferred strategy is to buy in our stock. Our strategy for buying in our stock is buy it at or below fair market value based upon our best judgment and our best view of the models at the time and not to be necessarily a trader in the market, because we don't expect that we can out-trade the market. And so, we've executed the first leg of that with a $250 million prepaid variable stock purchase plan. That is almost completed. It should conclude itself sometime in August. We don't have final numbers. I can tell you that our best estimate, and it is only an estimate, is somewhere between 7 million and 8 million shares will have been purchased. And our best estimate at the average price is an acceptable number to us, okay? In the future, just so long as we can buy stock at or below the fair market value from our perspective, we will continue doing that as a way of distributing cash. Obviously, if the stock were to get substantially above what we think are a comfortable position, we would have to use a third alternative, which would be a special dividend, but as I've said over and over, that's not our preferred route, but of course a route we would use if we had to. Because we have made these commitments, we will find one way or other to make those commitments come true. So all in all, I think we're off to a good start in the a shareholder payout plan, and we're going to continue moving forward. The last quick element to update you on before I turn over it over to Brian is we've made a decision not to hold our Annual Investor Day in 2011, which we would typically hold in the October timeframe. So from a planning perspective, people have been asking what's the date? Have we nailed it down? And the answer, we decided not to. The reason we decided not to is a couple, or mostly -- I mean, I could whine and argue as we're awfully busy, and it does take a lot of time. But you don't really care about that, and that's not the main reason. The main reason is, as you know, we've kicked off our special committee process to the Board, where we're looking for strategic alternatives. And we believe that so long as we're in the middle of that special committee process, if we would have a large meeting like an Investor Day, you would all come away very unhappy with answers to your questions, because you would all be asking questions about what's the special committee doing? What are they learning? When are they going to learn something? When are they going to tell us something? And our answer to that question will always be, we're not going to tell you. We try to say it more politely than that, but that would be the answer. We just don't really feel like bringing you in and bring ourselves in and having everybody feel pretty uncomfortable at the end that we didn't tell you anything. So I'm telling you now, we're not going to tell you anything, because we're not going to do differential disclosure to anybody. We're going to work through the process. It will be as transparent as possible when a decision has arrived, that if ever there is a decision, we will tell everybody at the same time, and we will tell them broadly and very deeply and very thoroughly. And so, we just felt like take the noise out of the market and the speculation out of the market, we're not going to do an Investor Day. We will resume Investor Day on a normal pattern in 2012. Obviously, if the special committee comes to conclusions that have radical changes in our business, a pretty good chance we'll do some -- we will find lots of ways to do broad communications, and we may even have an in-person meeting if it needed that level of detailed discussion. But we will find the right way to make sure it's communicated and make sure you all understand it if anything happens. And I stress the big word, if anything happens. I should also tell you, though, that one of the other things we typically accomplished at the Investor Day was a discussion of our preliminary forward-year outlook at that day -- at that meeting, and we will do that in our Q3 earnings call. So you might expect our Q3 earnings call to run slightly longer, because we will make sure that we go through a full discussion of our 2012 outlook -- preliminary outlook on our Q3 call. So that's about the only news for the day. As I said, it's a good quarter. I think we're off to a good start executing all our plans, and we'll continue doing that and continue trying to communicate with you.  With that, let me turn it to Brian, who'll go through the details, and then we'll see.
Brian McKeon: Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everybody. We'll be going through the slides as usual. Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. Our continuing operations delivered solid performance in Q2, keeping us on track towards our full year goals. Results were supported by solid storage revenue growth and improved profit performance in our International business. The quarter revenue growth was 5%, with business trends largely consistent with those that we discussed last quarter. Storage revenues increased 6%, or 3% on an internal growth basis. Global record management net volume was 2%, supported by solid gains in International markets and positive growth in North America. Service revenue internal growth was 1% as strong gains in hybrid services as well as benefits from higher paper prices and increased fuel surcharges offset continued weakness in core service activity levels. Profit and cash flow performance was solid and in line with our expectations, supported by strong gains in our International segment. Adjusted OIBDA was $227 million, up 2% on an operating basis excluding $10 million of fees associated with the recent proxy contest. Adjusted EPS was $0.29 per share, including the $0.03 impact of the $10 million in proxy fees, and free cash flow was $140 million on a year-to-date basis.  Our full year guidance for our continuing operations is very similar to the outlook that we shared in our Q1 conference call. We are revising our guidance to reflect the discontinued operations treatment resulted from the sale of our digital businesses and the expected divestiture of our New Zealand operations. The results of these 2 businesses have been removed from our P&L results and collapsed into a single line, labeled income or loss from discontinued operations. All of our historical information has been restated to reflect this presentation. Attached to this presentation is an appendix that contains a table which lays out the impact of discontinued operations in our previously reported Q1 results. In our full year guidance, we've also refined our outlook to reflect current commodity price levels as well as impacts from stranded costs related to the digital divestiture. Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin the review of our financial results. Slide 4 compares our results for in this quarter to the second quarter of 2010. Please note that all the periods presented have been restated to reflect our discontinued operations. Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter, with performance keeping us on track towards achieving our full year financial goals. Enterprise revenue growth was 5%, supported by internal growth of 2% and benefits from favorable FX changes and recent acquisitions. Enterprise revenue gains reflected sustained storage revenue internal growth of 3% and global expansion of hybrid services. Higher fuel surcharges and recycled paper prices also supported revenue growth. These gains offset continued softness in core service activities. From segment perspective, North America posted 1% internal growth, supported by consistent 2% storage internal growth. Service revenues were up slightly in Q2 in North America. Service growth continues to be constrained by softness in retrieval and refile transportation and data protection handling activity. These impacts offset strong gains in hybrid revenues and benefits from higher commodity prices. As noted in today's press release, our Q2 results, specifically North America, include a $6 million revenue adjustment for the estimated cumulative impact of complex retroactive pricing adjustments involving a unique 5-year customer agreement. We've excluded this adjustment from our internal growth calculations as it relates primarily to prior periods and doesn't accurately reflect the current trends in our business. Our International segment generated 4% internal growth in Q2. Storage internal growth remains strong at 5%, supported by solid gains in Europe and sustained double-digit gains in Latin America and Asia Pacific. These gains were augmented by expansion in hybrid service revenues. Total service growth was constrained by lower complementary service revenues, due primarily to the winding-down of a large European contract. Reported revenues for this segment were 19%, including benefits from favorable foreign exchange, rate changes and recent acquisitions. Overall, we continue to post solid comparable profit gains in line with our expectations.  Gross profits grew 5% in Q2, yielding a gross margin of 59.2%, consistent with Q2 of last year. Both storage and service gross margins were flat compared to the prior year. With in-service gross margins, gains from factors such as higher recycled paper prices were offset by the business mix impacts and declines in core service activity. Adjusted OIBDA was $227 million, up 2% excluding $10 million in costs associated with our recent proxy contest. Gross profit gains were offset by planned year-on-year increases in North America sales and marketing expense and normal incentive compensation accruals compared to low prior year levels. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $73 million and amortization was $7 million, and other expense for the quarter was $3 million. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.29 per share, including a $0.03-per-share impact of the proxy cost recorded in the quarter. Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.32 a share, reflecting the benefit of a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. Structural tax rate for the quarter was 39%. Expect the structural tax rate for 2011 as a whole to also be about 39%. Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange. Also presented are the revised Q1 and full year 2011 growth rates reflecting our discontinued operations. As noted, overall revenue growth was 5%, on track with our full year growth outlook. Storage internal growth was sustained at 3%, reflecting consistent underlying trends. North America reported 2% internal storage growth, and International growth remains solid at 5%. Net global records management volume growth was about 2% year-on-year in Q2. I'll break down key drivers of this change as part of today's review. Pricing trends also remain consistent, with net pricing gains of about 2% in North America Records Management. Total service internal growth was 1% compared to 0% growth in the first quarter. Core service internal growth was flat in the quarter compared to down 1% in Q1 as higher fuel surcharges and strong growth in hybrid services offset continued weakness and core service activity levels. Complementary service revenues, which represent about 12% of total revenues, increased 4% internally in the quarter. Results reflected benefits from higher recycled paper pricing, which offset lower fees from customer terminations, and lower project revenue. Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review global volume growth trends. Slide 6 shows key drivers of global records management volume for the last 3.5 years to give you a sense of volume growth dynamics following the financial crisis. The chart shows annualized changes in quarterly record management's volume as a percentage of beginning cubic feet, related to new sales and volume growth from exiting -- from existing customers, offset by outgoing volume, or churn.  Overall, global records management volumes have stabilized following impacts from the economic contraction. Global volume growth was about 2% year-on-year in Q2, similar to trends in recent quarters, with gains supported by growth in International expansion markets.  By region, North America volume was up modestly year-on-year. We're seeing the benefits from our increased focus on new sales supported by targeted investment. We're also seeing moderation in factors such as permanent withdrawals and terminations. On balance, volume is solid in North America, and we're making progress in building new sales momentum that will offset secular impacts and sustain the high-return North America annuity over the long term.  International growth is continuing at a solid pace, with volume up nearly 6% year-on-year. We saw year-on-year volume gains across all regions, with overall gains supported by strong growth and expansion markets like central Europe and Latin America. On a global basis, total churn remains stable. We expect quarterly fluctuations on this front, driven by episodic customer actions, and overall, these impacts have settled into a stable range. In some, our storage annuity is solid and growing, and our investments and long-term strategy are aligned with expanding this annuity, driving attractive incremental returns. Let's move now to Slide 7 and review our results on a year-to-date basis. Slide 7 looks at our year-to-date operating performance compared to the first half of 2010. Again, all periods presented here have been restated to reflect our discontinued operations. As we noted, our Q2 results keep us on track to achieve our full year financial goals. For year-to-date, revenue increased 4% to $1.5 billion, gross profit increased 4% to $882 million, yielding a modest improvement in gross margin. Adjusted OIBDA were 2% year-on-year, excluding the $14 million of costs associated with the proxy contest. Adjusted OIBDA growth was also impacted by planned investments in North America sales and marketing, the higher levels of incentive compensation compared to last year. Adjusted EPS was $0.56 per share, including a 4%-per-share impact from the $14 million of costs related to the proxy contest. Excluding these impacts, adjusted EPS is up 7% year-to-date. Capital spending was $73 million, including $9 million for real estate, in line with our full year plans. Free cash flow for 2011 is $140 million year-to-date, down slightly from last year's levels due primarily to timing impacts on working capital items, including taxes and prepaid assets. These impacts more than offset higher income from continuing operations and lower CapEx. We remain on track for a strong free cash flow performance this year. Let's now turn to Slide 8 to review our results by segment. Slide 8 shows key metrics for each of our 3 segments for the first half of 2010. Consistent with our plans, we're sustained high returns in our North America segment as we build momentum in our International segment as a driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continues to deliver high profits and strong cash flows. Reported revenues year-to-date have increased 1%, supported by 2% storage revenue growth.  Looked at the North American results, we're impacted by the $6 million revenue adjustment described earlier. Adjusted OIBDA margins in our largest segment were strong at 42% on gross margin gains and controlled support overhead spending, which offset planned investments in sales and marketing. As noted earlier, these investments are key to sustaining the high-return storage annuity which drives North America returns. Capital efficiency continued to improve, with CapEx as a percentage of sales decreasing to below 4%. Our International segment continues to post solid revenue growth and improved adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. External growth for the first half was 4%, driven by continued strong storage internal growth of 6%. Year-to-date adjusted OIBDA exceeded revenue gains, growing 17% on a reported basis or 10% excluding FX impacts. Q2 International adjusted OIBDA margins increased 110 basis points compared to prior year levels. These gains were driven primarily by realized benefits of operational excellence initiatives in our U.K. business. We continue to target strong improvement in International margins in 2011, supported by operational improvements in the U.K. and profit gains in expansion markets. Finally, the increase in corporate expenses primarily reflects $14 million of onetime costs associated with the proxy contest. Let's turn to Slide 9 to review our progress with respect to our debt portfolio. Our balance sheet remains strong, reflecting the improvements in our cash-generating capacity and debt portfolio. Currently, our consolidated leverage ratio was 2.8x, at the low end of our target 3x to 4x leverage range. We're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was approximately $1 billion, with $271 million in cash, $718 million in additional borrowing capacity under our revolver. This includes the benefits of the net proceeds from the digital sale. During the second quarter, we refinanced our senior credit facility, securing a $725 million revolving credit facility, $500 million in term loans. These facilities mature in June of 2016. Our debt portfolio remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate was just over 7%. We're 83% fixed at quarter end. Maturity is nearly 7 years with no bond prepayments due until 2014. Strength of our balance sheet reinforces our confidence in advancing the shareholder payout commitments outlined in our strategic plan.  Let's now turn to Slide 10 to discuss our progress on this front. A key component of our midterm strategic plan is our commitment to significant shareholder payouts. As a reminder, we've committed to $2.2 billion of payouts through 2013, including $1.2 billion by May of 2012. In Q2, we advanced key elements of our plan to meet those commitments. In June, we increased our quarterly dividend 33% to $0.25 per share, or $1 on an annual basis. The quarterly dividend is the foundation of our payout approach. It's now at an appropriate level, and we expect to increase it over time as our earnings and free cash flow grow. In Q2, we also increased our share repurchase authorization by $815 million to an aggregate total of $1.2 billion. As of the end of Q2, we've purchased a total of 5.1 million shares for an aggregate of $122 million. Although we do not repurchase any shares during the second quarter, we did implement a $250 million prepaid variable share repurchase program. This program is expected to be concluded in early August, at which time we will receive and retire the shares acquired on our behalf. We expect to retire between 7 million and 8 million shares through this program, which represents about 4% of our total shares outstanding. At the completion of the prepaid repurchase plan, we will have $828 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. At current prices, this represents about 12% of our market cap. We also have significant incremental borrowing capacity as our leverage ratio stands at 2.8x at the end of the second quarter. Over time, we intend to increase our leverage at the midpoint of our target 3x to 4x range, consistent with our strategic plan. Strong cash flow and financing capacity has us well positioned to deliver substantial payouts to shareholders. Let's now turn to Slide 11 to discuss our full year outlook. Slide 11 summarizes our full year 2011 financial guidance. As noted, we're revising our guidance to reflect the discontinued operations treatment of the sale of our Digital business and the expected divestiture of our New Zealand operations. We're also making a modest revision to our revenue guidance to incorporate current commodity price levels.  Let me take you through the components of the outlook. We expect our full year revenues to be in the range of $3,040,000,000 to $3,090,000,000, up 4% to 6%, or up 2% to 4% on a constant currency basis. The outlook results in a reduction of $188 million at the midpoint of the range from our last guidance, primarily reflecting the elimination of the Digital and New Zealand revenues, partially offset by modest positive revisions reflecting the higher commodity prices. After adjusting for discontinued operations, our outlook for adjusted OIBDA is to be in the range of $916 million to $944 million. This range represents reported growth of minus 2% to plus 1% and includes planned incremental sales and marketing investments and a return to normal incentive compensation levels, compared to low levels in 2010. Our outlook for adjusted OIBDA from continuing operations is consistent with our last forecast shared in the Q1 call. Modest positive impact of higher commodity prices on revenues is being offset by stranded costs in connection with the sale of the Digital business as well as higher fuel costs. Included in our adjusted OIBDA outlook is $15 million of advisory and onetime fees associated with our recent proxy contest or reduced overall growth by about 2% this year. Our current outlook is for adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.27 per share. This is an increase of about 3% from our prior guidance, reflecting accretive benefits from the digital divestiture. This outlook also includes the $4 million -- $0.04 negative impact from proxy-related cost. The forecast assumes 202 million shares outstanding. This reflects the level of shares outstanding at the end of Q2. It does not include the impact of the $250 million prepaid variable share repurchase program, which was not completed in Q2. Adjusted EPS would benefit by about $0.01 to $0.02 per share if we receive the 7 million to 8 million shares we're expecting at the completion of this repurchase program. G&A is expected to be approximately $324 million, and interest is expected to be approximately $199 million. The CapEx outlook of $230 million reflects the impact of discontinued operations and includes about $20 million for real estate spending, an increase of $5 million related to a new opportunity. Our free cash flow outlook remains strong, with projections in the range of $370 million to $405 million. In summary, Q2 was a solid quarter, and kept us on track towards our full year goals for improving revenue growth, continued strong profit and cash flow performance.  Thanks, and we'd now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Brian, could you give me -- remind us of the split of the Digital impact between the Storage business and service? Is it all in storage or service, or is it a combination of both?
Brian McKeon: It's a combination of both, Kevin. So we had -- keep in mind that the -- there certainly was a storage component to it, but particularly for the backup businesses, the archiving business, but the eDiscovery business was -- much of that would be under flow through or competitor -- complementary revenue line. So it was a mix.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: And was it kind of 70:30, 60:40 in terms of percentages, or...
Brian McKeon: Why don't we get that for you, and we'll comment on it in a moment. We'll just look that up for you.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Super. And then I just wanted to spend a minute, if we could, on kind of the capital structure. Given the strength of the balance sheet on a go-forward basis, it still seems you're pretty well geared towards fixed debt, things like that. And just given the strength of the free cash flow, is there any difference in terms of approach as you think about uses of free cash flow on a go-forward basis or the leverage on the balance sheet? I mean, I know you've tweaked that the leverage ratios a little bit more recently, but just given the strength of the free cash flow on a go-forward basis, how are you thinking about that capital structure?
C. Reese: Kevin, this is Richard. I think when we put forth our 3-year plan, you'll note that we -- that part of that plan is increasing our leverage to the midpoint of our range, to approximately 3.5x from about 2.8x, a little under 3x now. And I think that's a comfort level we have to operate the business, and that's the level in which, between that increase in the level and our free cash flow, we're going to distribute the $2.2 billion of cash over the next 3 years. And so, I think we're sort of set for how we're going to use free cash flow and leverage for that timeframe. Having said that, we'll always reevaluate, and we do reevaluate our capital structure from time to time. We are a business that, if you look out in the future, should generate substantial free cash flow and should continue to be able to distribute substantial cash to our shareholders over a long period of time. We've also spoken that we would be -- have interest in acquisitions in our core space, and there are acquisitions out there. By and large, they're relatively small, and by and large, we will do them if they make sense to us from a return on investment basis to help accrete returns, so it's if there are very good financial attractions. They're not things that we would consider to be strategic, okay, so to speak. And there's a couple of larger relative to the physical business that are rumored hanging around out there, and we don't know if they're out there or not, and we would have to see what our appetite would be for pieces or parts or all or none of still some kind of things. But net-net, none of those, nothing we would think about will get in the way of our commitment to distribute the $2.2 billion nor should it get in the way of our ability to distribute significant cash flow beyond the 3-year time period.
Brian McKeon: Then, Kevin, let me -- I just have a couple of comments on. First, answer your question, it's a 70:30 split, 70% storage. And I think at the beginning of the question, you asked about fixed and variable interest. We're a bit higher than our ideal range. I think over time, in terms of fix floating, we've got a very annuity-based business that aligns well with the fixed commitment structure on debt, but I think over time we probably will be looking to have our fixed component more in the 70% to 80% range, but I think we're comfortable what we are currently, and that's an opportunity for us over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: You did start talking about core service, and we're back to flat, and I definitely heard the fuel's charge is helpful here. Could you just go over the trajectory for core service, and is this something that it's pickup and delivery we can't really influence, or is this something that we can influence?
Brian McKeon: Andrew, it really was more similar than different. Fuel gave us about a point in growth on the -- actually 2 points of growth on the core service line in the quarter, it was 1.5. So if you adjust for that, it really was very similar to the numbers we had in Q1, so I wouldn't point to this as a change...
C. Reese: And Andrew, by nature, the we separate our services for communication purposes between core and complementary is the things that we put in the core are services that we cannot influence. These are specifically demand-driven by customers' activity. You can't make them retrieve a file or box or tape or call us to shred a bin or so forth. That's totally related to their activity. The kinds of revenues we put in the complementary services category are the kinds of things we can go out and stimulate the sale process and so forth. And that is in fact why we define them that way.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: But Richard, I've heard you say new boxes are more active, and so as you're able to ramp up, new boxes, they should influence core.
C. Reese: I think that's true. But remember, the denominator is so big, and there's always a time lag thing kind of thing, we haven't seen it yet. I fully expect, to be clear, that the core service softness trend we see will change. And I expect there are 2 or 3 things going on in it, and they'll change, and I expected it'll at least flatten and maybe rise a little bit off of a so-called new normal in a certain position. We just haven't found it yet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of Barclays Capital.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: I guess, just first, what were the tax consequences of the Digital sales? Is there a big tax hit, or is most of that proceeds flowing through?
Brian McKeon: Yes. No, we did have a tax impact. I think the cash tax payment was over $50 million, and that's reflected in the discontinued operations.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: Okay, and then with the International, I think I heard you say volumes were up 6%, but the internal growth was up 4%. Is that, that part of the volumes were from the small M&A activity, or is it more just that the service areas were weaker than the core storage?
Brian McKeon: I'm trying to follow your question. The difference between the 6% to 4%, or are you trying to get color on the 4%?
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: No. Difference the 6% and the 4%.
Brian McKeon: We did have some acquisitions. We had Poland in there, and some [ph] acquisition in Greece as well. So it was acquisitions, and the overall numbers, they were solid. We had a 5% storage internal growth. The service number was down a bit. We were lapping the high project revenues in Europe, specifically in Italy last year, and that was constraining the number a bit.
C. Reese: We had a major project in Italy that wound down. That's the kind of revenue that will show in our comp services stuff, which, as you know, can be pretty lumpy at times.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: And then just the last question, I guess, any commentary on why you didn't repurchase stock? Was it just sort of when you were -- when you either had...
Brian McKeon: We entered into this prepaid variable repurchase program, and the way that works is we do an upfront payment commitment with banking partners, but it doesn't get -- until it gets completed, it takes 2 to 3 months to complete the program, the shares don't get delivered. So effectively, we did repurchase $250 million, and it will be done in the coming days.
C. Reese: We just haven't gotten the final accounting and delivered the shares. Therefore, we don't reflect it through our numbers.
Brian McKeon: Right. So it doesn't show up in Q2. But that was what the 7 million to 8 million share reference was, that's effectively what was repurchased in the quarter.
C. Reese: And if we enter into such a transaction, which we did, we are otherwise not trading in the market around it.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: Yes, okay. But some of the volume in the quarter was them buying the stock on your behalf. You just haven't shown that in your numbers yet?
Brian McKeon: Yes, that's correct.
C. Reese: And by the way, it's a little bit of a black-box process. They don't really tell us what's going on. You don't really know till the end. So we're making estimates.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann of Baird.
Andrew Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Just to, I guess, jump on that last question a little bit more, still there's, I'd say, kind of a fair ways to go until getting to the $1.2 billion first hurdle here. You guys are saying you're generally on track, but it looks like things are going to need to accelerate. Can you just talk about, I guess, your plan from here? And would you consider another one of these accelerated share repurchases again? Or are you able to tack on another one of those again after this first $250 million is done?
C. Reese: We're not able to do anything until it's done. And we have considerations on what we've got to do next, and shortly, we'll be discussing that with our committee and our Board as to the next step. And there's other backup plans in place and so forth. It's a fairly complex process you have to go through. As you recognize, we can't do anything until we get on open window of clear sky, blue sky insider knowledge perspective whether we can put a program in place or not. So I don't think we can comment on exactly which tools we will use, except to say that it's our expectation to continue and stay in the market on a fairly regular basis. And your comment that we might be behind, we don't see it that way. When we map it out, I'd say we're right pretty much on plan and trying to do this on a fairly consistent, steady basis.
Brian McKeon: Out of the $1.2 billion, you've got about $200 million covered by the dividend and the variable program, and the first step was $250 million...
C. Reese: So we got $750 million to go.
Brian McKeon: And we feel we're on good track.
C. Reese: And recognize, I know this is obvious, but I have to -- I want to continue to repeat it, is the $1.2 billion is an artificial date that we agreed to, and we will commit to doing it. But we've also agreed and committed to another $1 billion to find it. So we're not trying to push to a first year date and then wrap it up and walk on. This has got to be a continuing way of life for us. I just threw this 3-year period because we said earlier, we expect to have significant free cash flow in the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, tenth, and twentieth year. And in all scenarios, we can see a substantial amount of cash flow excess of the business needs. In other words, we're not starving the business. We want to make sure the business is well taken care of, but in excess of the business need, we will be returning cash to shareholders. And therefore, when you've got that significant amount of capital, we're trying to do this in a pretty programmatic basis, trying to make sure we don't make any big mistakes. But you know, we're not just trading in and out and so forth. So you'd expect to see a lot of steady distribution here.
Andrew Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: And just then just on the view of International disposition potential, you kind of mentioned, Richard, that the process of evaluating what might go and what might stay is done. Can you give us maybe a bit more insight, not specific markets, obviously, but maybe in terms of maybe a range of total capital proceeds that you might expect to see with which you've identified so far?
C. Reese: Well, the process -- I wouldn't want to say we made final decisions. I guess what I'm saying is I've seen enough analysis. They have a pretty much gut for what's going to happen, how's that? And in fact, we're going to review a lot of that with our board coming up, so we've got some final work to do. But the short answer to your basic question was, is this going to be a significant series of capital-raising events? The answer is no. There's more opportunity in our portfolio to focus the strategies and drive improvement, and we're going to, by and large, continue doing that.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I just want to ask, it's been about 3 months since you laid out the targets as to what I think you'll do over the next 3 years. I was wondering from an operational perspective, internationally, do you guys feel better about the opportunity to increase the profitability of that business, or do you feel the same or do you feel worse? In other words, after 3 months of review, where do you stand in terms of the confidence of being able to do that plan?
Brian McKeon: We feel very good about it. As we noted in the quarter, the International profit improvement was a key driver of our results. We had margins up year-on-year 110 basis points. We're on track for about a 200-basis-point improvement this year, which is consistent with what we talked about. That doesn't reflect changes in our portfolio. So there may be opportunities that emerge from that. We've continued to advance the plans with the team, we feel very good about it. The growth remains solid. The business is performing well. So I feel confident that, that's going to be a key driver of results, and we're on track for our plan. I'd also highlight just overall in the company, if you take out the proxy costs, at midpoint, our margins outlook for this year, adjusted OIBDA I think is just shy of 31%. So we're moving well towards the 32%. It was one of the benchmarks we put out there as a goal by 2013, and International's going to help us to achieve our goals in International that'll put us on good track for that objective.
C. Reese: I'd like to stress that your question is, we're into it 3 months, how do we feel about it? It leads me to believe that you might be thinking about it wrong, and so let me -- from our perspective, at least. And that is, it's not like we woke up 3 months ago and fired a gun and said you guys take a big right turn. We'd actually been working with International and developing the plans of that well before we made these announcements. And in fact, they already had a head start on a lot of the work, which is why you're seeing 150 basis points coming up this quarter. These are not the kind of things where you can just do them overnight. They take a lot of prepping, and if you go back and listen and look at our numbers, you'll see us talking about investment in International prior to this. As I said, their whole business plan for this year already had the 200 basis points in it, because we'd already started them down that strategy and that path. The other thing here that is the shift in International, though, is the International had some initiatives in the projects going partially related in the hybrid business and so forth, trying to drive and build some growth platforms for the future that were not panning out as fast as we thought. And we've asked them and refocus that, and they have, and that's part of and will help contribute to this sort of stuff. And it's part of just focusing international on, again, on the core business, just like we've done in North America. Let's look less at shiny objects and look more back at our core business, because the sense we have come to understand was that we are walking past the core business just a little too fast and leaving good opportunity, good return opportunity on the table and not going after it aggressively. And I think if you go out and talk to customers, if you go out and listen to the marketplace, I think you'll hear is Iron Mountain is awake again in the core business. And that's what I want them to hear, and that's what we want to do, because there's good business out there, and it's a big battleship, takes a long time to turn. But it's turning.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And just in terms of the divestiture potential internationally, I wasn't clear as to whether you were saying that there are further potential divestitures or you're saying that New Zealand is pretty much it.
C. Reese: I won't say New Zealand is pretty much it. I won't be that definitive. What I am saying is anything would occur won't be significant, okay, in terms of financial impact.
Brian McKeon: The question was directed at is this going to be a major source of fund?
C. Reese: No, it will not.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'm looking besides source of funds in terms of just margin improvement potential.
C. Reese: No, I don't think you'll see -- I don't think the portfolio view is going to have big shifts of margin. The 700 basis points we're going after is going to be the big shift in margin. I don't know that that's all, by the way, but for the next 2.5 years, it will be the big shift. Look, and I guess, I would tell you, though, that as much as I've said we've been working a lot on this before we announced it, I guess I would stress one thing. We didn't hold back anything. We don't have a lot of money in our pocket. Not a lot of -- we've got some reasonable cushion here, don't get me wrong. We're not totally crazy. But we came forth and said, "Look, these are the things you can do." And everybody stretched and feeling stretched pretty good. Everybody's saying they think they can do it, but there's nobody got a lot of sandbag, and I don't have a big bucket of capital of earnings in our pocket that we can dump out and protect ourselves with. We'll continue looking, and there may be some other good opportunities, we'll go looking for it. But this is the plan we expect to execute and we will execute, and we'll deliver the cash, and we'll still have a good business at the end and continue delivering cash after that. That's what we want to do, and I think we're pretty comparable we can do that.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then kind of a housekeeping. In terms of the share count for next quarter, should we assume the 7 million to 8 million goes out over the 2 months of the quarter? Is that a fair way to do it for weighted average?
Brian McKeon: Yes, well, we're expecting it to conclude in early August. So, that's midpoint, I guess, for the quarter.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, and then in terms of the talk about strategically trying to monetize the real estate assets. I understand there's a special committee out there. I just want to know if there have been -- I'm obviously not looking for definitive answers on anything, but are there a lot more ideas beyond just the reconversion that have been coming up?
C. Reese: Yes. There is a variety of ideas and structures. They fall into -- they tend to fall in some very unique categories, which I won't go through with you, okay? But we're in a stage of value generation. I mean, we're actually running a formal process. We've had lots of meetings, interviewing lots of advisers. We started to choose advisers to help us. We are going to spend some serious money on this, which is why we're going to tell you about it each quarter for a couple, few quarters till it's done, because it is a onetime kind of event. But yes, there are some ideas, and they have -- as I predicted earlier, they all come with a range of benefit and range of complexity and a range of risk. But it tends to work out those with the highest risk -- generally those with the highest risk generally have the highest complexity and generally have the highest benefit, okay, as you might expect. But yes, there's a range of stuff that we're looking at. And we will narrow that down. We're going through a process of narrowing it down and then focus on a best view, if I might say. And I don't know how many will be in the best view category, and really try to drive them to the ground and see if they makes any sense. Unfortunately -- you can make a decision on some of them fairly quickly that don't make sense or that won't work or anything else. But some of them, the devil is absolutely in the details, and there's an enormous amount of assumptions and modeling and people to talk to and so forth, and we're going through that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: A couple -- I'll try and be quick. The first one, just following up on the outsource share repurchase program. Do you guys intend, once that's completed in early August, to press release and mention your intention for what comes next? Or do we wait until the third quarter call there?
Brian McKeon: To a degree, it depends on what we decide to do. I would say that there's a few different tools here, and some things may result in a public announcement, but look, if we're doing things like open market purchases or 10b5-1 programs or things like that, our practice is not to comment on that. So I think what you should take away is that we've got a -- we are executing against the payout plan. We're making good track, and we're committed to delivering against it, and you should expect us -- the share repurchases, we said all along, is our preferred tool, and we'll continue to evaluate that. But we may or may not do a press announcement.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: And then 2 more, and I'll ask them both up front. In core storage, could you just comment on pricing, just the competitive environment you're seeing there and how that's evolving? I think you mentioned North America plus 2% year-over-year. Just thoughts there. And then the second question is, with regard to core services, I think you mentioned you have 2 or 3 things going on there. I'm particularly interested in destructions, I think you said, have stabilized. But if we can just go a level deeper on both of those topics.
Brian McKeon: Pricing, similar, plus 2%. As we mentioned, North America Records Management, that's where we've been. That's pretty much what we've got in our planned numbers as well, and so feel good about that. When you mentioned that churn has stabilized, that the combination of destructions, permanent withdrawals and terminations. Destructions are in a similar range. That will bounce up and down. It's driven by customer events. But it's been more in a stable range, similar range in recent quarters. We have seen some improvement on permanent withdrawals and terminations, reflecting we've got a real focus on customer service, and...
C. Reese: And that improvement, by the way, is a reduction in the rate of terminations and withdrawals, which the positive is, is your storage balances are higher. The negative is you don't recognize the service revenue in a fairly good service line.
Brian McKeon: It's about 7% globally, not all that different by region, to be honest with you. And it seemed to be in a similar range. So it's stable. I wouldn't be signaling improvement.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: And one more quick one, if I can sneak it in. The $6 million revenue impact from the complex repricing, is that -- any more color there? And is that something that we may see occur again, or is that really a onetime thing?
Brian McKeon: No, that absolutely should be a onetime thing.
C. Reese: So thank you very much. We appreciate your joining us this morning. As I said in the beginning, this was a good quarter. I do want to clarify a statement I made earlier, for those who haven't figured out, I don't really have too much of a script here. I'm pretty free-form, so I'd sometimes trip up in my words. As I was talking about the foundational dividend, and I made the statement that not necessarily grow with free cash flow, I don't want to imply that we're not intending to grow the dividend. We absolutely -- it is our intent. But you can expect that it's our intent that as our business continues to do well, our dividends will continue to rise. So I just want to make sure that nobody read that as a change in intent and change in the outlook and so forth. But other than that, as I said, it's a good quarter, and we hope and believe the rest of the year will show similar kinds of result as we go forward. Our business has stabilized, and we're now looking forward as we focus on the core to really making this thing hum, and I think we'll be able to do that. So again, thank you very much. I hope you enjoy the rest of your summer.
Operator: Thank you, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Bonnie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain First Quarter 2011 Earnings Call Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Golden, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Golden: Thank you. Welcome, everyone, to our 2011 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me this morning are Richard Reese, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian McKeon, our CFO. After their prepared remarks, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for our 2011 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, we also use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. With that, I'd like to introduce Richard Reese.
C. Reese: Thank you, Stephen. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our First Quarter 2011 Quarterly Earnings Call. As you know, I haven't done these calls in a few years so this is my first one back, and I'm happy to tell you that we've got good performance to report, even though I didn't have a heck of a lot to do with it since I've only been back in the job for a couple of weeks. But the team's done a great job, the business is running well. And we're off to a good start to hit the plan that we put forth in great detail last week, the 3-year strategic plan, as we've shifted our business into the third phase of our long-held 3-phase strategy, that of the phase of capitalizing on the hard work we did in the earlier years and the investment cycle of the business, building it up. We're now turning to reap the rewards of that on behalf of our shareholders and the rest of our stakeholders of the company. So today, I'll talk briefly about the results for the quarter, and then turn it over to Brian, who will give you great detail, and then we'll come back and take your questions. And I'm going to review the quarter, frankly, a bit in the context of the plan. So it was a good first quarter; we're off to a good start and it gives us confidence that we'll be able to achieve our goals for the entire fiscal year.  Revenue was up 3% to $799 million, and that was on the back of strong storage revenue growth of 5% reported and really 3% internal for us, which is an uptick. We're seeing a continued trend of steady improvements on units for storage, supported by lower destruction activities and strong new sales, particularly in North America, as the investments we've been making according to our plan are paying off. We also have seen some continued weakness in some of our recurring service lines and, of course, when destructions are down, the good news is it helps storage over the long run. The bad news is it's a little light on the services in the short term, but it's a trade we would take all the time. So in general, I think as a company, we're feeling better about some of the trends and starting to see some of the changes from the economy, but I want to be very, very careful to caution you, this is a business that moves very slowly. That's its strength and its weakness. And I would caution anybody from taking these positive signs and trying to forecast up. What we're telling you is we think we're going to be in line with our expectations for the year, and we have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to do that. So with that, well, let me pull it back. Let me just take you on down a little bit. The other reported numbers, the adjusted OIBDA is up 4% on an operating basis, really a little less on a reporting basis, because that way, it excludes certain one-time expenses that Brian will go through for you in detail. And adjusted EPS is up 24%. So as I said, a good start for the quarter. We have a pretty good confidence, or even better than pretty good confidence, for the fiscal year, assuming banks continue in line, and we'll get through the details as we go. If we look over at some of the pieces and, as we said, last week, we put forth a 3-year plan. The key elements of it was an acceleration into the third phase of the capitalization phase of our business. And it had a variety of components. But by and large, we've made some -- put a stake in the ground on a couple of issues: One is to increase our after-tax return invested capital by about 330 basis points, up to 11% by 2013. And two is just to return to our shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and/or dividends $2.2 billion of cash with $1.2 billion of that coming in the next 12 months. These commitments haven't changed. You'll hear us continue to talk about them over the next couple of years as we deliver on them, or to guess them [ph] as we deliver on them. If we take the business, as far as North America, it’s following the strategy. It is the market leader. I've spoken of it many times. It is the goose that laid the golden egg. And so our strategy is to make sure we take care of the goose and invest in her correctly, so she can continue to lay the golden eggs. And that was a combination of maintaining and sustaining margins, while at the same time, investing some in sales and marketing to increase the growth rate, or at least to keep the growth rate on the trajectory and overcome any secular trends that may be out there. And first quarter reflected these trends very well. Our storage internal growth was 3%. That's up from a 2% number of last year. Our contribution to our new sales in our Records Management business, North America, from our sales force, the so-called new from new, is almost double what it was the first quarter of last year. So the investments we've started making towards the end of last year in the change in focus is paying off, and we would expect it will continue to pay off. Again, I'll caution you that it takes a while for all these to flow through our reported numbers on an annuity-based business. But we like the trends we're seeing, and we would continue working those trends. On the International front, the strategy is to continue the growth that we've seen because that portfolio has driven good growth, while at the same time, look to improve the operational side of the portfolio as well as returns on invested capital. And the growth did continue on a reported basis. International revenues up 10%, driven by 6% storage internal growth rate. The other big news is that the plan calls for 700 basis points of margin increase over 3 years. We're looking at International to get nearly 200 basis points of margin this year. You didn't see any of it in the first quarter. We expect strong margin growth in the U.K. We're making -- and that's coming off the back of investments that we started some last year. So we expect them to flow through this year. But we got some lapping effects and some comparables that we need to get out of the way. But as we get into the year, we fully expect to see the margins flow through there. We're making some investments in Latin America now, which will yield some benefit towards the end of this year and into next year. So we haven't started showing the margin improvement yet in International, but we feel very good about what we're seeing and the investments we're making and so forth, the payback we're seeing. But the numbers, it will take a couple of quarters from the flow through for you to see them. But from what we can see, things are going fine. On our Digital business, as you know, we announced that we are evaluating strategic alternatives, and we're deep into that process. We've got nothing new to report today, but except to tell you that additional business had good performance in the first quarter. And I appreciate the team really focusing on the business, not just maintaining it, but continuing to grow it. Revenues were up solidly in all of our products and areas, except for eDiscovery. And eDiscovery had a great quarter of bookings. But in that business, the bookings lead the revenue by a couple or 3 quarters. So we're showing weaker revenues off of bookings about 3 quarters ago, and it will take some time period for the stronger bookings to show through in our numbers now. But we like the trends we see in the business and we like the performance. We've been able to right size our cost structures so our profits are up in the business. And as I say, we're maintaining good performance in the business even as we look at strategic alternatives. And I think the team's done a great job in doing that. The other big news that we announced in our plan, as I said earlier, was our commitment to return $2.2 billion to our shareholders in various forms of payout. This would come primarily from our operating cash flow and the future free cash flow, but it does and had included a small change in our leverage, taking our leverage ratio, total leverage up from around 3.0x to around 3.5x, which is a relatively small move. And I will make sure that everybody understands that we're not going out and over levering the business. We're doing what we think is prudent and what we think makes some sense, and the company still has substantial liquidity and substantial capital available to it to execute its plans. We have nothing new to report on how we plan to pay that out, except that since we've spoken publicly about it last week, we've gotten a lot of input from shareholders, which we do appreciate and we will try to factor that input in. And as you might can imagine, it's a little bit of some people would love us to turn left and others would love us to turn right, all at the same time. And we will try to figure out how to walk down both sides of that train track and make it work. But by and large, we'll take your input, but we will do what we believe makes the most sense and try to explain it to you, and if you disagree, we'd be happy to listen to that, too. This is -- I want to stress to you the fact that we're putting out $2.2 billion in a fairly short period of time is a shift and is a change, but it's not the end. And I think one of the things we -- and I want to help the market over time come to grips with, this is the beginning of a pattern, not the end of a pattern. This business will throw off a significant amount of cash back to shareholders for as far out as I can see. And in fact, failure to do so would delever the business to zero and in not too long a time period. And just to even maintain a prudent leverage level, which is prudent in our capital structure, to maintain a good weighted average cost of capital for our business and so forth, we will have to distribute a significant amount of capital, in addition to making the right investments back into the business to continue the ability to do that for a long period of time.  So we are in a point of the business that I've been waiting on for a long time. And I guess, to some extent, although the retirement was looking awfully attractive, being back at this stage of the business also has its fun because figuring out exactly how to do this stuff is pretty interesting and pretty challenging. And I think we're going to have a good time trying to figure out how to give you cash back. So with that, as I said, good quarter. We're off to a good start. I hope they're all this easy from a call perspective. And I appreciate the team making my first entry back in fairly easy for me. Let me turn it over to Brian, and then we'll come back for your questions.
Brian McKeon: Thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone. I'll start today's review on Slide 3, which highlights key messages. First key message is that we delivered solid operating performance in Q1, and it's putting us on track for our full-year goals. We saw solid storage trends, including benefits from new sales initiatives that supported 3% revenue growth in the quarter. Overall storage revenues increased 5% or 3% on an internal growth basis. The International business again posted strong storage results, and both our North American and Digital segments showed improvement. Revenue growth's benefiting from sales and marketing investments, as Richard mentioned. In fact, in Q1, storage volume additions from new sales in North America was the highest it's been in more than 2 years. Profit and cash flow gains remained solid as well, supported by improvements in our International and Digital segments. Adjusted OIBDA was $222 million, that's up 4% on an operating basis, excluding $4 million of advisory fees and other costs that were related to the recent proxy contest. Adjusted EPS was $0.26, which is an increase of 24% compared to last year, and free cash flow increased 7% in the quarter to $58 million. We're off to a good start, and we're making some positive adjustments to our full-year operating forecast to incorporate positive FX changes in our Q1 performance. Given the recent announcement of our comprehensive strategic plan, including the potential sale of the majority of our Digital assets, we'll be taking the following approach with respect to our full-year 2011 outlook. We're going to forecast the business as it exists today, therefore, our current outlook doesn't reflect any impacts from the strategic review of our Digital business, including a potential sale as contemplated in the strategic plan. Our current outlook also doesn't include any impacts from business or revenue risk, transition costs or other costs associated with the ongoing strategic alternative review process. Finally, our outlook doesn't include any costs or increased interest expense associated with potential future financing events that may be contemplated in the strategic plan. We'll update our outlook when we have more clarity around strategic alternatives for our Digital business or potential financing transactions. Within this framework, we're raising our revenue guidance. We're also adjusting our adjusted -- updating our adjusted OIBDA outlook to reflect these revenue gains, as well as the estimated advisory fees and other costs associated with the recent proxy contest. And I'll speak to these more fully in the outlook section of my remarks. Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin with the review of the financial results. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the first quarter of 2010. As noted, Q1 was a solid start to the year. Enterprise revenue growth was 3%, up from Q4, reflecting improved storage revenue growth and benefits from favorable FX and recent acquisitions. Enterprise revenue gains were supported by improved storage revenue internal growth of 3% and expansion of hybrid services. And these gains have offset continued softness in core service activities and lower eDiscovery revenues. From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 1% internal growth, supported by 2% storage internal growth, hybrid service gains and benefits from higher recycled paper prices. These gains were partially offset by continued soft core service revenues, in part reflecting lower levels of destructions and reduced special project revenue in the quarter. Revenues for our International Physical segment grew 10%, supported by 4% internal growth, benefits from our recently announced Polish acquisition and favorable foreign exchange rate changes. Storage internal growth rate for International remained strong at 6%, reflecting gains across all regions, including continued strong growth in expansion markets. These gains were augmented by strong growth in hybrid service revenues. Total service revenue growth was constrained by lower core service activity levels. In our Digital segment, reported revenues declined 5% in the first quarter, primarily reflecting lower eDiscovery revenues, which more than offset storage gains. Overall, we continue to post solid comparable profit gains. Gross profits grew 4% in Q1, reflecting a 40 basis point improvement in margins. Higher storage gross margins, particularly in the International and Worldwide Digital segments, drove the improvement. These gains more than offset lower service gross margins resulting from eDiscovery profit declines and moderately higher transportation costs in North America. Adjusted OIBDA grew to $222 million, up 2%, or up 4%, excluding the $4 million and one-time fees associated with the proxy contest. Solid gross profit gains were partially offset by planned investments in North American sales initiatives and productivity initiatives in the International segment, which we expect to yield substantial benefits as we move forward. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $79 million and amortization was $10 million. Other Income for the quarter was $9 million, including $3 million of FX gains and a $5 million gain on our Polish transaction. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.26 per share, an increase of 24% compared to the prior year, reflecting solid operating performance, lower interest expense, lower structural tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.37 per share, including the $0.12 per share impact of the $9 million of Other Income and a lower effective tax rate. The structural tax rate for the quarter was 38%, and we expect the structural tax rate for the full year to be about 39%. Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures in foreign exchange compared to our 2011 full-year outlook. As noted, overall revenue growth in Q1 was 3% on track with our full-year growth outlook. Improved storage gains of 3% offset service declines, netting to 1% internal growth in the quarter. The storage revenue growth rate reflects continued strong performance in the International segment and improvement in sales in North America. Net global records management volume growth increased about 2% year-on-year in Q1. We'll breakdown key drivers of this change as part of today's review. Pricing trends remained consistent with net pricing gains of about 2% in North America records management. Core service revenues were down 1% in the quarter, reflecting continued soft core activity levels, in part driven by lower destruction activity. We continue to experience service activity declines in areas like retrievals and refiles and in tape backup activity, as customers have moved to a less frequent tape rotation cycle. Complementary service revenues, which represent about 13% of total revenues, decreased 5% internally in the quarter. Results reflected lower eDiscovery reported revenues and lower special project revenues, in part impacted by the lapping of a large project in the U.S. These decreases offset strong gains in hybrid service revenues and benefits from higher recycled paper pricing. Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review global volume growth trends. Slide 6 shows key drivers of global records management volume for the last 3-plus years to give you a sense of recent volume growth dynamics. This chart shows annualized changes in quarterly records management volume as a percentage of the beginning cubic feet related to new sales, volume growth from existing customers, offset by outgoing volume return. Revenues associated with physical records management storage drive about 40% of overall enterprise revenues, so trends on this front are meaningful. Overall, global records management volumes have stabilized following impacts from the economic contraction and are starting to show some signs of improvement. There are a few key takeaways from this trend analysis. First, the economy had a meaningful impact on records management volume trends in our business in 2009 and 2010. We experienced a significant increase in destructions related to cost savings initiatives, as well as a lagging impact from longer sales cycles and reduced incoming volume due to high unemployment rates. Within these results are also ongoing secular impacts, as new volume from existing customers continues to moderate slowly. Our focus has been on improving new sales performance in North America, supported by targeted investment, and in expanding our business in faster growing regions internationally. We're seeing positive momentum on these fronts. North America new sales contributions has been rising steadily in recent quarters with Q1 volume additions from new sales at its highest level since 2008. It takes time for new sales benefits to flow through our annuity, but we're on good track with our go-to-market initiatives. This progress is consistent with our long-term plan goals for North America, specifically to increase sales, to offset secular impacts and sustain the North American annuity. International growth is continuing at a solid pace with volume up 6% year-on-year in the quarter. We saw year-on-year volume gains across all regions, supported by strong growth in expansion markets like Central Europe and Latin America. Storage progress is also being supported by some moderations in destructions and churn globally. We expect quarterly fluctuations on this front, driven by episodic customer actions. But overall, these impacts have settled into a stable range. In sum, some of the negative trends we've been experiencing have stabilized, our investment focus is reaping gains, and we're growing the storage annuity consistent with our long-term strategy. Let's move now to Slide 7 and review our results on a segment basis. Slide 7 shows key metrics for each of our 4 segments compared to the first quarter of 2010. North America remains our financial engine, and we're building momentum in International as a driver of profit and cash flow gains. North America continued to drive high profits and strong cash flows in Q1. Revenues increased 1% on 2% storage revenue gains and increased hybrid service revenues. Adjusted OIBDA margins in our largest segment were sustained at 41% on gross margin gains and controlled overhead spending, which supported planned investments in sales and marketing. Capital efficiency continue to improve with CapEx as a percentage of sales decreasing to below 4%. Our International segment continues to post solid revenue, adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains. Internal growth for the quarter was 4%, driven by continuous strong storage internal growth of 6%. Adjusted OIBDA grew 10% in Q1, in line with reported revenue gains. We're targeting strong improvement in International margins in 2011, supported by profit gains in the U.K. and expansion of operational excellence initiatives in Latin America. Gains in our Physical business helped offset lower Digital revenues. Lower revenues and gross margins in our eDiscovery business constrained Digital financial gains in the quarter. These impacts were offset by cost control initiatives, which drove a 25% increase in adjusted OIBDA in the segment in Q1. The increase in corporate expenses primarily reflects one-time costs associated with the proxy contest. Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our debt portfolio. Our balance sheet remains strong, reflecting the substantial improvements we've driven in cash generation in recent years. Currently, our consolidated leverage ratio is 3x at the low-end of our targeted 3 to 4x leverage range. We're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was approximately $760 million with $190 million in cash and $571 million in additional borrowing capacity under our revolver. During the first quarter, we repurchased 384,000 shares of stock at a total cost of $11 million. At the end of the quarter, as of March 31, 2011, we've repurchased 5.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately $122 million. At quarter end, there was approximately $228 million remaining under the existing share repurchase authorization. Our debt portfolio was long and fixed, our weighted average interest rate was 6.6% and we were 80% fixed at quarter end. Maturity is just under 7 years with no bond repayments due until 2014. In January, we used excess cash in borrowings on our revolver to redeem the remaining $231 million of our 7 3/4% senior subordinated notes due in 2015. This transaction will reduce our net interest expense by approximately $17 million in 2011. Looking at our maturity schedule, we have approximately $192 million borrowed under our revolver, which matures next April. We expect to refinance our senior credit facility in 2011. The strength of our balance sheet reinforces our confidence in advancing the shareholder payout commitments outlined in our strategic plan.  Let's now turn to Slide 9 to discuss our 2011 full-year outlook. Slide 9 highlights our approach to our full-year outlook in 2011. As I mentioned earlier, we're forecasting the business as it exists today. At this point, we don't have enough clarity around the final outcome of the Digital process or financing options to provide a forecast of those events. Our current outlook also doesn't include any business or revenue risks, transition costs or other costs we may incur as we work our way through the strategic review process for Digital. We expect to have greater clarity in both of these areas during the coming quarters, and we'll update you on our progress when appropriate. What is included in our current outlook is approximately $15 million of advisory fees and other costs related to our recent proxy contest. These costs include legal and professional advisory fees, severance costs, estimated costs for the upcoming REIT analysis and other related expenses. Let's turn to Slide 10 for a look at our outlook for 2011. Slide 10 summarizes our full-year 2011 financial guidance. We've increased our enterprise revenue outlook by about $45 million to be in the range of $3,220,000,000 to $3,285,000,000, up 3% to 5%. This reflects our solid Q1 performance and the impacts of favorable foreign currency rate changes. We now expect CapEx to add about 2% to this year's revenue growth rate. We're now targeting adjusted OIBDA of $938 million to $966 million. This includes the $15 million of estimated costs associated with the recent proxy contest, which more than offset the flow-through benefits from our outlook for increased revenues. This range represents reported growth of minus 1% plus 2%, including previously announced incremental sales and marketing investments. Excluding the $15 million of advisory and one-time fees, adjusted OIBDA growth would be in the 1% to 4% range. Please note that we will face some tougher adjusted OIBDA comparisons over the next 3 quarters related to low incentive compensation accruals in 2010. In Q2, this will result in a $9 million increase in reported costs. We also expect to about $6 million in fees and other costs related to the proxy contest to be reported in Q2. Our current outlook is for adjusted EPS -- our full-year outlook is for adjusted EPS to grow between 1% and 8% to a range of $1.16 to $1.24 per share, reflecting the adjustments described above and refinements to our outlook for DNA and interest expense, including impacts from recent FX changes. DNA is now expected to be approximately $352 million. Interest is expected to be $204 million. Our full-year forecast assumes 201 million shares outstanding. This reflects the level of shares outstanding at the end of Q1, including increases to diluted impacts from recent increases in our stock price. We're keeping our full-year free cash flow outlook at $375 million to $410 million and updating our outlook for capital expenditures, which are now expected to be $235 million for the year. This capital outlook includes about $15 million for real estate. Finally, as noted on the slide, our current full-year outlook includes approximately $190 million of revenues, $20 million to $25 million of adjusted OIBDA and about $15 million of capital expenditures related to the Digital service lines currently included in our strategic alternative review process.  In summary, Q1 was a solid start to the year, and we're on track towards our full-year goals for improving revenue growth and continued strong profit and cash flow performance. Thanks, and we'll now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Internal growth guidance for the 2011 is unchanged even though you're up in your revenue guidance? Or why don't you comment on it? Is it zero to two?
Brian McKeon: It's still zero, two, Andrew. We're feeling good about the storage outlook, and the core services continues to be soft so they're offsetting somewhat. But I think on balance, we're feeling good about the trends, but I think some of the softness in core service activity is leading us to a similar range.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And I think I heard Richard say that they're kind of part and partial. As we're getting better on revenues on storage, it's because destructions are stabilizing and that's going to hurt service. And so it's almost -- the two are almost related.
C. Reese: There's some of that dynamic, and that's a good news dynamic over the long run. There's also weaknesses in other services and to start our general retrieval refile activity and same thing in the data protection activity. We're still seeing activity lower even though we're seeing storage pick up some.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Makes sense. And last point, just to make sure we get this right, it sounds like you're still committed to hybrid services even though you're looking for alternatives in Digital. Is that correct?
C. Reese: Oh, yes, absolutely. And I want to stress that we are looking to transition to a different model in Digital, not necessarily exit all of the services. In some, we might do with the same technology on a license back basis. Some, we might perform with different technologies on a license basis. But the Digital business, and this is probably a story for a later date because it's a longer story, is a good business and we've learned a lot in it. But the model we had, just didn't make sense us to maintain it, and we think those assets are more valuable to other people.
Brian McKeon: Yes, and it sounded like, too. As you know, Andrew, the hybrid services are very close into our core business. I mean, it's helping customers with their transitioning where they're working with physical records, and the business is going really well for us and we feel good about it.
C. Reese: And I think you'll see over time that we will speak less of hybrid and not of Digital, but we will talk to you about physical logistics services and we'll talk to you about technology product lines, not business units and so forth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of Barclays Capital.
Zachary Fadem - Barclays Capital: It's Zach Fadem for Gary. You say that you expected 200 basis point increase in International Physical adjusted EBITDA this year? Can you give us some additional color on the expected drivers of this gain?
Brian McKeon: Yes, big driver this year will be in the U.K. We've been working for some time with the International team of incorporating the North American playbook, and we are targeting meaningful increases in our -- we have good margins in the U.K. They're getting moved -- moving that much closer to North America levels, and we'll see those benefits flow as we work through the year. We're exporting the same playbook to other markets, too. We just have some investment that goes along with that as we kind of gear up the teams and kind of invest in the process redesign that goes along with yielding those benefits and that along with some lapping impacts kind of constrain the gains in Q1. But you'll see the benefits flowing through as we work through the year, and we feel -- our outlook is based on a strong improvement in International margins overall. And it's not just this year; that's the multiyear plan. We'll continue to drive that as we move forward.
Zachary Fadem - Barclays Capital: Okay. And regarding the expected modest increase in leverage, would you expect to stick with your recent history of largely fixed-rate debt or would you consider floating rate borrowing?
C. Reese: We will consider whatever makes sense in the market at the time. I have always had a bias for a large amount of fixed-rate debt. At this stage of our cycle, we may be over fixed, and I think it's something we will look at in a variety of ways.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Are there any metrics you can provide now regarding the number of Digital customers, the number of hybrid customers or any metrics regarding the percentage of customers subscribing to multiple services, just Physical, Digital and Shredding?
C. Reese: Well, we have the numbers. We don't have them in front of us. So it may be something we can dig up for future discussion with you. I mean, the trends are that we have more crossover selling, obviously, of between records management and our data protection services, as well as our records management, our Shredding services. And we've had good success cross selling there. And we've -- on a name-the-customer basis, we've got pretty good success across our Digital business, but it's a different buyer for sure between our Physical business and our Digital business. The other thing I would also tell you is that part of what we learn in the Digital business, though, even though it was a Digital buyer that our brand would translate, and that although not all the IT buyers -- I think they all have a perception of who Iron Mountain is and so forth. They didn't have a strong perception of how broad a product or service line we had, so we had to sell it. But having said all that, we proved we could sell it, and, in fact, more than half of the revenue we have in Digital today was internally grown revenue, not purchased revenue. So we know the market will accept these things from us, and we've got other research as well as these data points to say it.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Okay, that makes sense. And you mentioned higher transportation costs in North America. What about internationally? Are you feeling the same pressure abroad? And if so, is that having a meaningful impact at all on the margin expansion story there?
Brian McKeon: It impacts us. It's a smaller factor in terms of our overall cost structure. Transportation is less than 2% of our revenues. We do have some cushion against that with fuel surcharges. Right now, it tends to lag, how the fuel surcharges kick in based off an index. So what we've seen in Q1 is kind of the cost of, but not yet the benefit of the -- the full benefit of the surcharges flowing through. I think that will improve as we work through the year. So on balance, it should be less of an impact over economics, but it is impacting us in the short term.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Okay, that's helpful. And maybe one last question regarding the aim to buyback a more significant number of shares. I guess for now, you can at least act under the remaining $228 million from the previously authorized buyback. Is there any blackout period or other technical or legal reason that you need to wait to buyback more shares? Or is it more that you could start buying immediately if you wanted to?
C. Reese: Yes, there's a whole bunch of technical or legal reasons, open windows and so forth. We will come in to an open window of our own policy next [Audio Gap] And yes, we do have some in the buyback. We really, though, are focusing -- I mean, if we’ve got shares to authorize, we're focusing on trying to set up the right strategies and the right plans. So it's a little early for me to tell you exactly how we'll do it. As you've probably noticed, it's all kinds of tools and techniques, and we've spent a lot of time analyzing those. And we still kind of coming to decisions on what's the right way to execute it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann of Baird.
Andrew Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: I thought some of the commentary you had on the North American sales initiatives was interesting. I wanted to dig a little bit more into that. Perhaps could you just quantify what the SG&A investment was in that maybe for this year? And then I guess more broadly speaking, give us your sense of where you think the returns are on that investment? You said it was holding you back a little bit in the first quarter, but traction has been good. Is there a long ramp ahead for those presumably salespeople where they're just starting to maybe breakeven and there's a lot of upside from here? Or how would you characterize that from here?
Brian McKeon: We'll try to take the first part of the question and maybe if Richard can help clarify how we're thinking about it. But the investment we highlighted this year is roughly $20 million in terms of sales and marketing and year-on-year. And we were ramping that and getting that in position as we headed into this year. So that is starting to bear fruit. I think we are feeling good. We know the business well. We understand the returns, and we feel very good about the investments we'll be making. Do you want to talk about the margin?
Brian McKeon: Yes, any time you up your sales and marketing in an annuity business like this, you'll see the expense early and you see the results. It's a little bit like watching bookings build up. For our case, we watch boxes or storage revenue build, but the real value comes off the compound effect of it. So it's a multiyear present value kind of analysis, because you're building an annuity. Okay, so any time you up your cost, it takes a while for you to get the return back. But the returns are actually quite good in doing that. In terms of is there upside from here, a little early for me to tell. There's a theme here, so I'll just be clear to make sure everybody hears it. We feel good about our numbers. We feel really good -- better about the trends we have in a long time. But we're not jumping up and down and screaming, "Yeah, this things going to the roof." And by the way, it never has. Welcome to the world of our big flywheel annuity. They're hard to speed up and they're hard to slow down, but the good news is they just keep on rolling. And there's some speeding up, just a little bit. It's rolling, but it takes a while for this to show. So there's no inflection points here. No great things are going to take off.
Andrew Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: That makes sense. And I guess I just wanted to follow up a little bit on an earlier question on the service level. How much of maybe the slower levels of growth that we're seeing are just based on tough comps from higher destruction levels last year?
C. Reese: A piece of that, but if you take it apart by activity class, we're still seeing the weakness in, like I say, in a lot of the core activity elements.
Andrew Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: I see. And then just thoughts -- do you think this is a quarter lumpiness issue or are people really changing the way they utilize documents once they're stored?
C. Reese: I believe it's people -- I believe it's two things. I think there's a pattern of behavior change, and I still believe that until we see employment get back up strong and then a lag behind that. Remember, we tend to deal in records that are at least a year old on average, okay? And so you've got to get people back to work. They've got to generate more records. They've got to build up. They've got to get in the way, and then they've got send them to us before they can ask for them. And the most active records are the newest records. So we've been through a period of people sending us a lot less of -- the average age of our storage portfolio has risen, which will in itself drive down the activity. We're seeing that. If the average age comes down and the storage picks back up as the economy picks back up, we got this great lag effect. I think some of that will come back. They will pick up some activity. Underlying that though, there's also some shift in how people use it. It's hard to parse the difference right now.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Very helpful.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Eric Boyer of Wells Fargo.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: I was just wondering if you could comment on how customers may have reacted or are reacting to the new strategic plan and the direction you're possibly going with the Digital business.
C. Reese: Yes. So far, it's a big customer base. So I haven't had my phone ringing off the hook, screaming at me or anything like that. I posted -- we posted and sent out to customers a kind of an open letter from me to them just recently, explaining what we're doing and so forth. And I think the early reaction is, "Thank you for telling us. We appreciate being in the know." And look, what we're telling them and, in fact, in this case, we are focusing, making sure we focus heavily on our Physical business, that we don't lose sight of the services that you expect of us, and we'll continue to build that business. We're not draining it. And part of what we have to explain, and something we have to explain to the employees is, is we've got enough capital to give our shareholders $2.2 billion. I won't give you a $0.50 an hour raise. And if you don't think that's a hard discussion, you come try it a while, okay? And it's the same sort of thing with customers. You're giving your shareholders $2.2 billion, why do you want to raise my price? And you have to get back to economics and market value and cost structure -- there's a lot that you have to do, and you have to train the organization to understand. And that's the kind of stuff we're working on.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: So in that context, have you changed your strategy or thinking about changing the strategy with the pricing program?
C. Reese: No. Look, our pricing program has been and, as far as I'm around, will be designed around: a, being fair; and b, recovering the true increase of cost minus some productivity we've gained. I've always believed -- we've always -- if you go back and feel this industry [indiscernible], we've driven an enormous amount of productivity in our industry, both to the consolidation, creating more of just general economic productivity by consolidating competitors. But we've also brought technology, how you store box, we changed radically the whole technology of how you store the box, what the cost are doing that is and everything. It took a lot of time, money and investment to do it. Net of that is, we drove unit storage prices down for about 15 years straight on average to the customer base. And we've kind of run the productivity out of this business from their perspective, and now it's time to take back gains related to true increase of cost, and we'll continue doing that.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And then Brian, just on the adjusted OIBDA margin, would that be up slightly year-over-year with your new guidance if you backed out that proxy-related costs? I just want to make sure I'm thinking of that right.
Brian McKeon: It's down slightly because of the -- it's not all that different than what we had talked about heading into the year. We have this significant kind of lap $30 million plus of -- last year, we had very low incentive compensation payments and we had normal payments this year. So that is constraining us. So it's down slightly X the proxy contest cost. But it's all driven by that factor, which is really something that you basically supported last year's margins. The underlying operating performance, we're seeing improved margins.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay, great. And then Richard, just on the last call, you talked about other capital structure ideas that you may be thinking of other than a REIT. Could you give us a sense of what some of those could be?
C. Reese: A little early. I'm still collecting a list. I have my list. But since I've put it out there, phones have been ringing, ideas are coming in. So let me sort through them a little bit because some of them are interesting and some of them are harebrained, and I'm speaking to some of mine when I say that, and some might be doable, some may not be doable. But after we get a little more homework done, we'll talk to you about it.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay, fair enough.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann of William Blair Company.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Just kind of wanted to ask a little bit of a question. I know, Richard, you have a lot on your plate in terms of different directions. But one of the things over the past couple of years that you guys have done a great job at is various efficiency programs, and was wondering if -- as you're coming back to business, if you've identified any other things that you kind of wanted to tackle on that efficiency or productivity front in terms of cost reduction.
C. Reese: Look, I didn't identify it, no. The team's been working on this for some time. And I guess you put it in 3 categories. We talk about the North American playbook as if it's a simple little thing that we hand around to each other. But North America has developed over the last 3 to 4 years significant numbers of strategies and implemented them very successful and driving efficiency in the business. And if that, we're exporting, particularly to our bigger businesses in Europe and starting in the U.K., which is where we're looking to get 200 basis points this year. We're also starting a program here we call support excellence. It uses some of the same techniques that we found successful and others targeting to two things: Benchmark all of our support functions against best practices, and then try to figure out how we can get ourselves to a best practice both service level and transactional cost level. And I've stressed this to everybody, it's a combination of making sure we serve ourselves well, serve one another well, as well as a combination of doing it the lowest possible cost. And I happen to believe you can achieve both of those. Better service doesn't always mean higher cost. In fact, doing it right, doing it well usually delivers better tuned service and a lower cost. So we've undertaken those initiatives just to play it [ph] over in the next few years. And all of that is embedded in the plan we put forth last year. So I don't think I'm going to come up with any secret sauce on top of that. In fact, I would tell you, the plans, when I look at them, are awfully aggressive. And some people have asked me, do I worry about them? And the answer is yes. But my worry is that we've really put forth a pretty hard stake in the ground over a fairly short time period. I don't really worry about hitting the number. I worry about hitting the number in the timeframe that we put forth. But you take a shot, you do your best to get there. You've got a better chance of getting there if you take aggressive shots and we've taken aggressive shots.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Fair enough. And then also, there's been a lot of focus, obviously, on the underperforming businesses and services, et cetera. But certainly, the core business, showing some sign of life I think is pretty positive kind of going forward and hopefully starting an improving trend. Just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit in terms of what you're seeing there in terms of the various end market demand and what's kind of driving that and if there's any areas that really stand out to you.
C. Reese: Candidly, been here 2 weeks and most of the time, I've been talking and dealing with shareholder issues. I can't tell you I've gotten personally deep enough in to give you a really good answer on the subtleties in the trends. My time has been focused on the things you've heard about and heard me talk a lot about. Come late in the day and start on Monday, I've got a whole series of meetings with different managers of different groups of the business, where I'm going to go get my head back and calibrate my gut again. And after I've done that, I might can answer that question better.
Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Fair enough.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Just one from me. Richard, I heard your response to that last question. So more conceptually, I guess, is the way I'll ask this. Certainly we've thought about the special projects and the services area as kind of a lead, something that we've watched to see things start to come back. Have you had any conversations with your people out on the street as to what they're seeing and hearing; is that picking up? And then the second part of the question is, do you believe that's the way you'll see the recovery of the business?
C. Reese: No. I think we'll see the recovery of the business exactly where I think but do not absolutely know. We are at the brink of, and that is that storage leads, everything else follows. Think about what I said earlier: Newest boxes create the most activity, okay? So you've got to have -- you've got to build up your newest boxes if you want to have the activity come back. With the activity comes transportation; the more you pick, the more you move. All those things lead and come in that direction. In terms of special projects, a lot of the special projects are designed around either events, as in people get sued or they have big internal audits and so forth, or they're driven around other events as in M&A. A reasonable amount of our special project work moves with M&A as customers takes 2 businesses, put them together. They have to clean out the records of the -- and sometimes even have to split the records of buyers or sellers or selling a division or this, that and the other. So their kind of event or any. We don't control those events and so forth. And then they have a third element, which is, "I've got budget money and I want to improve my program," or "I've been dying to do something to clean up a past mess, and I've got to have budget money to do that." And in lean years, that budget money just doesn't show up at our customers. In years, things get better in our customers, they'll reinvest back in their programs. And oftentimes, you'll see that late in the year, by the way, for obvious reasons. So Q1 is not usually a good special project. So that's sort of the trend. That's sort of the buying pattern, and I think we'll see it, but we'll see it a little later in the cycle. The other things we see is our eDiscovery business is, as we said, is off. And that flows through our comp services and sort of projects side of our business. But the bookings are back up. And I think that is as much as a factor of us losing focus on it in our Digital business 9 months ago as it is anything and really getting focused back on it and doing a really good job, which, if we were to own it, 9 months from now or 6 months from now, we'd see the revenue flow through well there. So I think that -- and then the last I'd say is our DMS part of our hybrid business is solid and growing really well, which flows through some of that too. You get some puts and takes across the board now in a lot of those categories. And by the way, the DMS business, the reason it's growing well, it is primarily driven to help customers on the productivity side. It's customers looking to use the information in different ways to create more productivity, and that's really the trend we sell into there.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: What percentage of the business is hybrid now? And just more conceptually, do you think some of those services are sapping some of the revenue from the traditional services side of the business, or is it -- they don't cannibalize each other?
C. Reese: Yes. It's about 5%. And in terms of cannibalization, there's two ways to answer that. In terms of cannibalizing storage, no, not in any significant manner. And in fact, I can make the argument that you'll actually get more hard copies storage by doing more of this. And part of the simple argument is every time you go to look at a small vendor in that space, they'll all have a net warehouse full of boxes that they just seem to accumulate, okay? Because customers digitized things for good reason, but for productivity, for process reasons. But for archival reasons, digitizing is a bad idea because the cost of transporting that data multiple times over 15 years costs way more than just keeping the box for 15 years, and that's what they tend to do. So it's not a cannibalization issue. From our perspective, early on, as we got the business going a couple of years ago, it cannibalized our box storage business because we really waved the shiny object of a new service in front of our sales force and made it too easy for them to sell that new service and make their targets and make their compensation, and they didn't have to work as hard on selling for box storage. And to some extent, we did that to ourselves and we have clearly recovered from doing that. And we've clearly gotten better at balancing how we sell so we can sell them both. And that's the results you're seeing there. But we went through the learning curve of that; it was painful.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Super. And then just, obviously, with the way fuel's gone, it seems like you'll benefit from the surcharges. We start to see that on the service line, if I remember, on the service line, if I remember that. Is that right?
Brian McKeon: Yes, you'll see that. You'll see some benefit points around the core service revenues, Kevin. I just wanted to highlight it, it won't have an impact on profit, right? It will be offsetting higher fuel costs.
C. Reese: And Kevin, we're seeing the costs on that. We'll see the revenue later. But there will also be the costs there later, too.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Super. And just a last question, Brian, you tweaked the CapEx a little bit, or Richard?
Brian McKeon: Well, about $5 million of that was just an updated real estate estimate and $5 million was just obviously refining just how we're looking at the year. So combined, that was the adjustment.
C. Reese: So it looks like we've hit the end of hour. I appreciate you all coming and your questions today. As I said in the beginning, we've got a great business. It is performing well. That's a great welcome back for me. I'm glad I didn't have to come and explain a tough quarter the first time out. As I told somebody who asked me how I like being back, and I said, "Well, I'm still on a honeymoon period right now, but it won't last forever. But I'll enjoy it while I can." So I appreciate all your support and your cards and letters and your input. It is useful to us. It's helpful to us. We do listen to it, and we try to factor it into our thinking as we have to make trade-offs and decisions as we go forward. I'll also -- I don't know exactly what the schedule is, but we will be out on the road some, in cities near you over the next 6 to 9 months, and I'd love to get a chance to get reacquainted for some I haven't seen in a while and those that I really don't know, I'd also like the chance to talk to you. And the last invitation is you're always welcome to come see us in Boston. So just give us a call. We'll try to find a date and time that works. Again, thank you very much, and I'll look forward to seeing you down the road. Goodbye.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Bonnie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Call webcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Golden, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Golden: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our 2010 fourth quarter earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are our CFO, Brian McKeon, who will review our financial results; followed by Bob Brennan, CEO, remarks. When Bob is finished with his comments, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Per our custom, we have a user controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com.  Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably, our outlook for our 2011 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. With that, I'd like to introduce our CFO, Brian McKeon.
Brian McKeon: Thanks, Stephen. Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. Our Q4 results were in line with our expectations, capping off a solid year of financial performance for the company. Revenue gains were constrained by continued softness in core service activity levels and lower eDiscovery revenues. Despite these impacts, we continue to drive strong financial results, supported by international growth, expansion of hybrid services and continued productivity gains supporting gross margin improvement.  For the full year, we achieved 4% revenue growth, 9% growth in adjusted OIBDA and double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. Please note that our reported EPS for the fourth quarter of $0.16 per share included a $0.14 per share impact related to the finalization of the digital goodwill impairment charge initially recorded in Q3. Our 2010 results build our strong long-term track record of financial performance. Our focus in recent years has been expanding our leadership position, while optimizing returns in the businesses we’ve built. We continue to advance a disciplined approach to operations management and capital allocation that supported a 440 basis point improvement in adjusted OIBDA margins, and a nearly 1,000 basis point improvement in free cash flow margins over the last four years. These improvements are sustainable and set the foundation for long-term success.  Our confidence in our business model and outlook supported our board's decision to increase our dividend by 200% in December. We intend to build on this track record in 2011. We plan to continue to drive solid free cash flow and adjusted EPS gains, supported by disciplined capital spending and lower interest costs. We're targeting moderate revenue growth despite expected constraints from continued soft core service activity trends and lower eDiscovery revenues. We'll be refining our revenue and adjusted OIBDA outlook today to reflect our updated expectations. Let’s now turn to Slide 4 and begin the review of our financial results. Slide 4 looks at our full year operating performance compared to 2009. As noted, our Q4 results concluded a solid year of financial performance with profitability and cash flow generation reaching record high levels. Revenue increased 4% to $3.1 billion. Gross profit increased 8% to $1.9 billion, reflecting a 210 basis point improvement in gross margin for 2010 compared to 2009. These results are supported by continued benefits from North American productivity initiatives, solid international operating performance and higher recycled paper prices.  Adjusted OIBDA grew 9% for the full year of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Strong gross margin gains, controlled overhead spending and lower incentive compensation expense, which added about three points to growth, drove the increase. Solid operating performance and lower interest expense drove a 17% increase in adjusted EPS compared to 2009. Capital spending was $268 million for 2010, including $14 million for real estate. Strong operating profit gains and capital spending efficiencies drove an 11% increase in 2010 free cash flow, despite a $52 million increase in cash taxes.  Let's now turn to Slide 5 to review our Q4 results. Slide 5 compares our results for this quarter to the fourth quarter of 2009. Q4 results were in line with our outlook. Enterprise revenue growth was 1%, down slightly from Q3, reflecting a moderated benefit from higher recycled paper prices. Enterprise revenue gains were supported by sustained 2% growth in storage revenues and by expansion of hybrid services. These gains offset continued softness in core service activities and lower eDiscovery revenues. From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 1% internal growth, supported by a consistent 1% storage growth, hybrid service gains and benefits from higher recycled paper pricing. These gains were offset by continued soft core service activities.  Our International Physical segment generated 3% internal growth. Storage internal growth remained solid at 6%, supported by strong performance in expansion markets. These gains were offset by core service revenue declines and partly impacted by weather conditions. Reported revenues for this segment grew 2%, net of a 2% negative impact from foreign currency exchange rate changes. In our Digital segment, reported revenues declined 3% in the fourth quarter. Gains in backup and archiving services, reflecting our Mimosa acquisition, were offset by the divestiture of our domain name management product line and declines in eDiscovery revenues. Lower billing levels for eDiscovery in 2010 and the associated impact on deferred revenue recognition will continue to pressure overall Digital revenue growth in 2011. Solid profit gains were supported by a 190 basis point improvement in gross margin. Higher storage gross margins reflected improved pricing and lower facility and insurance costs. Continued benefits from productivity initiatives also drove higher service margins.  Adjusted OIBDA grew 4% to $239 million, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong operating performance and benefits from lower interest expense. Reported EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.16 per share, including the $0.14 per share impact of the $29 million non-cash charge for the finalization of the digital goodwill impairment initially recorded in Q3 of 2010. The structural tax rate for the fourth quarter was 39% in line with expectations. Including the impact of discrete tax items primarily related to the goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 54%. Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 6. Slide 6 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line, as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange compared to our 2010 full year outlook.  For the full year, internal growth was 2% and reported growth was 4%, consistent with our expectations. Total revenue growth from Q4 was 1%, driven by storage internal growth gains. Overall, core revenue growth trends remain relatively consistent in Q4. Complementary revenue growth moderated in the quarter and strong hybrid revenue growth and narrowing gains from higher paper prices were partially offset by lower project revenues and eDiscovery sales. The internal growth rate for core storage revenues for the quarter were sustained at 2%. Global records management net volumes increased modestly in the quarter, as destruction levels remained at relatively higher levels and new sales increases were offset by modest declines in other incoming volume. Pricing trends remain consistent as well with net pricing gains of about 2% in North American records management. A key factor moderating growth involves continued softness in core service activity levels, reflecting impacts from current employment levels and general economic trends. Our updated outlook for 2011 reflects an extension of recent core service trends.  Let's now turn to Slide 7 to review our full year performance on a segment basis. Slide 7 shows key metrics for each of our four segments compared to 2009. North America drove higher profits and strong cash flows in 2010. Adjusted OIBDA in our largest segment increased 12% on 3% reported revenue growth, supported by gross margin gains and controlled overhead spending. Controlled capital spending to over 200 basis point improvement in segment CapEx as a percent of revenues. Our International segment continues to post solid revenue, adjusted OIBDA and cash flow gains supported by growth in expansion partners. Internal growth for the year was 4%, driven by continued strong storage internal growth of 6%. Adjusted OIBDA grew 7% in line with revenue gains. We're targeting solid improvement in international margins in 2011, as we continue to build scale across our International business and drive operational excellence initiatives in the developed markets.  Gains in our Physical business helped to offset a challenging year in our Digital segment. Economic pressures and recent challenges, specifically in our eDiscovery business, constrained growth and lowered digital profits this year. As noted on our Q3 earnings call, we proactively reassessed the value of our digital goodwill in that quarter, which resulted in a preliminary goodwill impairment charge of $255 million related to our Worldwide Digital segment. We finalized our work on the digital valuation in the fourth quarter and recorded an additional $29 million charge to the impairment. This charge impacted our reported Q4 2010 EPS by $0.14.  As Bob will discuss in more detail, we've advanced significant efforts to better integrate our digital services into Iron Mountain to accelerate growth and cost efficiencies. We do expect to be working through tough comparisons in 2011, particularly in areas such as eDiscovery, which will constrain overall digital service revenue gains, but we believe we're on the right track towards strengthened revenue trends and profit performance from our Digital business lines. Overall, the strength of our portfolio provided the foundation for another solid year of financial gains. Let's turn to Slide 8 to review our performance in a longer-term context. Slide 8 highlights the track record of strong financial performance Iron Mountain's achieved over the last four years, a record that we tend to continue building on for the long term.  While economic factors have recently constrained top line growth, we've continued to deliver strong profit and cash flow performance. Over the past four years, while continuing to expand our business foundation and capability, we've driven consistently strong adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS growth well ahead of revenue gains. Additionally, our disciplined approach to capital allocation has supported a 40% improvement in capital efficiency, which along with profit margin gains, has driven free cash flow from 2% of revenues in 2006 to 12% in 2010.  These improvements are sustainable. They reflect the strength of the business model we've built and our growing capabilities in organization. The financial strategies we're advancing should support sustained solid long-term growth in adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We intend to improve our revenue growth trajectory while continuing to improve adjusted OIBDA margins and sustain capital efficiencies. We also intend to drive additional tax efficiencies and manage our balance sheet in a disciplined way that enhances per share returns. Let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss our progress on this front, starting with a review of our debt statistics and cash management initiatives. Substantial gains in cash flow generation has enabled the continued strengthening of our balance sheet. We improved our debt statistics steadily in recent years. Currently, our consolidated leverage ratio was 2.9x at the low end of what we feel is a very manageable 3x to 4x leverage level for our company.  Our debt portfolio at December 31, 2010, remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate was 6.9%, and we were 87% fixed at year end. Maturity is less than seven years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. In September 2010, we used excess cash to redeem $200 million of our 7 3/4% senior subordinated notes due in 2015.  In January of 2011, we used cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the redemption of the remaining $231 million of these bonds. These transactions will reduce our net interest expense by approximately $20 million in 2011, supporting continued growth in adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. Pro forma for the January bond call were about 80% fixed with respect to interest rates.  We're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. At quarter end, liquidity was more than $1 billion with $259 million in cash and $763 million in additional borrowing capacity. In January of 2011, we used cash on hand and $180 million of borrowings to fund the bond redemption I just mentioned. Our cash management strategies evolved in important ways in 2010.  Let's now turn to Slide 10 to discuss the advancement of shareholder payouts as part of our financial approach. Our track record in growing our cash flows and strengthening our balance sheet, combined with our confidence in our ability to grow our business profitably, supported our decision to initiate a shareholder payout program in 2010. This program is comprised of two important elements: a quarterly dividend and an authorization to repurchase shares.  Our dividend currently stands at $0.75 per share on an annual basis, following the announcement in December of 2010 that our board had increased our quarterly dividend by 200%. This dividend provides a solid foundation to our payout program. We're paying a dividend that is currently yielding above 3%, and we expect to increase the dividend on an annual basis as we continue to expand our free cash flow.  In 2010, we also announced that our board had authorized a total of $350 million for the repurchase of our shares. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 773,000 shares of our stock for approximately $17 million. For the full year 2010, we repurchased 4.8 million shares for approximately $111 million. This leaves us a balance of $239 million for additional share repurchases under our existing authorization. We intend to invest excess cash flow in share repurchases as part of our financial strategy, and are committed to managing our balance sheet in a disciplined way to enhance per share value for our investors.  That concludes our review of 2010 financial performance. Let's now move to Slide 11 and discuss how we intend to build on that progress through a review of our 2011 outlook. Slide 11 highlights key factors supporting our outlook for 2011 financial performance. We're maintaining a measured outlook on revenue growth while continuing to drive solid profit and cash flow gains. We're targeting 2% to 4% revenue growth this year, with gains supported by progress on new sales, hybrid services development and international expansion. As I'll discuss in more detail, our updated outlook is for 0% to 2% internal growth as we extend recent trends in core service activities and reflect expectations for lower eDiscovery revenues.  We're targeting solid underlying gains in adjusted OIBDA, supported by continued focus on productivity improvement in our North American field and support operations, and progress in strengthening international returns. These gains will enable us to advance about $20 million of the investments in sales and marketing capabilities in support of accelerated new sales growth. On a reported basis, our outlook is for adjusted OIBDA growth in the 0% to 3%. This outlook assumes a return to normal incentive compensation levels in 2011, following lower than normal payouts in 2010. This impact will lower adjusted OIBDA growth rate about 3% in 2011. Finally, we expect to drive continued solid adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth, benefiting from disciplined cash management. Adjusted EPS will benefit from lower interest costs, reflecting recent refinancing activities. We're also projecting benefits from our lower shares outstanding at the end of 2010, reflecting our share repurchase program. Our free cash flow outlook is also supported by projections for lower interest in capital spending. Continue projecting improvements in capital spending as a percent of sales reflect benefits from capital allocation flows, lower volume growth, moderate pricing gains and favorable impacts from the expansion of less capital intensive services. Let's turn to Slide 12 for a look at our expected revenue growth rates for 2011. The table on Slide 12 breaks down key drivers of revenue growth in 2011. Our outlook is for 2% to 4% Enterprise revenue growth. As noted, we're targeting internal growth in the 0% to 2% range. This growth outlook is in a similar range to recent trends, adjusting for the about 1% growth benefit we saw last year related to the strong recovery in recycled paper pricing. Storage growth is projected in the 2% to 3% range with expectations for strengthening performance as we work through the year and benefit from new sales initiatives. We're projecting core service growth in the 0% to 2% range, as benefits from higher recurring hybrid project sales offset recent soft trends in areas such as transportation activity. We're planning for declines in complementary revenues this year in the range of 5% to 10%. This primarily reflects expectations for lower revenue in eDiscovery, the lapping of a large product in Europe and tougher comps in recycled paper. Acquisitions in FX at current exchange rate levels should contribute about 1% to 2% to Enterprise revenue growth this year.  Let's turn to Slide 13 that summarize our 2011 outlook. Slide 13 summarizes our full year 2011 financial guidance. We've adjusted our enterprise revenue outlook to be in the range of $3,175,000,000 to $3,240,000,000, up 2% to 4%. This is moderately lower than our preliminary outlook shared at Investor Day, primarily reflecting our updated view on 2011 eDiscovery revenue and an extension of continued soft trends in core service activity. As noted, we're targeting improved revenue performance as we work through the year. Our toughest revenue comparisons for complementary and core service revenues will be in the first quarter. We're targeting adjusted OIBDA of $941 million to $971 million. This represents reported growth of the 0% to 3%, including incremental sales and marketing investments. We're increasing our free cash flow outlook to $375 million to $410 million, reflecting solid operating performance, lower interest expense and estimated capital expenditures of about $245 million for the year. We increased our CapEx outlook slightly to reflect recent acquisition activity and refinement to our spending plans. The capital outlook includes about $20 million from real estate. Our outlook is for adjusted EPS to grow between 5% and 13% to a range of $1.21 to $1.30 per share, assuming 200 million shares outstanding. This reflects our shares outstanding at year end, which are about 2% below average 2009 levels.  We would like to highlight a change in our approach to financial guidance this year. In order to reinforce our focus on full year financial progress and the progress that we're making against our strategic agenda, we decided to eliminate specific quarterly guidance. Instead, we'll provide qualitative information to indicate how our business is trending in the near term. We'll continue to provide annual guidance, which we'll update as necessary on our quarterly earnings calls.  Turning to Slide 14. You can see our expectations for the PL below the adjusted OIBDA line for the full year 2011. G&A expense is consistent with 2010 levels and interest expense is down about 10%, reflecting the bond redemptions we completed in September and January. We're expecting our structural tax rate to be about 39% for 2011. In summary, 2010 was a solid year of financial progress, building on our strong track record of performance. Strong execution drove record profitability and free cash flow despite moderating revenue growth. Our business platform is solid and we remain confident in our long-term potential, and we look forward to building on our strong financial performance in 2011 and beyond.  Thank you, and now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert Brennan: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. 2010 was another solid year of financial performance for Iron Mountain, as we posted our 22nd consecutive year of storage revenue growth. We reached record high levels for adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow. We also continued to strengthen our balance sheet and confidently advanced our first shareholder payout program. Brian has reviewed the details of both the quarter and the year, so I'm going to talk about Iron Mountain from my vantage point and share my thoughts on where we are, how we're doing and how we think about creating value.  Let me start by reminding us what a great business we have. Iron Mountain is global leader in information management services. We have operations in more than 35 countries, expanding five continents. We are the global leader in storage and management of paper records, the off-site storage and management of backup data and in secure document shredding, which we call the Box, Tape and Shred businesses. We provide superior security, storage and access through an integrated global service model and a footprint that is unmatched by our competition.  These physical services comprise 89% of our total revenues and are all built on a strong foundation of recurring revenues comprised of storage and related services. We call our recurring storage and service revenue streams core revenues. Core revenues form a durable annuity revenue stream that is sustained over time. In 2005, these core revenues were 87% of our total revenues. And five years later in 2010, core revenues remain at 87%. This great business is built on a financial model that has four pillars.  The first is that we have a recurring revenue growth stream that flows from existing customers. It's augmented by growth from the continued penetration of the unmended market.  The second pillar is that our revenue comes from a very diversified and stable customer base. We provide service to over 150,000 customers in more than 90% of the Fortune 1000. We've got very low churn, typically in the 1% to 2% range, and that has been the case over time. We have strong penetration in key factors such as financial services, legal services and healthcare. And we continue to build out new sectors such as retail and government. The third pillar is that our value proposition enables us to achieve attractive adjusted OIBDA margins and expanded free cash flow. Our North American Physical margins were 36% in 2007, and they were 44% this past year. I point this out because we fundamentally have the same business globally, and we're well positioned to drive higher returns across the rest of world geographies. This dynamic supported growth of 9% in adjusted OIBDA and 11% growth in free cash flow this year. The fourth pillar is that our capital investment is driven most significantly by growth investments. This key element of our business allows us to maintain disciplined controls of our capital allocation, ensuring we continue to earn attractive return on incremental investments. Now these four pillars have remained consistent over time. Recurring revenue, a stable customer base, consistently growing free cash flow and growth-driven capital investments. This fundamental has emerged as we move towards the focus on organic growth, increasing the returns on capital. We're demonstrating the underlying attractiveness of our business and capitalizing on the investments made during the acquisition phase of the company's development to deliver steady improvements in ROIC, which reached 7.7% on an after-tax basis this year. Steadily improving ROIC performance is supported by centralized capital controls and rigorous ROI-based investment decisions. Iron Mountain is the global leader with a significant competitive advantage in a business where we have structurally attractive fundamentals. So let's talk about how we got here. We've built our global leadership position by executing a long-term strategy of three distinct but overlapping phases. In the first phase, we acquired companies. At our peak, we were buying a company every three weeks. This period was characterized by high growth and high capital investment to acquire companies and then integrate and bring them into our operating standards. We focused our organization on acquiring a broader footprint to achieve strategic advantage.  In Phase 2, we continued to acquire companies and focused on building our sales capabilities to penetrate the local and national markets where we had been acquiring companies. The margins contracted during this phase because we knew it was important to build out the selling capabilities, and there was infrastructure requirements as well to run the businesses we had bought. We continued to roll off of the industry in the second phase and also began to pursue operational excellence. And it's during the last few years, that we have continued to capitalize on this opportunity, where we've been carefully targeting SG&A investments to achieve higher realized returns. We’ve been achieving this operational excellence through specific initiatives around optimized pricing, transportation, workflow and purchasing, all the while setting consistent high-performance standards across our business and for our industry. This focus has yielded both competitive and financial gains, with adjusted OIBDA margins increasing 440 basis points, and free cash flow margins increasing nearly 1,000 basis points over the last four years.  As we evolved, we also expanded our service lines through M&A and internal investments to create a range of technology services that extend from our core Physical services and offer the same fundamental value proposition. These offerings include close-in adjacent hybrid services that help our customers remove inefficiencies from document processes, as well as services that support the management of digital data. The ability to help customers manage their records and data across information formats is a capability unique to Iron Mountain, and it supports the long-term growth of all of our services. Now this three-phased approach that I've described has not been without its speed bumps and missteps, but we have managed to achieve our major strategic goals while also delivering strong, improved financial performance. This strategy built the global leadership position we currently have in box, tape and shredding services. We’re well positioned to help our customers manage hybrid record processes as document processes become more digital.  We're also a leading provider of Digital services with industry-leading offerings for backup, archival and litigation support. Our approach to technology services is one of a services strategy, and that Iron Mountain delivers the same value across all of our services in OnDemand platform, high security and compliance embedded into each of our services. They all offer a low capital, low risk option for our customers versus doing it themselves. Through these three phases, we've built a company with a strong sustainable competitive position. We've also demonstrated the power of our financial model through continued growth, expanding cash flows and a strong balance sheet.  So that's history. Let's talk now about current trends and how we're managing today. While our financial performance continues to strengthen, we are operating in a lower growth environment. I want to describe how we think about that and plan to address this current trajectory.  Growth slowed meaningfully during the recession. Prior to the recession, our growth was tracking steadily in the high single-digit range. Our growth has slowed to the low single-digit range. We see this change as primarily related to changes in the economy, which lowered overall levels of business activity and drove customers to increase their focus on cost control. Growth is also impacted by execution shortfalls in our Digital business unit.  Our decline in growth rate lagged the decline of the overall economy, and we expect that any recovery will also lag the general recovery. Despite these significant impacts, our business continues to expand. Our physical services grew 3% worldwide in 2010, led by international growth of 6%. Box revenues were up 2% last year despite volume growth being constrained by higher levels of destruction activity and pressured service activity levels. Tape revenues were up 3%. Shredding posted solid global revenue gains of 12%, supported by higher paper prices. Technology services, which include hybrid and digital solutions, grew 7% overall, supported by approximately 20% expansion in hybrid services and gains in digital backup and archiving. As we move forward, our focus is on driving new sales to help move our overall growth trajectory higher and position ourselves to long-term expansion.  In North America, we're applying our operating profits focus to our go-to-market capability and increasing our emphasis on the Box business, to complement the progress we've made in driving higher hybrid sales recently. We have significant unmended market opportunities for our box, tape and shredded services. We're investing in increased sales, marketing and product management capability to support new customer acquisition and segmented service line development. We're starting to build momentum on this front and are experiencing benefits and expecting benefit from the second half of 2011 that will position us for improving momentum going into 2012.  In our International Physical business, we intend to build on our solid momentum. We posted 6% internal growth in storage in the International business through investment in expansion markets, sales and marketing capability and of course, our core business in the U.K. In our technology service offerings, we intend to build on our progress in hybrid service expansion and address key drivers of recent underperformance in Digital services. In Digital, our CloudRecovery in Digital archiving expanded last year, supported by our Mimosa acquisition. However, we experienced a rapid change in eDiscovery business, which declined 10% and pressured our profits. We also had management execution issues in part of our Digital business that caused us to fell well short of our profit plan. These factors caused our Digital segments to suffer a contribution decline of 45%. We’ve corrected these issues and reduced our cost structure in line with current revenues. The impact on revenue growth from eDiscovery will continue into 2011, but our cost actions will offset these impacts, sustain margins and position us well for profit gain as get growth back on track. The key change element we have advanced is the integration of the full scope of services across our business. One of our competitive advantages is the ability to offer solutions across Physical and Digital formats in an integrated offering. This advantage really aids growth across our service lines, as we've seen just in the expansion of our hybrid offerings. We will apply these same principles to improve our Digital business.  Now in order to start our Digital business, we initially operated as a separate and somewhat redundant organization. Our structure served us well as we established our products and built capability. Now to take advantage of the products and capability we've built, we've decided it's time to integrate our Digital services more fully into our overall operations.  We started this process during 2010. Our first step was to integrate our separate sales forces under a common management structure. This is being followed by the integration of our service delivery organizations. This further integration of our business will produce more efficiency going forward and build upon the Iron Mountain strength of providing our customers an integrated approach to their information management problems regardless of location, regardless of format. So that's how we're managing today and how we intend to drive growth and improve performance in the near term. Let me now describe how this points to our approach for creating shareholder value.  Value creation comes down to how well we manage the business and how well we invest your capital. We take this responsibility seriously. We're managing the business to grow free cash flow and grow returns on invested capital. In this context, you should hear that our primary investment focus is on growing our business organically and continuing to optimize the highly attractive business we've built. In terms of organic revenue growth, we'll continue to invest both capital and operating expense to grow our revenues. We know we have significant untapped market opportunities across our service lines.  Our 2011 budget includes significant incremental investments in sales and marketing to support higher growth. We're also investing growth capital directed at the expansion of our International Physical business. We know this business well. Its performance has been improving steadily and we have a clear line of sight to attractive incremental returns. Now if our investments in organic growth yield the returns as planned, we'll keep investing. And if they don't, we'll adjust our spending appropriately. In terms of margins and capital efficiency, we will continue to invest to drive productivity improvement that support long-term margin gains and continued capital efficiencies. The majority of the margin growth over the next few years will come from our International business. We're going to use the same techniques and programs that increased North American margins by more than 800 basis points since 2007. And of course, we'll also maintain our focus on capital efficiencies across our entire business. Acquisitions. We will complement investments towards organic growth and productivity with targeted acquisition investments. We will consider specific acquisitions that help round out our service offerings in areas like hybrid services, as well as fold-in acquisitions that help us drive margin on a local scale. Our primary focus will be on select expansion in international markets including the purchase of joint venture interests. In this context, we're excited to announce the recent acquisition of the remaining 80% in our Poland joint venture. The key message related to acquisitions is that we will be targeted in our approach. Our focus is on small and midsized opportunities that are closed in and have a clear path to value creation. I don't foresee a significant transaction that would change our risk profile. Built a great business, and we're focused on investing to take full advantage of what we have built.  Balance sheet management is another key element of our approach to value creation. Continuing to grow revenues and free cash flow, we will continue to use various financial strategies to enhance returns for our shareholders on both the current basis and in support of share value appreciation. Our predictable and growing free cash flow gives us current cash from operations after fully funding internal capital needs and significant borrowing capacity to invest. The strength of our balance sheet and cash flows enabled us to confidently advance shareholder payouts as part of our financial strategy. We started our first ever dividend payment last year and recently increased the dividend substantially, reflecting confidence in our ability to grow and expand cash flows.  Given our strong operating cash generation and current acquisition outlook, we also intend to support share repurchases at prices that create value for our shareholders. We're in the early stages of this process and have purchased more than 2% of our shares since we started the program. Share repurchases, along with tax strategy and debt cost optimization, will help us drive solid adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow growth over time. Summary. We intend to invest appropriately to grow and improve our business over time, increasing its future value while managing excess cash flows to provide current yield and create additional value. So thanks for allowing me to go on a little longer than usual. I wanted to provide context about how we built market leadership, to discuss where we are and how we intend to create value. We remain committed to solid execution of an investment plan that will reward our stakeholders year in and year out. I appreciate the input and insights you offered Brian and me throughout the year. And now we'd both like to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: I wonder if you could talk just a little bit about the leverage ratios. We're down to 2.9% right now and I know we recently took the range down to 3% to 4%. As you think about that, Brian, going forward, can you help us kind of is 3% to 4% the new normal or do you envision given the strength of the free cash flow that, that's going to continue to trend down? Or how we should think about the dividend versus buy back within the context of the leverage ratio overall?
Brian McKeon: We have said that 3% to 4% is a leverage range that we're quite comfortable in. As you point out, it's right now at the low end of that range. In terms of how we're managing that, we obviously have increased the dividend pretty substantially. We think we're in a good level there. We're looking to increase that over time as we go free cash flow, but we think that we've established the dividend as an important part of our financial approach and we will continue to buy back shares. I think we have a significant amount available under our existing authorization. We see that as a key point of our financial strategy as well, and that will enable us to have another vehicle to create value and to manage the leverage ratios and acquisitions are part of that equation as well. So net-net, I think we're comfortable operating at or slightly below the low end of the range, and we may spike up over time depending on how we choose to deploy capital given the opportunities that we have. But right now, we're comfortable where we are and we'll continue to evaluate that.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: The SG&A, it looks that ticked up a little bit in the fourth quarter and I know that was from some targeted initiatives. Can you just help us understand what they're related to? Was that kind of sales people in hybrid services or just kind of what that related to?
Brian McKeon: It is principally related to a combination of growth and productivity initiatives, but we had started to accelerate the investments in sales and marketing that we've been highlighting. And maybe Bob can talk a bit more about that.
Robert Brennan: Kevin, we've been bolstering our product management marketing and selling capabilities. You've heard me refer as the go-to-market effort over the past couple of years and we've made a lot of progress as we came towards the back half of the year. And embedded in my comments is the fact that 2011, we will continue to make significant incremental investments in this capability as we see it generate the right kind of progress. And we're seeing that kind of progress, so we feel pretty good about that.
Brian McKeon: We were also -- similar to what we did in North America, we do made targeted investments in the SG&A line and currently in our International business that will enable us to drive gross margin improvement over time, the operational excellence initiatives. So there's some of that as well. But net-net, the overall equation continues to work well for us and we're pleased to have delivered good profit growth this year and look to build on that next year.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: And Brian, I know you kind of talked about targeted cost savings in North America as a result of those OpEx initiatives. Do you have any type of range for Europe or what we could expect over the next couple of years as a result of that?
Brian McKeon: We've spoken about the longer-term goal in our international operations to increase our adjusted OIBDA margins by 100 basis points or more annually. And we haven't gotten more specific than that, Kevin. But I can tell you that 2011, we're definitely targeting strong margin improvement in international and that's a key factor that's allowing us to advance incremental sales and marketing investment and address some of the lapping issues that we've highlighted.
Robert Brennan: Actually, Kevin, Brian and I just got back from visiting the international team and the way that they're getting after this with execution is very encouraging. And it helps that North America paved the way over the last four years, so we have a playbook here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: For starters, what do you think is driving the modest declines in incoming volumes from existing customers? Seems like the economy picked up a little more pace during the fourth quarter, so I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on that. Is it just the late cycle nature playing out or is there anything else there?
Robert Brennan: Vance, we lagged coming in, we lagged coming out. We've been -- that showed in our results, we are seeing stabilization. And we expected any benefits that we, in the economy will benefit our business, although it will be on a lagged basis. We're not planning for those benefits, but we feel pretty good that we're on track as we start the year.
Brian McKeon: Vance, sort of the key thing is that it's more similar than different. We always have some movement on the margin in different areas, I would say, where net-net, the volume has been within the similar range in Q4. It has been kind of in a similar zone for a couple of quarters. We feel good about the progress that we're making to influence the new sales side, and we think we're on track and look at targeting improved performance as we work through the year.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: And as a follow-up on an earlier question, sounds like there are more benefits ahead from productivity initiatives and there will also be more investments to that end as well. Where would you say we are in that overall process? Has most of it run its course or have we barely scratched the surface? If you could just give a feel for where we are in that process.
Brian McKeon: We tried to break this down a little bit at Investor Day in terms of where we'll drive margin improvement over time. And in North America, we continue their work to get better and we shoot to have our profits grow faster than our revenues. But we have seen substantial benefit from productivity initiatives, and we've recognized that obviously in our financial performance. International, we're in much earlier innings in terms of what we believe we can achieve there. We are going to balance that over time with continued investment towards growth. The International businesses is growing quite well. We continue to have strong storage gains and very optimistic about the potential in that business. And that'll be the -- that earlier innings will be a bigger driver going forward, as Bob highlighted.
Robert Brennan: You're right, Vance. You do have to invest to get the productivity and you have to invest to get the growth, and we're careful to make those investments. And as they pay off, we continue to invest and if they don't, we adjust our investments accordingly.
Brian McKeon: We're obviously in a moderate growth zone currently. As we increase our growth rate, improve our growth, which is our intent, we should be able to get more benefit out of overall overhead leverage as well. It's just when we're in a more moderate growth range, it's a little tougher to do that.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: How should we think about maintenance CapEx levels in terms of when we might get there, if ever, what those levels might look like? Could you provide some color on that?
Brian McKeon: Sure. We're enhancing our capital disclosure in our 10-K, which will be available in a couple of days to provide a more granular look at where we invest capital. And the bulk of our capital view is growth oriented. That includes capacity expansion, it includes investments that we make in improving our products, as well as some targeted investment in new products. We invest in things like operational efficiencies. So I think the true maintenance capital required in a business is low, but we continue to grow as a business and improve our product offering. And we're comfortable with our outlook, which we've said over time, we think we can sustain capital spending in the range of 7% to 8% of sales even as we improve -- that's excluding real estate, even after we improve our revenue growth, our outlook for 2011 is roughly 7%. So we think we can sustain the good capital efficiencies that we've driven and drive cash flow higher.
Robert Brennan: Sustainability is a key theme you'll hear from us, Vance. And fundamentally, if you step back, that's a result of us investing and having a better competitive position in our industry than really anybody and those investments pay off a good bit. Sustainability is about making them and continually increasing your competitive position.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of Barclays Capital.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: How are revenues overall from existing customers trending if you combine the higher destructions and the lower incoming volumes? Is it down at a mid-single digits rate or how should we think about that?
Brian McKeon: We continually try to highlight the overall volume and records management was relatively flat. So we are seeing continued higher levels of outgoing volume, net-net some destruction activity offset by incoming volumes. So that's been the trend for the last few quarters and we came from a place where we're growing mid-single digit before the economic downturn, so we are targeting improvement as we move forward.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: Can you break that out between new sales and existing -- it sounds like existing customer volumes must be down quite a bit. But you've got a new sales effort that's offsetting that and getting that to flat?
Brian McKeon: New sales are a relatively small driver of the volume growth in the short term at the margin, right? It builds as an annuity over time. So the existing customer volume in the quarter was down slightly. But if this is net-net, new sales are not a huge driver of our volume growth at the margin.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: Can you tell us how large the eDiscovery business is? Just what’s the scale relative to other businesses in Digital? And if that continues to go lower, I guess I'm curious what cost actions you're taking? You said you're going to be able to maintain margins, I believe, for this year?
Robert Brennan: Yes. It's just below a $50 million business, Gary. Fundamentally, we have taken cost actions relative to our cost reserve to provide service on a given matter. The other thing that we've done is really integrated under Harry Ebbighausen's leadership into our overall business, as I mentioned in my remarks. So there are things like when we see customers pulling hard copy records being able to isolate them and understand if they're subject to litigation, that we're -- I'm comfortable with the progress that we're seeing in our execution on that front. It was a combination of the pricing in the market plummeted very quickly as a result of secular trends in that space, and we weren't quick enough from an execution perspective to write our cost structure. We are writing that cost structure and I think we're doing a much better job identifying and pursuing new opportunities. So I'm confident that, that would stabilize that business. Although because of the way that we booked the revenue, the effects of the down of 2010 will flow into 2011.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: Can you give us a sense what your exposure to energy prices is? I guess I'm thinking gasoline or diesel for the delivery trucks and shredding trucks and electricity. Should we think about the recent spike in prices being a big impact in your gross margins or is it a pretty small percent of revenue?
Brian McKeon: It won't have much of an effect in that -- first of all, overall energy costs are about 2% to 3% of our revenues and we actually have fuel surcharges as part of our business model. So when the -- at least the energy cost is split pretty evenly between utility cost and transportation cost. And for the transport piece, when the prices rise, we have an offsetting fuel surcharge. It doesn't help profitability, it doesn't hurt. It just helps us to mitigate that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Usually, first quarter is a good sequential quarter from the fourth quarter. I guess people clean up their records, and there's just more activity in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. And obviously, that was not the case for Iron Mountain in the first quarter 2010 and 2009 because of the recession. But if you can make some qualitative comment about sequential revenues first quarter 2011 versus fourth quarter on storage and service, we'd appreciate it.
Brian McKeon: Yes, I think we tend to look at these things year-on-year, Andrew. I think we are expecting to have some tougher comparisons in areas like complementary revenues in Q1 and that we're lapping some of the paper prices come down from some of its peak. So we're not going to have the same benefits that we did last year. We've got some special projects that we're lapping there and the kind of extension of the core service trends we've seen recently compared will continue to be a factor in moderating growth. We intend to continue to march forward with expanding our storage revenues and expect kind of similar seasonal effects. So that's how we're looking at them.
Robert Brennan: The purge effects that you're referring to in Q1 really come later in the quarter, then it's not a January 1 kind of thing. So we wouldn't even have a line of sight to that at this point.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Right. But you do agree with me that first quarter generally, historically, with the exception of the last two years, has shown good sequential lift from the fourth quarter. And I just was wondering if there's anything that you're seeing aberrational this year given the previous two years?
Brian McKeon: We're planning for similar seasonal trends.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Eric Boyer of Wells Fargo.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Can you just go over the expectations for net pricing gains in 2011 versus '10? I think you said 2% in North America Physical for 2011, if I have that right?
Brian McKeon: It's North American records management. And the net pricing has been turning at about the 2% range, and that's our expectation for this year as well.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And then I understand you have an offsetting fuel surcharge for some of the transportation services. But I was wondering when you look back at prior gas price spikes, did it have any impact on falling incremental services revenue as the cost go up for clients or is that cost increase so small, it really isn't much of a factor?
Brian McKeon: It did. A couple of years back, it added some at the margin to our core service growth about 220 basis points -- $20 million. And we'll highlight that for you as we work through the year if that becomes a material factor.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And did you say lower incentive comp was a 3% benefit in 2010? Just want to make sure I had that right.
Brian McKeon: That's correct. Just 3% 2010, and we're claiming for normal levels this year so that's factored into our outlook.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: So that would be like a 3% headwind year-over-year then? '11?
Brian McKeon: That's exactly right.
Operator: That question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup.
Philip Stiller: This is Phil Stiller, in for Ashwin. Just following up on the first quarter question for -- I know last year you had some impacts from adverse weather. And given the heightened storms this year, just wondering what you're expecting on that front?
Robert Brennan: It's an impact in parts of the country and we saw it on some service activity volumes. Snow removal costs that -- it spikes, but it's very much on the margin. I'm actually -- I like the way that we're starting the year and we're on track to really build on the performance that we had in 2010 in 2011. So I feel pretty good about the start.
Philip Stiller: I know you guys just commented on the pricing for the storage, but can you comment on what kind of pricing trend you see in terms of core services?
Robert Brennan: It's pretty consistent. We take a measured approach to this. In 2009, we really start to get after this with discipline and we're taking a very measured, consistent, sustainable approach to pricing.
Philip Stiller: And then lastly, I know, Brian, you alluded to some tax rate planning that you're doing. You're kind of expecting the tax rate to be flat this year. Just wondering when we could start to see some benefits from that and what are your kind of longer-term expectations for that?
Brian McKeon: We think over time, we can reduce structural tax rate 200 to 300 basis points and that will continue to benefit as we expand. We'll see those benefits as we continue to expand our international profits. So there's a number of factors that we build into the one year outlook. But over time, we do think we can drive additional efficiency there.
Robert Brennan: Well thank you all this morning for allowing us to explain our 2010 performance and the financial progress that we really made building on our strong track record. We look forward to reporting to you again in April and speaking about the progress that we're making here in 2011. Enjoy the rest of your today.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2010 Q3  (2010-10-28 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Brian McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Executive Vice President Robert Brennan - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Stephen Golden - Vice President of Investor Relations
Analysts: Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley David Gold - Sidoti & Company, LLC Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. John Mirshekari Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research
Operator: Good morning. My name is Bonnie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Call Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen Golden, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Golden, you may begin your conference, sir.
Stephen Golden: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our 2010 third quarter earnings conference call. After my announcements this morning, Brian McKeon will review our financial results, followed by Bob Brennan's CEO remarks. When Bob is finished with his comments, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who attended our 13th Annual Investor Day in New York earlier this month. We are pleased with the turnout, and hope you found the presentations informative. As always, we appreciate your support. For our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2010 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide or our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before discretionary acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently, and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release. With that, I'd like to introduce our CFO, Brian McKeon.
Brian McKeon: Thanks, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. We continue to drive strong financial performance in the third quarter. Reported revenue growth for the quarter of 2% was in line with our outlook. Results were supported by solid gains in our International Physical segment, strong growth in hybrid services and benefits from higher recycled paper prices. Revenue growth continues to be constrained by economic factors, which contributed to very soft core service activity this summer. Adjusted OIBDA came in above the high end of our guidance range, driven by continued benefits from productivity initiatives and lower incentive compensation accruals. Adjusted OIBDA increased 13% in Q3 and 11% year-to-date versus the prior year. Adjustments to incentive compensation accruals added about five points of growth in Q3 and four points of growth on a year-to-date basis. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35 per share, an increase of 39% compared to the same period last year. Our reported EPS was a loss of $0.76 per share, including a $1.24 per share after-tax charge for the Digital goodwill impairment. As we proactively advance changes to improve performance in our Digital business, we evaluated our Digital business carrying value, resulting in a $255 million estimated goodwill impairment charge. We'll finalize the amount in the fourth quarter and record any adjustment if necessary at that time. It's important to note that this charge does not impact revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS or free cash flow. Both Bob and I will discuss this more fully later in our remarks. Also included in reported EPS were benefits for the impacts on Other Income and our effective tax rate related to the weakening of the U.S. dollar within the quarter and the gain on the sale of our domain name management product line. For the full year, we're raising our adjusted OIBDA outlook reflecting the strong year-to-date performance and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. We're also raising our full year cash flow outlook to reflect lower capital spending projections and expected benefits from recently enacted U.S. tax legislation. We're refining our revenue outlook as well to incorporate current internal growth trends and foreign currency exchange rates. Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin our review of the third quarter results. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the third quarter of 2009. Q3 was another solid quarter of financial performance. Enterprise revenue growth was 2%, in line with our outlook with overall gains constrained by continued softness in core service activity. Continued strong profit performance was supported gross margin gains and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 2% internal growth supported by strong complementary service revenue performance, including benefits from higher paper pricing and hybrid service revenues. Storage internal growth was 1% in Q3. North American records management volume growth moderated as continued higher outgoing volumes offset new sales gains. As expected, there was some moderation in average net price gains, which are now trending in the 2% range for Records Management, due in part to lower CPI levels. Episodic destructions in our Physical Data Protection business constrained growth in that service line and also contributed to lower storage revenue growth. Core service revenues declined this summer, consistent with overall soft economic conditions. Our International Physical segment generated 5% internal growth. Storage internal growth was a solid 6%, supported by strong performance in the expansion markets. Reported revenues for this segment were 3%, including the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes. In our Digital segment, reported revenue declined 1% in the third quarter as gains in backup and archiving services were offset by the divestiture of our domain name management product line and continued pressure on eDiscovery revenues. We expect continued pressure on Digital revenue growth in the near term as we work through comparisons to stronger prior year growth in areas such as eDiscovery. We continue to translate moderate overall revenue growth into strong gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 6% versus the prior year, yielding a 220 basis points margin improvement. Higher storage gross margins, particularly in the International segment are supporting these gains. Continued benefits from productivity initiatives drove higher service margins, which were also a key contributor to our improved performance. Adjusted OIBDA grew 13% to $254 million. This increase was driven by gross profit gains, controlled SG&A spending and lower incentive compensation expense, which added about five points of growth in the quarter. These gains were partially offset by Mimosa integration costs and targeted investments in growth initiatives. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $77 million and amortization was $10 million, in line with our forecast. Other Income for the quarter was $9 million, including a $7 million gain on the sale of our domain name management program line and a $4 million gain related to foreign currency rate changes in the quarter. These were offset by an early debt extinguishment charge of $2 million. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35 per share, an increase of 39% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong operating performance combined with lower interest expense. Reported EPS for the second quarter was a loss of $0.76 per share, including the impact of the $255 million non-cash charge for the Digital goodwill impairment. The structural tax rate for the third quarter was 38%, in line with our expectations. Including the impact of discrete tax items primarily related to the impairment charge, the effective tax rate for the quarter was minus 16%. It was minimal tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment charge as the majority of goodwill associated with our Digital business is non-deductible. Also included as discrete tax items was a reversal of worldwide tax reserves due to lapses of statue of limitation periods and settlements with taxing authorities, and the positive impact of foreign exchange rate changes in the quarter. These benefits more than offset a charge to establish a valuation allowance, reflecting recently enacted U.S. legislative changes impacting the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. We expect the structural tax rate for 2010 to be 39%. Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange compared to our 2010 full year outlook. Total internal growth for the quarter was 2%, consistent with the prior quarter. Economic factors continue to constrain service activity levels and storage growth. Core activity correlates with employment and general economic trends and has remained soft in recent quarters. The internal growth rate for core storage revenues was 2% in the quarter. Records Management volume growth moderated slightly as continued higher outgoing volume levels in North America offset new sales gains and solid momentum in international markets. Storage revenue growth also reflected moderated average net pricing gains in North American Records Management and episodic destructions in the Physical Data Protection business. We expect Storage internal growth for 2010 to be in the 2% to 3% range. Core revenue internal growth was 1% in the third quarter, primarily reflecting lower core service activity levels. We're planning for continued weakness in core service revenues until we see clear signs of improvement. For the full year, we expect core revenue internal growth to be in the 1% range. Solid growth in our complementary service revenues was supported by higher recycled paper prices and strong gains in hybrid service revenues. These gains were partially offset by lower eDiscovery revenues and the lapping of a large European project. Overall, revenue growth trends remain relatively consistent. Income and volume growth is stabilizing, and we're seeing some improvement in new sales. Offsetting these trends are continued weakness in core service activities and moderated net average pricing in the North American Box business, due in part to lower CPI rates. As a result, we expect full year internal growth to be in the 2% to 3% range. At recent exchange rates, we expect the FX impact to increase revenue growth this year by about 1%. Acquisitions net of the domain name product line divestiture are expected to add less than 1% to total growth. Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our year-to-date performance. Slide 6 shows our year-to-date operating performance compared to the first nine months of 2009. Despite the ongoing economic factors that are constraining revenue growth, we continue to drive strong profit and cash flow performance. Gross profit increased 9% to $1.4 billion, yielding a 220 basis point improvement in gross margin for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same prior-year period. These results are supported by continued benefits from North American productivity initiatives, solid international operating performance and higher recycled paper prices. Gross profit gains are sustainable and position us well for flow-through benefits for higher growth when the economic conditions improve. Adjusted OIBDA grew 11% for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Strong gross margin gains, controlled overhead spending and lower incentive compensation expense, which added about four points to growth, drove the increase. Solid underlying operating performance and lower interest expense drove a 24% increase in adjusted EPS compared to the first nine months of 2009. Disciplined capital spending combined with strong operating profit gains drove a 12% increase in year-to-date free cash flow compared to the same prior year period. Let's move now to Slide 7 for a year-to-date review from a segment perspective. Slide 7 shows key metrics for each of our four segments compared to the first nine months of 2009. The strength of our business portfolio is enabling strong sustainable financial performance. Our year-to-date results reflect solid gains in our North America and International Physical business segments. North America, our largest segment, continues to post solid revenue growth while driving higher profits and strong cash flows. As highlighted at Investor Day, we're capitalizing on our leadership in this segment to expand our services and drive the strong returns that flow from our recurring revenue model. Our International segment is delivering solid revenue gains supported by strong growth in the expansion markets. Select cost accrual impacts have lowered International segment adjusted OIBDA by about $8 million year-to-date. Excluding these effects, the segment is driving solid comparable margin gains and strong profit growth. These gains reflect benefits from driving operational excellence initiatives in the developed markets and from building scale across our business. Continued benefits in these areas are expected to be a key contributor to our overall profit performance going forward. In our Digital business, we continue to work through economic impacts that have pressured this business in recent quarters. As Bob will discuss in more detail, we're actively advancing efforts to better integrate our Digital services into Iron Mountain, to accelerate growth and cost efficiencies. As noted earlier, we proactively reassessed the value of our Digital goodwill in Q3. This resulted in a $255 million impairment related to our worldwide Digital segment and a $1.24 reduction of reported EPS. This impairment reflects a combination of factors including recent economic pressures on the Digital business and specific recent challenges related to our eDiscovery business. At a higher level, it's taking longer than originally anticipated to build this business towards higher scale and profitability. We're taking proactive steps to improve performance in Digital, including changing leadership, integrating sales efforts to drive our growth and integrating elements of support operations to drive cost efficiencies. Digital services are an important part of our integrated value proposition and our long-term potential. We'll continue advancing positive steps to strengthen our sales performance and returns in this business. Let's turn to Slide 8 for a more detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow. Slide 8 summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. We continue to drive strong cash flow performance through a disciplined approach. Total capital spending was up $174 million for the first nine months of 2010, including $7 million for real estate. We remain focused on driving efficiencies in our capital spending while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long-term return improvement. As a result of higher operating profits and lower capital expenditures, free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $260 million for the first nine months of the year, a 12% increase over the same prior-year period. We remain solidly on track for record performance in both capital efficiency and free cash flow. For 2010, we're increasing our expectations for free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to approximately $350 million to $380 million. This reflects a strong year-to-date performance, expected benefits from recently enacted U.S. tax legislation, and updated projections for capital spending in the $270 million range. Our strong operating cash flow allows us to invest towards long-term growth in our business while also supporting shareholder payouts. In the third quarter, we acquired 1.8 million shares of our stock for approximately $40 million. As of September 30, we have acquired 4 million shares for approximately $95 million year-to-date. As we announced at Investor Day earlier this month, our Board recently approved a $200 million increase to our existing share repurchase program. This authorization is in addition to the $150 million authorization announced earlier this year, which as of September 30 had approximately $55 million remaining. This leaves us a balance of $255 million for additional share repurchases. Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a review of our key debt statistics. Our strong financial performance and focus on cash management continues to strengthen our balance sheet. Our debt portfolio at September 30, 2010, remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate is 6.9%, and we're 87% fixed. Maturity is 7.1 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. Our consolidated leverage ratio decreased to 3.0x. Currently, our consolidated leverage ratio is at the low end of what we feel is a very manageable 3x to 4x leverage level for our company. During the quarter, we used excess cash to fund a $200 million partial redemption of our 7 3/4% senior subordinated notes due in 2015. This transaction reduces our annual interest expense by about $16 million. We're also well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. Liquidity is more than $945 million, with $184 million in cash and $762 million in additional borrowing capacity as of quarter end. This concludes our review of the Q3 2010 results. While the digital asset impairment impacted our reported profit results, our underlying operating profit and cash flow performance remains strong commercial, reflecting our disciplined management approach and strong business foundation. Let's now to turn to Slide 10 to discuss our financial outlook. Slide 10 summarizes our full year 2010 and Q4 guidance. We remain on track for strong financial performance this year. For 2010, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3,120,000,000 to $3,140,000,000, at the lower end of our guidance range. This represents reported revenue growth of about 4% including internal revenue growth of between 2% and 3%, and 1% to 1.5% of combined acquisition growth and FX benefit. We're increasing our profit outlook reflecting productivity gains, controlled spending and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. We expect adjusted OIBDA of $940 million to $955 million up 8% to 10% versus prior year. Adjusted EPS is now projected in the $1.12 to $1.16 range or growth of 14% to 19%. As noted, we're increasing our free cash flow outlook to $350 million to $380 million, reflecting the flow-through of strong operating performance, expected benefits from recent tax legislation and projections for capital expenditures of about $270 million for the year. The capital outlook includes about $15 million for real estate. As noted earlier, the digital asset impairment has no impact on revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS or free cash flow. For Q4, we're projecting revenue of $780 million to $800 million and adjusted OIBDA in the $233 million to $248 million range. Thanks, and now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert Brennan: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter was another quarter of solid operating performance for Iron Mountain as we benefited from our strong business foundation, combined with our commitment to operational excellence and global service expansion. I'll discuss this more fully later in my remarks, but I want you to know that we're taking proactive steps to address the challenges currently facing our Digital business and get it back on track. This ongoing review has resulted in a $255 million impairment charge that Brian described in his comments. First, I will briefly review our current business performance and talk about what we're doing to continue delivering solid financial results. I also want to reinforce the key messages delivered at our recent Investor Day held earlier in the month, specifically, that we have a strong sustainable business foundation, that we continue to deliver excellent financial performance and improved returns, that we're focused on improving our growth trajectory to targeted strategies and that we intend to create long-term value as a leading information management services company. Let's first discuss our Q3 results and current business trends. As we discussed at Investor Day, we continue to work through the challenges of a tough economy that are moderating our revenue growth. As recently as 2008, our internal growth rate was 8%. Since that time, we've moderated to the 2% to 3% range where we are currently. Most important change in our growth rate is the decrease in core service activity levels driven by the economy. In Q3, we saw continued pressure on these core service activities, reflecting impacts from high unemployment, excess office space and generally lower levels of spending. We've also seen moderating in storage revenue growth. Trends have been stabilizing on this front, and in Q3, Records Management volumes globally were up about 1%. This is down slightly from Q2 growth as a solid international growth and momentum in new sales were offset by sustained higher North American destruction and withdrawal levels. As expected, we've also seen some moderation in average net price gains in our North American Records Management business, from the 3% range to the 2% range, reflecting business mix impact and effects from currently low inflation. In other areas such as state balding, we've seen impact from episodic customer reductions and container storage, which constrained gains in the quarter. Again, we see these impact as primarily economic in nature, and our current outlook incorporates our expectation for the continued effects from these type of factors until we see a clearer sign of improvement in economic conditions. Despite these impacts, we're driving positive revenue gains, and we continue to advance our long-term growth agenda. International growth remains solid with sustained 6% growth in Storage revenues and strong performance in the expansion markets. For example, in Spain, we managed active medical records at hospital groups [indiscernible] and expand our services to other hospitals in that group during 2011. In Germany, we added Santander Bank to our listed new Records Management customers. And in the Czech Republic, we've added recurring storage and service revenues at OBI. We continue to drive new sales initiatives to strengthen our North American core volume growth. During the quarter at Target, we added secure shredding to the hard copy and tape vaulting services we've been providing to them for the past decade. At Exelon, we've added records management data protection and secure shredding to an existing vital records program. And at Chan Hospital [ph], we added release of information, shredding services and special project work to their existing Records Management program. And as I mentioned at Investor Day, we added FedEx as a new customer where we've really been deploying a comprehensive shredding solution to 1,800 retail locations in one month's time. We also continue to build momentum in our hybrid services, with double-digit gains that help support strong complementary service revenue growth during the quarter. In just a couple weeks' time, we closed a $500,000 litigation support project with a leading sports retailer, and as in most hybrid projects, this will likely lead to additional work. We're also making progress in developing technology services as part of an integrated value proposition. Under Harry Ebbighausen's leadership, we're advancing tighter integration of our Digital services into Iron Mountain's core operations to accelerate revenue growth and capture cost efficiencies. While areas such as eDiscovery remain constrained by legal cost pressures, we continue to make solid progress expanding our industry-leading PC backup and e-mail archival solutions. During the quarter, we closed a substantial PC backup and e-mail archiving management deal with Varian Semiconductor and several deals closed with our Mimosa acquisition as a result of an integrated value proposition, including sales with Select Medical, Yuri Insurance [ph] and Sears. We're also refining our product strategy by divesting nonstrategic offerings such as our Data Domain business, which we sold during the quarter. As I noted at Investor Day, our Digital business is facing some important challenges and has been impacted recently by execution that's below our high standards, a tough economy, and shortfalls in the eDiscovery business, significant shortfalls. We're being proactive to address these challenges in our Digital business. I've made significant leadership changes, we're strengthening the points of integration with our core business, and we're more sharply focused on advancing the growth of our industry-leading services through our enterprise sales force. Now as part of this ongoing review, we look closely at the carrying value of the business and determined that a reduced value is more appropriate under the current circumstance. This resulted in the $255 million impairment charge that Brian described. I want you to know that technology services remain an important part of an integrated value proposition at Iron Mountain, and I want you to remember that we have leading businesses in PC backup, in intellectual property management, in e-mail archiving, and that we're taking steps to improve our execution in this business and get it back towards higher growth and profitability. So while we aggressively meet these challenges, we're faced with and we meet them head-on, we also continued to deliver strong financial results, driven by our focus on operational excellence and global service expansion. We continue to drive higher profits and improved capital efficiency, and this has led to significant increases in our free cash flow and a strength in balance sheet. So let me sum up Q3. We continue to deliver solid positive revenue gains. We translated these gains into strong profit and cash results that are keeping us on track towards strong full year operating performance. And we're confident in our ability to address these opportunities that are within our control while we deliver strong profitability and cash flow performance. As we work through the immediate-term environment, we remain highly energized by the tremendous potential for Iron Mountain over the long term as we pursue the strategy I outlined for you at Investor Day. As we discussed at Investor Day, our primary goal is to bridge towards higher revenue growth by pursuing three areas: First, strengthening our go-to-market effectiveness where we're taking a very targeted, low-risk approach to improving our sales capability. Second, through international expansion, where the international markets are inherently attractive to us as a selling platform and where we have a proven approach. And third, through the expansion of new services in both the digital and hybrid markets, we're leveraging the power of Iron Mountain to capture significant long-term growth opportunities in large, fast-growing markets. So it's go-to-market, international expansion and the development of new services. That's our agenda, and we'll pursue this agenda within the context of delivering strong financial performance and improved returns as we continue to focus on operational excellence. We're on track towards delivering 8% to 10% adjusted OIBDA growth and record cash flows in 2010. This builds on the strong record of performance we've achieved over the past four years. It reflects the strength of our underlying business and the capability and discipline of our team. We look forward to reporting on our continued process in developing the potential and power of Iron Mountain. Thanks. Now we'd like to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Could you discuss current trends in destruction activity levels? Any change so far in the fourth quarter, and what's the immediate outlook? Do you expect activity to remain somewhat elevated through year end?
Brian McKeon: The trends in the quarter were relatively similar. We saw in North America continued higher outgoing volume in total. We saw some increase in permanent withdrawals. The overall volume growth in Records Management in North America was relatively flat. That offsets some progress we're making on the new sales front and solid gains in international. On balance, the Records Management volume trends were relatively similar, and that's what we're projecting in the near term. Obviously, we are advancing the new sales initiatives that we expect to have -- I think we're going to benefit -- benefit for us as we go into 2011.
Robert Brennan: The sales performance, Vance, remained strong.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: And similarly, the gains in backup and archiving services that you noted, did that momentum continue into the fourth quarter?
Robert Brennan: We're not reporting on the fourth quarter today, but we have had solid gains in backup and archiving services. And that has offset the pressure that we highlighted in areas like eDiscovery and the Digital business.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Just wondering about the pricing trends for eDiscovery. The volumes are understandably weak, but what's the competitive environment like and how is that affecting pricing?
Robert Brennan: So pricing is the key contributor here, Vance. The price per gigabyte and price per matter has come down. And essentially, because of the secular pressure on the legal sector, they're trying to call the amount of data they review. So it is a significant price drop that's driving a lot of the pressures that we noted and a central part of the reason behind the impairment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I heard you just mentioned permanent withdrawals in the context of a continued higher outgoing volumes. Just to be clear, is that a competitive dynamic or is this kind of an internal customer dynamic when we're talking higher outgoing volume levels? Is this something that you highlight against new or the same as what you've been saying?
Robert Brennan: More similar, Andrew, it does vary quarter-to-quarter. And the biggest competitor for us remains people doing this in-house, Andrew. And that's fundamentally when it comes to outgoing volumes or the fact that we can't get -- it takes longer to move somebody, and it's a function of them doing it themselves, generally speaking, versus that of a particular competitor.
Brian McKeon: We do track this and that's what we hear back from customers, is the larger factor on the permanent withdrawal front is people deciding to bring it in-house. There are competitive dynamics. It's, again, more similar than different. We do see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. I think the key thing to hear is it's remained high in North America and on balance -- and in international markets, where we're seeing positive trends. So net-net, it's similar trends, more similar than different, but we continue to see a relatively higher level of outgoing volume, which is constraining overall volume growth.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just to square the point away, when you say in-housing or competition versus in-house, you mean, on the kind of a partial basis? You don't mean that there's customers actually changing their minds of using an outside vendor?
Robert Brennan: No, yes. So this is very much on the margin. We track it pretty granularly by region, by reason. If you zoom way out, it's essentially very similar as Brian said. But no, we don't see -- I don't know of any customer that's decided to move everything that was outsourced to an in-source basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Gold of Sidoti.
David Gold - Sidoti & Company, LLC: I wanted to get a little bit more color on the issues, particularly in the eDiscovery side. A couple of things, one, the pricing drop that you're pointing to, especially now, it's been going on for a long time, but is there something that happened recently? Has there been a large drop of late? I'm just trying to get a sense for basically what the catalyst was for reviewing, let's say, right now and making the decision for the write-down?
Brian McKeon: Let's look at it from a market perspective. Fundamentally, the law firms are getting squeezed very hard by their corporate customers to lower their prices, and that leads to a trend towards legal process outsourcing. There are also -- in the attempt to lower cost, they're trying to do a lot of the calling of data themselves, which means smaller matters. And the price per gigabyte has dropped precipitously over the last year, and that's what's driving this from a market perspective. Customers are just not willing to pay what they were paying for their law firms. The law firms are not willing to incur the cost associated with eDiscovery, and they're trying to drive down the size of the matter. Our cost to serve remains high even though the size of the matter is lower. So what you should hear from that is that our -- a goal of ours is to drive down the cost of offering that service, and that's something we're getting on.
Robert Brennan: And just in terms -- the second part of your question, as we've been highlighting, we've been proactively working on a number of fronts and improving performance in the Digital business. I'm looking at this in more detail. We've very recently had a change in leadership. We've highlighted the pressures in areas like eDiscovery. We've made a decision to divest a part of the business, recently the Domain Name business. And that led us to accelerate looking at the carrying values and to assess the carrying value of the goodwill. And we decided to take that step and to record the impairment this quarter, and it's part of this overall proactive effort we're taking to get the business on track.
Brian McKeon: And David, what we want you to hear is that it's taking longer than originally anticipated to build scale. But fundamentally, we have strong services that we're focused on improving our performance.
David Gold - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Part two of that, if I can add. I guess many of the competitors that we've seen have developed new products in the last few months in order to do something called quick calling, basically to reduce the cost of the servicing there. And then I guess, just out of curiosity, are you guys similarly develop -- it sounds like this may force you to develop a product similar to that, or purchase something?
Brian McKeon: Well, no. We have it. We've developed it internally. It's called eVantage, it's an early case assessment tool. It's just getting to the market now, so it's not offsetting the pressures that we've described, but it's a lower cost alternative so that the law firms can do their calling on premise earlier in the cycle. So we're very much on that. It's internally developed and it doesn't represent an area that we have to fill in, either organically or inorganically.
David Gold - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Incentive comp, can you give a sense for how much the pullback helped in the quarter?
Robert Brennan: We did quantify that, so it was about five points of the OIBDA growth, which was I believe, that's $12 million year-on-year. Keep in mind that a fair amount of that is we're catching up, if you will, for a year-to-date accruals and reflecting our most recent views. As we highlighted at Investor Day, David, we're having low incentive compensation payouts this year for the full year. It'll probably at about three points to our growth rate and in terms of our forecast. And as we look forward to next year, we'll plan for normal accruals and that is -- on a comparison basis, it will provide a drag to our OIBDA growth rate. But we are not achieving our revenue growth goals this year, and it's been -- areas like service trends that have been a real challenge for us. And that's being reflected in low incentive compensation payouts this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of Barclays Capital.
Gary Bisbee - Barclays Capital: I guess the question is how often do you think that purchasing manager for the Digital services would be the same as the historical person you've had a relationship with for Physical, and to the extent that it does happen for a lot of these, maybe others than the hybrid that you talked about at the Investor Day to be somewhere in the IT department, how do you improve your performance there based on what I assume is developing a totally separate relationship.
Robert Brennan: Gary, it's really the synergies between our Data Protection business and our Digital business call the same decision-making stack within IT. And that's where we're combining our sales forces between Digital and Data Protection and really affecting what is the same decision-making stack. The folks who do tape vaulting are the same folks in the same position area that drive decisions around archival, around data protection, around data recovery. So that's where synergy exists. The key areas of synergy, if you look at records management, shredding, those are very synergistic calling under the same decision areas. Data protection and Digital, very synergistic. Where we sell across the product line is in the enterprise accounts and then in the smallest accounts.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Mirshekari of Fidelity.
John Mirshekari: What kind of opportunities do you guys have to refinance your debt given how low interest rates are currently?
Brian McKeon: We have been taking steps last year. We did a major refinancing of a new bond issuance and achieved a longer term on high-yield bonds and achieved some efficiency there. We've done some paydowns. We have within our longer-term bonds, obviously, prepayment costs associated with some of the longer maturities. And we basically paid down the things that makes sense to pay down in the current environment. As noted, we don't have anything really coming up soon. And we have some British pound based bonds that make sense for to -- that have a low interest rate, make sense for us to retain from a hedging point of view. So we look at that all the time and it's -- we evaluate that and we've been paying down everything or refinancing the things that make sense.
John Mirshekari: With interest rates lower now than a year ago, do you think you have room to bring down the average cost of debt which is 6.9?%
Robert Brennan: Well, I think in terms of -- we could look at areas in terms of and fixed and floating mix over time, and that could help us. And that's something that we're evaluating. We're relatively fixed right now. And that I think would be probably the primary area that we could achieve some efficiencies.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Could you just -- I guess discussing in the core storage verticals and end customers that you serve and industries, trends that you're seeing amongst your largest ones?
Robert Brennan: So from a vertical perspective, Scott, healthcare is doing very well. Legal faces the same pressures that really across their business that we have highlighted in eDiscovery. Financial Services remains our strongest segment and an area where we continue to drive more and more vital importance into that business. We're seeing very strong growth from a hybrid perspective in our core business and good progress on the Digital front as well. So vertically, Financial Services remains number one. Healthcare is moving along well. Legal is under pressure but nothing more to report really.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Could you just give us an update on the Mimosa integration and also customers' reception to that integrated offering?
Robert Brennan: We actually just announced this week a suite offerings with Mimosa. I'm very pleased with the quality of the product, and we're beginning to receive accolades from the analyst community as it relates to near points, mimosa's near point solution and the fact that it is further out in front of the competition in terms of market capability. From a selling trajectory, I've mentioned Sears and Varian Semiconductor in my remarks. We're starting to bring down some big names. The fact is that it's a product that many of our customers need. I'm pleased with the asset. The integration of the team is going well. T.M. Ravi is in a senior marketing role for us. We've got a good part of that team that's firmly embedded in our Digital business. So I feel very good about that potential of that acquisition.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Should we anticipate in the near term additional divestitures? Just thoughts on will there be similar calling with regard to you looking internally at some of your business units?
Robert Brennan: We're constantly looking at our business and understanding what's core and what's context. It resulted in the sale of the Data Domain Name business where it just rally wasn't core from the standpoint of our customers' needs. And that resulted in the divestiture. At this point, we feel we've got the right asset base and to focus on making sure that we drive results from that asset base.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: I'm wondering if you could just walk through the free cash flow, which was really good, particularly the full year guidance? If I did it right, it looks like the year-to-date CapEx is $174 million, but the full year is about $270 million. Is it going to be a $100 million spike in the fourth quarter? And if so, what does that relate to?
Robert Brennan: There will be higher spending in the fourth quarter, and that's typical for the business. We tend to have a number of our capacity expansion projects that are planned earlier in the year and executed later in the year. And so, if you look back in time, Kevin, we've had a pretty typical pattern of heavier spending later in the year, just in terms of how we plan the capacity additions within the Physical business. That's the key driver.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: And then, just -- I know you're kind of pretty mad, and any the initial thoughts on 2011 relative to the analyst day? Are we still pretty much in line with where we're firming up?
Robert Brennan: I'm glad you asked. What we have is we put out preliminary numbers in terms of growth rates and outlook. Our outlook for revenue growth and adjusted OIBDA growth are on track for what we had talked about, and the 2% to 4% growth in revenue and the 0% to 3% in adjusted OIBDA. Again, just want to reinforce that some of that, the adjusted OIBDA we are working through the lapping on the incentive compensation issues, so that's an underlying growth of 3% to 6% on an operating basis. We'll work through refining areas like free cash flow and EPS, but we're on track towards what we had talked about, no changes to note today.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Real quick, Brian, if you could, I know you kind of talked about incremental spend at Mimosa, some targeted growth initiatives and then a pickup on the comp accrual. Do you have any sense to what the net impact overall was to SG&A for most period items?
Brian McKeon: We did highlight the incentive comp piece. I'm sorry, the other pieces you'd mentioned were...
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: I thought that there was some incremental spend from Mimosa and then some targeted growth initiatives as well?
Robert Brennan: I don't have that right in front of me on the Mimosa incremented. I apologize, Kevin, I don't want to ask any number without having them right in front of me.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Okay. We'll get it later.
Robert Brennan: All right. Those are the questions in the queue. We very much appreciate your attention this morning. We also appreciate those of you who attended Investor Day a few weeks back. Again, driving our- the fact that we have a strong sustainable business foundation continued to drive solid performance. We are very much focused on improving growth and are mindful of why we're here, which is to create long-term value. We appreciate your support. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2010 Q2  (2010-07-30 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Brian McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Executive Vice President Robert Brennan - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Stephen Golden - Vice President of Investor Relations
Analysts: Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co Phil Stiller - Citigroup Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research
Operator: Good morning. My name is Bonnie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Second Quarter Earnings Webcast Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen Golden, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Golden: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our 2010 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. After my announcement this morning, Brian McKeon will review our financial results, followed by Bob Brennan's CEO remarks. When Bob is finished with his comments, we'll open up the phones for Q&A.  Per our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations Page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2010 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements.  As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release. With that, I'd like to introduce our CFO, Brian McKeon.
Brian McKeon: Thanks, Stephen. Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. We continued to drive strong financial performance in the second quarter. Adjusted OIBDA came in above the high end of our guidance range, driven by strong cost management and benefits from productivity initiatives that supported better-than-expected gross margin gains. Adjusted OIBDA increased 8% percent in Q2 and 10% year-to-date versus the prior year, and is on track towards our full-year growth targets.  Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 per share, an increase of 13% compared to the same period last year. Our reported EPS was $0.20 per share including one-time impacts on other expense and our effective tax rate related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar within the quarter.  Revenue growth for the quarter was 5%, aided by favorable year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Internal growth was 2% with consistent trends in core revenue growth. Revenue gains continue to be moderated by economic trends, which have pressured core service activity and storage growth. FX revenue benefits for the quarter were also about $9 million less than originally forecast given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Looking forward. We're maintaining our outlook for strong adjusted OIBDA growth this year, consistent with our prior guidance. We are adjusting our full-year revenue outlook to reflect recent changes in FX rates and consistent internal growth trends, which are below our original goals for improved 4% to 6% internal growth this year.  Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin our review of the second quarter results.  Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the second quarter of 2009. As noted, Q2 was another strong quarter for financial performance. Enterprise revenue growth was a solid 5%, supported by favorable year-on-year currency rate changes.  From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 3% internal growth, supported by 3% storage internal growth and strong complementary service revenue performance, including benefits from higher paper prices and DMS revenues. Overall gains continue to be constrained by economic trends contributing to soft core service activity levels.  Our International Physical segment reported 2% internal growth, supported by solid 6% growth in storage revenues. These gains were moderated by tough comparisons to prior-year project revenues.  In our Digital segment, reported revenue growth was 5% in the second quarter, including benefits from the Mimosa acquisition we completed at the end of February. Internal growth for the segment was minus 1%, reflecting the impacts of lower subscription sales in 2009 and moderated growth in eDiscovery consistent with broader market trends. Our positive momentum on the new sales front, as illustrated by our stronger license sales, supported our Q2 Digital results. We continue to translate moderate overall revenue growth into strong gross profit gains. Gross profits increased 9% versus the prior year, reflecting a 230 basis point in margin improvement. Continued benefits from productivity initiatives and disciplined cost controls are supporting these gains and driving higher service margins. Storage gross margins also improved, aided by pricing gains.  Adjusted OIBDA grew 8% to $236 million. This increase was driven by gross profit gains and lower incentive compensation expense, offset by Mimosa integration costs and investments in growth initiatives including the development of our international Hybrid Records business.  Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $75 million and amortization was $10 million in line with our forecast. Other expense for the quarter was $4 million primarily related to foreign currency rate changes.  Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 per share, an increase of 13% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong operating performance combined with relatively flat interest expense. Reported EPS in Q2 of 2010 and Q2 of 2009 were impacted by discrete effects related to FX rate changes.  Reported EPS for the second quarter was $0.20 per share. The reported earnings were impacted by a higher effective tax rate reflecting the impact of discreet items which more than offset higher operating income. The structural tax rate for the second quarter was 39%. The impact of discrete tax items, primarily related to foreign currency rate changes in the quarter, added 15 points to the effective tax rate.  Reported EPS for Q2 of 2009 was $0.43 including the benefits of $18 million of other income and a 14% effective tax rate due to FX rate changes in that quarter. We expect the structural tax rate for 2010 to be 39%.  Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange compared to our 2010 full-year target growth ranges. Total internal growth for the quarter was 2% reflecting consistent core revenue growth trends. Economic factors continue to constrain service activity levels and storage growth. Core activity correlates with employment and general economic trends and has remained soft in recent quarters. We've seen significant pressure in vertical segments such as Legal Services, which have been particularly hard hit during this downturn. The internal growth rate for core storage revenues continues to trend at 3%. While we're making positive progress on the new sales front, overall volume gains continue to be constrained by softness in general business activity and sustained higher levels of destructions.  We're seeing some moderation in net pricing benefit in areas like U.S. box storage as well, towards the 2% range, due primarily to business mix and lower CPI levels. Revenue gains in International Physical and Digital remain primarily volume driven.  Core service internal growth was down 1% in the second quarter, consistent with recent trends. Growth in our complementary services revenues, which face a difficult comparison to Q2 of 2009, was supported by higher recycled paper prices and strong gains in growth areas such as DMS. We continue to see benefits from our focus on expanding our hybrids records management services, and Bob will have more to say on this shortly.  Overall, while core growth trends remain consistent, and we're building momentum and strengthening new sales and growing a hybrid records services, we are trending below our goals for improved 4% to 6% revenue growth this year. These consistent trends will be reflected in our updated full-year outlook, which I'll discuss more fully later in the presentation. Foreign exchange increased reported revenue growth by 2% in the quarter, reflecting the year-over-year weakening of the U.S. dollar. At recent exchange rates, we expect the FX impact on revenue growth to be about minus 1% for the second half of the year. The Mimosa acquisition added under 1% to our reported revenue growth in the quarter.   Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our year-to-date performance. Slide 6 looks at our year-to-date operating performance compared to the first half of 2009. The key take-away from this slide is that, despite the ongoing economic factors that are moderating top line growth, we continue to drive very strong financial results. Our continued focus on operational improvement is driving substantial gains in gross profits, leading to a 220 basis point increase in gross margin for the first half of 2010 compared to the same prior-year period. These improvements are sustainable and position us well for flow-through benefits from higher growth when economic conditions improve.  For the first half of the year, we achieved 10% growth in adjusted OIBDA. Strong operating gains, combined with a relatively flat interest expense, drove a 16% increase in adjusted EPS compared to the first half of 2009. Our focus on disciplined capital allocation continues to drive improvement to our capital efficiency. Combined with operating profit gains, this progress drove a 17% increase in year-to-date free cash flow compared to the same prior-year period. Let's move now to Slide 7 for a year-to-date review from a segment perspective.  Slide 7 shows key metrics for each of our four segments compared to the first half of 2009. Our year-to-date financial results reflect solid execution across our business. North America, our largest segment, continues to drive higher profits, cash flows and returns. We continue to push our optimization agenda while expanding our business foundation through a targeted growth strategy. Significant growth opportunities exist in the unvended storage and DMS markets for this segment, and we're making solid progress in advancing our growth strategies on these fronts.  Our focus on operational excellence will allow us to build on the very attractive economics of this business as we continue to expand. Our International segment also continues to expand and is well positioned to continue delivering strong profit gains. Internal storage growth is 6% year-to-date in this segment, supported by gains in expansion markets. While year-to-date revenue and profit growth have been constrained by some tough comparisons and early investments in expanding our Hybrids Records business, we remain on track for solid profit and margin improvement in our International business this year.  Our Digital business continues to work through economic impact that have pressured subscription revenues in recent quarters, as well as impacts from cost pressures in the Legal segment, which have contributed to a softer eDiscovery market. Integration costs associated with the Mimosa acquisition are reflected in the year-to-date profit results of the segment. Bob will discuss in more detail the progress we're making in advancing our new sales and product initiatives to position us for strong long-term growth in Digital.  Let's now turn to Slide 8 for more a detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow. Slide 8 summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. Total capital spending was $107 million for the first half of 2010 including $4 million for real estate. We remain focused on driving efficiencies in our capital spending while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long-term return improvement. For the first half of 2010, free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $141 million, a 17% increase over the same prior-year period. The year-on-year increase in free cash flow was a result of higher operating profits in 2010 compared to 2009. Included in the $141 million of free cash flow is $8 million of net insurance proceeds associated with the Chilean earthquake.  For 2010, we're revising our expectations for free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to approximately $330 million to $360 million. This reflects estimates for higher cash taxes, which are offsetting additional capital efficiencies. As we announced in our Q4 earnings call in February, our board approved a $150 million share repurchase program. In the second quarter, we acquired 1.8 million shares for approximately $44 million. Combined with our first quarter purchases, we've acquired 2.2 million shares for approximately $54 million year-to-date. This leaves us a balance of $96 million for additional share repurchases under the existing plan.  Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a review of our key debt statistics. Our strong financial performance and disciplined cash management has resulted in a very healthy balance sheet. Our debt portfolio at June 30, 2010 remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate is 6.9%, and we're 87% fixed. Maturity is 7.5 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. Consolidated leverage is at 3.1x, benefiting from our significant operating cash flows while reflecting the $112 million we paid for the acquisition of Mimosa in Q1. Leverage is just below the low end of our target range of 3.5x to 4.5x, and we're comfortable operating at this level given the current economic environment. We're also well-positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. Liquidity is nearly $1.1 billion, with $340 million in cash and $750 million in additional borrowing capacity as of quarter end.  This concludes our review of the Q2 2010 results. In summary, we continue to drive strong financial performance despite the economic impacts moderating revenue growth. And we remain committed to strengthening our business foundation globally while delivering strong financial performance to position the company to capture increased benefits when economic conditions improve. Let's now turn to Slide 10 to discuss our financial outlook.  Slide 10 highlights the key factors impacting our revised outlook for the balance of the year. As noted, we remain on track for strong financial performance in 2010. We are updating our revenue outlook today to reflect recent changes in FX rates and ongoing pressures on general business activity. Our current outlook is for 4% to 5% reported revenue growth this year, down from our prior goals for 6% to 8% growth improvement this year. The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar has reduced our full-year growth outlook by nearly 1%. We've also adjusted our full-year internal growth forecast of the 3% range, incorporating year-to-date trends and expectations for continued soft economic conditions.  While we are seeing signs of improvement in complementary services, and we continue to make progress in strengthening our sales pipeline, economic trends are limiting core revenue growth. Our outlook reflects projections for full-year storage growth in the 3% range, consistent with recent trends, and for flat to modest growth in core service revenues. While macro factors continue to constrain our revenue growth outlook, our progress in driving operational excellence across our business and improving our international profit trajectory is keeping us on track for significant profit gains this year. This progress enables us to maintain our outlook for 7% to 11% adjusted OIBDA growth, double-digit adjusted EPS gains and strong free cash flow in 2010.  Let's now turn to Slide 11 to review specifics related to our 2010 guidance. Slide 11 summarizes our full year 2010 and Q3 guidance. For 2010, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.16 billion. This represents reported revenue growth of between 4% and 5%, including internal revenue growth of approximately 3%, and 1% to 1.5% of combined acquisition and growth in FX benefit based on recent foreign currency exchange rates. Our profit outlook remains strong, with expectations for 7% to 11% growth in adjusted OIBDA and 10% to 20% gains in adjusted EPS. Our adjusted OIBDA at outlook remains at the midpoint of $945 million, as productivity gains and benefits from cost management initiatives and lower incentive compensation accruals offset negative impacts from factors such as FX.  We're lowering our expected capital expenditures for the year to approximately $280 million, reflecting refined spending plans. Included in our capital expenditures is $20 million for real estate. As noted, we're adjusting our free cash flow outlook to $330 million to $360 million, reflecting a higher outlook for cash taxes.  For Q3, we're projecting revenue of $780 million to $800 million, reflecting internal growth of 3% to 4%, supported by approximately 2% core revenue growth and improved complementary revenue gains. We expect Q3 adjusted OIBDA in the $236 million to $246 million range. Let's turn to Slide 12 to put this performance in a longer-term context. Slide 12 demonstrates the long-term record of strong financial performance we're building at Iron Mountain. Over the past four years, we've been executing consistently against key financial objectives for our company: to drive consistently strong revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth; improve capital efficiency to support higher incremental return on invested capital; and to advanced strategies to optimize our capital structure, drive cash flow and maximize investor returns.  While the impacts of the economic slowdown have pushed our recent top line performance below our long-term goals, we continue to execute with discipline to deliver strong financial performance. Over the past four years, while continue to expand our business foundation and capability, we've driven consistently strong adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS growth well ahead of revenue gains.  Our disciplined approach to capital allocation has supported a 500-plus basis point improvement in capital efficiency, record cash flow generation and the substantial strengthening of our balance sheet.  These improvements are sustainable, and reflect the strength of our business model and our growing capability as an organization. These factors will enable us to deliver continued strong performance and position us well to realize the benefits of strong incremental profit and cash flow from future revenue growth as the economy improves.  Thank you. I'd like to now turn the call over to Bob.
Robert Brennan: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As Brian mentioned, we delivered strong financial results in Q2 with adjusted OIBDA results exceeding the high end of our expectations. And we continue to deliver strong performance despite economic factors that are moderating our revenue growth. Today, I'm going to discuss how our business is doing in the current environment, such that we continued to deliver positive financial performance and position ourselves well for when the economy recovers. I'm also going to provide an update on our growth agenda, highlighting the progress we're making in key areas such as hybrid service expansion and go-to-market strength, as these are fundamental enablers of our long-term success. There are some key messages that I want to emphasize today. First, Iron Mountain's business continues to deliver strong financial results despite consistent macro impacts that are moderating our revenue growth. Second, we're making good progress on our growth agenda, positioning ourselves for strong long-term performance by focusing on areas we can control.  Let's talk about our financial performance in Q2. We continue to demonstrate the attractiveness of the Iron Mountain business model as reflected in today's results. And as Brian pointed out at the close of his remarks, profitability and cash flow are all up significantly in the past four years. This performance is the direct result of our base business model, as well as our determination to implement operational excellence and process discipline across our company. We continue to strengthen the management of pricing, transportation, workflow in our record centers and the way we procure services. These actions support strong gross margin gains, and as you know, we're extending this capability globally, which along with our growth initiatives will help grow our international returns. We believe that being able to continue delivering strong financial performance will serve us well as we make progress with our growth agenda, and it'll also position Iron Mountain to take advantage of the economy as it improves.  So let me talk now about the current trends and how we're managing them. In terms of Core business trends, we're experiencing the same softness that many of our customers are. Specifically, core service activity levels are down. This correlates with continued high unemployment in our customer base and the general sluggish business environment. Certain segments, like Legal, are seeing significant pressure in terms of their cost and litigation activity. This puts pressure on our services in that segment. The continued economic weakness has also constrained storage volume gains in developed markets like North America and the UK. Customers are focused on cost controls, which leads to sharp control over their inventories. Now we see these trends as principally related to the soft economy, and until we see evidence to the contrary, we're planning for these trends to continue and have updated our growth outlook accordingly.  We know our business is a great business and has great potential, and we'll continue to manage through this impacts and deliver strong financial results. We intend to grow profits faster than revenue, translating mid-single digit revenue growth into strong adjusted OIBDA, earnings per share and cash flow gains. We continue to focus on those things that are within our control to improve our growth rate and position ourselves to take advantage of any recovery that occurs in the economy. So let me talk about Iron Mountain's growth.   I'm pleased with the progress we're making on our growth agenda because, as you know, our customers need to reduce their costs and risks, know what information they have, manage it appropriately, realize greater value from their information and have confidence that it is guarded safely. That's Iron Mountain's value proposition, and we're excited about the traction we're getting with more and more customers. And because we've built a business that runs effectively, we can focus on our customers' critical information needs as they evolve.  In terms of core growth, we continue to make good strides globally, with solid 6% storage internal growth internationally in Q2, supported by continued growth in expansion markets like Continental Europe, Latin America and Australia. And having established a foundation and a culture of operational excellence in North America, we're now in a position to really aggressively pursue revenue. And I'm confident that we'll be equally successful in this endeavor as we were in establishing operational excellence. We've made steady progress in building the sales pipeline this year, and I'm pleased with our new sales performance. To give you a better sense for this momentum, let me highlight some of the deals that we won in our Core business during the quarter.  Berkshire Hathaway awarded us preferred vendor status, meaning they recommend Iron Mountain records management to all of their operating units. This is a relationship we've been cultivating for some time, where we advised Berkshire Hathaway to consolidate their efforts and where we won their business over time. Also during the quarter, one of the largest commercial real estate companies in the world signed a master agreement to bring Iron Mountain's records management, shredding and data protection capabilities downstream to their tenants on a worldwide basis. One of the world's leading professional services firms signed a ten-year contract with us to outsource all of their records management program in the Netherlands. And with this win, we now serve all of the big four accounting firms in that region.   During the quarter, two of the leading pharmaceutical companies and the largest tax advisory firm in the world awarded us their Shredding business. As you know, this is a competitive business. However, the competition for shredding gets a lot easier for Iron Mountain when we're dealing with large firms that have multiple locations where they're demanding an unbroken chain of custody, operational uniformity and certifiable destruction of their information. And as you might imagine, you can't risk destroying the wrong tax return or lab notebook.  Iron Mountain remains very well positioned to capture these clients as we deploy the right capabilities and have the scale necessary to service their needs.  Also in our Core business is our Hybrid business, which you've heard me refer to as DMS, where there are both physical and digital properties to protecting the asset. But this also involves the capability of converting from physical to digital, where we have a unique value proposition. Hybrid services support our complementary revenue growth, and I'm quite pleased with our progress during the quarter. During the quarter, we won CitiFinancial, where we're working with them on a project where we get their records from 1,800 branches and move them to our storage and from there, we will then image the loans for their -- for Citi's review. One of the largest technology companies in the world chose Iron Mountain to replace their existing partner for imaging services into their customer base with our DMS capability. This a very big competitive victory for us, and it reinforces our credibility as best in class.   During the quarter, a major government agency co-awarded us a project to retrieve, organize and transport records from hundreds of banks around the country and image those documents at our imaging centers for the purpose of long-term preservation. And also during the quarter in our core, a major Hollywood studio chose us to transcribe their vial [ph] (27:45) film and sound assets throughout the continent of Europe. I highlight these wins because they're all expected to scale meaningfully, and there are common requirements around winning them which are unique to our value proposition. And an unbroken chain of custody around physical assets, the facilities and the people to convert those assets and the ability to store them digitally so that our customers can take action on the information.  These wins reinforce our momentum in the marketplace, demonstrating the linkage between our businesses, and underscore our value proposition, reminding us that we're on the right track strategically, and that we continue to earn the confidence of some of the premiere names in business as we refine our offerings into the marketplace.  Let me talk about the Digital business. Our current growth in digital is constrained by softer subscription sales in the past few quarters and recent pressure on eDiscovery. We are taking action to address these issues and are positioning ourselves for long-term success in this business. We've significantly increased the capability of our technology services, having recently increased the amount of data that can be handled in our server protection product, added discovery capability to our PC protection product and successfully integrated the business of our Mimosa acquisition within the first 100 days they were in Iron Mountain. We've won several technology service deals during the quarter, including an agreement with Hitachi Densa to resell our server protection in Japan. One of the world's largest energy companies, during the quarter, chose us to protect the data of all their remote workers. And another one of the big technology giants chose our PC protection solution for downstream sales to their customer base. We're seeing the results of rallying our company and marshaling our operational discipline around the pursuit of new revenue. As you know, it takes time to see those results flow through in an annuity-based business model. I also want to mention one other thing on the growth equation. We've significantly strengthen our leadership team, and during the last quarter, Jerry Rulli joined us as the Executive Vice President of worldwide sales at Iron Mountain. I've known Jerry's work for some time and believe that he can really bring a system of selling to our sales force and improve our capability as it relates to generating new revenue. The bottom line for all of this is that Iron Mountain is making clear progress both in helping to mitigate the near-term impacts of the economy and position our company for long-term success. We'll continue to focus on and strengthen our capabilities in the areas that drive long-term growth for our business, which include capturing the large unvended opportunity in core physical, expanding our high return model and international expansion and growing new service capabilities. I look forward to sharing more on these fronts during our upcoming Investor Day. And before I take your questions, I want to remind of you the key messages that we started with.  As illustrated in today's positive results, our business is performing and we're successfully navigating through the current economic environment and its continued impact on our business. Additionally, we're making significant progress on advancing our growth agenda to be ready to take advantage of the economy when it improves and to position Iron Mountain for the long term. I'd like to now turn the call over to the operator and take your questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: You mentioned North American price is plus 2%, and I heard the comment that CPI is tied to some of your contracts, so that could go up if CPI goes up. But my question is, we basically raise the overall margin for the year even though pricing is now, in North American box, plus 2% opposed to plus 3%. Does that mean that we're getting a lot more balance for productivity gains? And then my question is do you have any change of view on what your kind of long-term value, meaning price advantage, could be?
Robert Brennan: The point you raise is regarding the benefits that we're seeing, broad benefits that are helping to drive the gross margin gains. It's more than a pricing-only strategy. We've got benefits in terms of higher service margins from the productivity initiatives that we've advanced. On storage margins, we've had some benefit from pricing. But we've been very aggressively managing our facility utilization as a key initiative that's supporting that as well. Higher paper pricing is helping us. Energy, to a smaller degree, on a net basis has been a positive factor recently. So there're a number of factors that are helping us on that front, and we believe we can sustain that. And as we're extending many of these initiatives globally and heightening the focus on international margin improvement, we think that can be a -- this is clearly part of our long-term strategy. As far as your questions on pricing, our strategy has not changed. We continue to look to get a reasonable increase in pricing for the value of the services that we provide. We are reflecting some moderation. As you noted, for some customers, CPI-based escalators are built into their long-term contracts. That's moderated somewhat. We've seen some net business impacts. It's not one thing, but several factors and -- so that has moderated a bit. But our strategy is the same, and we delivering the same type of value and think we can sustain this as a economic driver over the long-term.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And you think you have more productivities to be gained even past 2010, right?
Robert Brennan: Absolutely.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: So it sounds like the economy is still weighing on the business despite a general sense that there's been some improvement out there for most companies. How much of this would you chalk up to Iron Mountain's later cycle characteristics? And based on what you're seeing in the broader economy, is it reasonable to expect some top line acceleration over the coming year?
Robert Brennan: Well, I think what we tried to point out, Vance, was the work that we're doing on what we can control, right, which is the pursuit of new sales. And I tried to bring that to life in my remarks, that I'm very pleased with the progress that we're having there. As you know, it takes a while for it to flow through in an annuity model. At the same time, I spend a lot of time with our biggest customers, and I'm not seeing the general improvement that I read about sometimes. But fundamentally, our business correlates to the number of people that are in offices and cubes. And we're not seeing employment return into our customer base. Now that's somewhat anecdotal, but we spend a lot of time with our customers, and the fact is, I don't see a general improvement. I don't see it in the comparables that would point to either, where there's a big uptick in employment. And that's the biggest corollary for our business, as it relates to core volume growth and core service activity, is employment. And we're not seeing much of an improvement.
Brian McKeon: Yes. Vance, I'd say we're not implying that it's worse. But I think the improvement is something that we've yet to see flow through. And so right now, we're planning for consistent trends. It's below the goals that we had this year to improve, but we think we're well-positioned to have excellent performance and flow through when the economy improves. And we're looking forward to seeing the broader improvement.
Robert Brennan: Yes. That is to say that as employment improves, we expect service activities and volume to improve. And in the meantime, we're getting after what we can control through new sales performance. And again, while it takes a while for it to flow through in our model, we're pleased with the wins that we're generating in the marketplace.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: And then on Legal. It sounds like that's been particularly weak. Any feel for when Legal, when that vertical turns around in relation to the broader economy? Is that going to be even more late-cycle than other verticals for you?
Robert Brennan: Feels that way. The thing I would tell you is that the way we're getting after it is to really increase our capability as it relates to discovery, because we already have the intellectual property in our other products. So that, in essence, we're making it easier for people to do that with us than with others. There is compression on the number of matters and the price per matter. But we think we're well positioned from a product perspective. And then if you look at it over the course of time, I don't expect litigation to go down.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: More on the costs side. It sounds like there's more productivity gains ahead on the OpEx side. Can you say the same about CapEx, which has also been trimmed? Is there more to go there in terms of capital efficiency?
Brian McKeon: We are -- we believe we can sustain the efficiencies that we've driven. We'll -- our longer-term goal was to have spending in the 9% range as a percentage of sales, as you're aware. The -- we certainly believe we can maintain the efficiencies. The thing that will drive that number up, Vance, is volume growth improving. That's where our capital is very much aligned with our growth capacity. And so we think we can sustain those levels at good growth rates. And we're in the lower -- I think we're 8.3% in the most recent mid-point outlook. And we may see some increase in that over time as we see the volume improvements that we expect to drive.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Boyer of Wells Fargo.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Bob, I think you referenced mid-single digit revenue growth, I believe for the longer term. I just want to make sure that is in line with the 6% to 10% you put forth at the Analyst Day. Or has the top end moderated a bit there for your longer-term outlook?
Brian McKeon: I'm talking more on a short-term basis than changing our longer-term outlook.
Robert Brennan: We're really enforcing the current environment that we're seeing. Our plans for 2010 and the comments today aren't a change in our perspective on the longer term potential of the business, but they're not intended to be a long-term forecast either.
Brian McKeon: Eric, it's more reacting to what we're seeing in volume as it relates to the employment picture. And we don't see that changing in the near term. So that's why we updated our guidance in the near term. It's only a near-term view.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Then International Physical. You had a tough comp in Q2. Can you give us an idea of what you're expecting in terms of the growth rate for the second half? Should we see that accelerate at all?
Robert Brennan: Q2 had an unusual lap in terms of a large project. So we should see more favorable compares on the complementary revenue side. The storage growth, as we mentioned, in our Q2 was 6% in International, and we're expecting consistent trends on the International business.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: The internal core services growth. It hit -- I think it went negative for the first time. But do you think we're bottom out here? Or what are your expectations there for the second half?
Brian McKeon: I certainly don't expect it to worsen from here. We don't have any signs.
Robert Brennan: We're planning for a consistent trend. So I think it's -- we've seen this pressure, it wasn't a significant change quarter-to-quarter, obviously, we were flat in Q1. And we're planning for continued trends until we see changes in levels of business activity moving that -- moving the dial in a different direction.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Could you guys speak to what you're seeing out there with destructions? That had been elevated, and just curious how that's trending.
Robert Brennan: Similar trends. So it's remained at relatively higher levels. So a lot more of consistency in what were seeing than change. I think the -- we are making progress on the new sales front. That does take time to flow through. As we mentioned, we've seen some moderation at the margin on the pricing. And we've seen consistent trends in terms of destructions that reflect customers being very focused on inventory control, cost control in this environment.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Could you speak to visibility? I know you've said in the past that you think the recovery in the business will come via complementary services to core services to core storage. Could you speak to that a little bit deeper? And then how much visibility into each of those that you feel you have?
Robert Brennan: We feel we have good visibility into the business that we're driving. And from a new sales perspective, a lot of what we're doing is an integrated value proposition. That's why I referred to some of the examples that I used where it's a combination of our digital capability and our physical capability. But we look at it by segment. We feel very good about the new sales performance as it relates to our core services, right, which is the majority of our business. And then building on that with the ability to convert the physical into the digital is -- it's a bourgeoning business for us, but it builds over time.
Brian McKeon: One thing I would highlight is that we're obviously having good growth in complementary revenues. Some of that's supported by the higher paper pricing this year. Some of that is also supported by service expansion, so its the DMS revenues growing. I, at this point, wouldn't highlight that as a change in sort of the economic environment. I think that's more things that we're driving within our control. We're successful in terms of providing services that are very relevant for customers right now. And so I know what your getting at. We expect the same kind of flow that we've talked about in the past, that we'd see the uptick on the margin and the complementary services first, before we'd see flow through in core services and then storage. That's sort of the timing of our business. But I wouldn't indicate that the complementary growth, right now, we see as being driven by improvement in economic conditions. It's more things that we're driving ourselves.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: And if you did see it, what would you think the timing, the lag on the others? Or really tough to say?
Robert Brennan: On something like storage. Clearly, it's a -- sale cycle takes time, and takes time for the boxes to flow through. So this is -- these are months, many months, and it's not something that's going to turn around quickly in terms of how that's going to flow through to the business. But obviously, it sustains for a long period of time too.
Brian McKeon: Yes. Maybe some backdrop on this. We -- the improvement that we're seeing from the new sales performance is a direct result of really driving the number of new deals that we have going into the proverbial top of the funnel. The cycle itself is not shortening. So we don't see improvement from that perspective. The cycle remains the same as it's always been.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: You cited Legal being weak. And just could you speak to other end market to -- Bobbie, you highlighted a lot of exciting new wins, it seemed, and you mentioned scalability. I guess just if you could speak to core verticals and how each of those are trending.
Robert Brennan: Financial services is doing very well and where we have a value proposition that can help drive their efficiencies and their costs. And they have -- I think that they're better positioned to spend in this environment. So we're doing very well with that segment. It's a very important segment for us. Healthcare, I don't seeing any significant change, although our value proposition continues to improve for that. I think that the big thing to remember here, Scott, is that our value proposition, that we continue to refine that by segment. So that we're becoming more vertically oriented in how we approach the market. And we expect that to drive gains over time. But you'll hear me become more vertical in my talk around how we're doing in performing against these segments. Financial Services continues to be our strongest segment though.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Macquarie.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Brian, I wonder if you could give us a sense of how much of the CapEx adjustment related to elevated destructions as opposed to general macro activity levels? And then as you think about that longer term. How much longer, given the current client kind of average storage that you have, can those elevated destructions remain as you look out over the next couple of quarters or years, if you will?
Brian McKeon: So Kevin, just to clarify. Your question is about how it relates to capital spending?
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Yes, that's right. So obviously, we took the CapEx down. Part of that was macro, part of it I'm thinking is elevated destructions stirring up some additional capacity. Is there any way to quantify if I'm thinking about that correctly, number one? And then number two. As you think about the average storage, how much longer can those elevated destructions remain?
Robert Brennan: Well, I think on the -- the way I'd suggest thinking about this is the net effect of higher destructions and economic pressure on just the general business activity is that the -- in the more developed markets, we're seeing limited growth on storage. So it's not as if that's freeing up space. It's just, it is putting less pressure on us needing to add, to the same degree, new capacity. It's not the same everywhere, so you always have investments in some markets that you're -- that are growing and may have more capacity needs. But that's the key dynamic that we've seen. So in terms of how it will play out I think is driven by a number of things. But economic conditions and net-net, right now we're planning for continued kind of modest volume growth. And I think our capital spending will be consistent with that. I do think over time that as volume growth improves, we still have plenty of room to run our business more efficiently in terms of our utilization of our facilities. And we think those kind of initiatives will enable us to maintain a good discipline over capital controls and hit our longer-term goals for capital efficiency. And I'm sorry if there -- I went on, I forgot the second part of your question.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Research: It was -- they were both actually related to the capital efficiency, so that was helpful.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citigroup.
Phil Stiller - Citigroup: This is Phil Stiller on for Ashwin. I just have a question related your margins. You guys have done a good job thus far in a relatively slow growth environment. As you look forward and contemplate growth improving, are there costs that are going to have to come back into the business? I.e. do you expect this kind of margin improvement in a better growth environment?
Robert Brennan: I think it goes back to what Brian was saying before, that we spend capital as volume improves. But in the cost of the business, we're -- we continue to drive operational excellence so that we can get productivity gains that are sustainable. We've demonstrated that over a course of -- Brian's last slide spoke to the last four years, two of which we actually had very strong growth. So we believe we can drive increased productivity out of our business regardless of the growth environment, notwithstanding the fact that capital does need to be deployed as growth returns.
Brian McKeon: Assuming business mix is constant, which is obviously a variable that could change over time, higher growth, I think, will be a positive margin driver in that we will get better leverage out of our business. And that as we drive scale, that creates some opportunities to get margin leverage. So I think in a higher growth environment, we would think that is a -- that would be a net favorable factor for margin improvement.
Robert Brennan: Yes, and I think that really -- in bringing us to the close of the call. It is -- it reinforces the strength of our business model that we're able to drive these kinds of financial results despite the macro impacts that we're experiencing, and that we're building this capability from a new growth perspective around what we can control. And we're pleased with the early progress that we have on that front. We appreciate your time and look forward to reporting on our results going forward.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Brennan for closing remarks.
Robert Brennan: Again, thank you very much. We very much appreciate your time this morning, and want to remind you that our business is performing well and that we're getting after a new growth in a sustainable way around those issue that we can control. And we'll look forward to reporting on our progress in the fall. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator:  Good morning. My name is Bonny and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain first quarter 2010 earnings call webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Golden, Vice President of Investor Relation. Please go ahead, Sir. 
Stephen Golden:  Thank you, and welcome everyone to our 2010 first quarter earnings conference call. After my announcement this morning, Brian McKeon will review our financial results, followed by Bob Brennan’s CEO remarks. When Bob is finished with his comments we’ll open up the phones for our Q&A.  For our custom, we have a user controlled slide present on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to slide 2; today’s earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements most notably our outlook for our 2010 financial performance.  All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today’s press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K, for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As a remainder, on our last earnings call we introduced two new metrics; adjusted OIBDA, and adjusted EPS, as part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our investor communications. We used several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results; adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow before acquisition and investments among others are metrics we speak to frequently, and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance.  We provide additional information and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures as required by Red G at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today’s press release. With that, I would like to introduce our CFO, Brain McKeon.
Brain McKeon:  Thanks Steven. Slide three highlights the key messages from today’s review. We posted solid results in the first quarter of 2010. Revenue growth of 7% was in line with expectations. Storage internal growth was solid at 4%. Service internal growth was 5%, as it’s strength in complementary service revenues, including benefits from higher paper prices offset continued softness in core services. As we work to strengthen our revenue growth, we continue to drive strong profit and free cash flow performance. For the quarter we delivered adjusted OIBDA growth of 11%, driven by gross margin expansion of nearly 200 basis points. This expansion continues to be supported by productivity and pricing gains. Proper gain in capital efficiency drove year-to-date free cash flow of $54 million.  Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.23 per share, an increase of 19% compared to the same period last year. Our reported EPS was $0.12 per share, including the impacts of the higher effective rate and a change in fiscal year end for Iron Mountain Europe from October 31 to December 31. I’ll discuss these items more fully later in my remarks.  Overall Q1 was a solid start to the year, we are on track towards delivering strong full year financial performance, consistent with the goals shared on our Q4 earnings call. We are refining our guidance today to include the expected impacts of the recent earthquakes on our Chilean Business, including items such as insurance deductibles and remediation costs.  Let’s now turn to slide four and begin or review of the first quarter results. Slide four compares results for this quarter to the first quarter of 2009. As I mentioned, revenues for the quarter were up 7% to $777 million. From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 4% internal growth, supported by 4% storage internal growth, and strong complementary service revenue performance. Overall gains were constrained by continued pressures on core service activity levels, including the impacts from our usually severe winter weather in several major markets. Our international physical segment reported 6% internal growth, supported by solid 8% growth in core revenues.  These gains were moderated by declines in complementary revenues, due primarily to lower project activity, and our legal segment reported revenue growth of 3% for the first quarter, including benefits from the Mimosa acquisition we completed at the end of February. Internal growth for the segment was minus 1% as eDiscovery gains were offset by impacts from lower subscription sales in the recent quarters.  Sustainable benefits from productivity initiatives and pricing gains, particularly in our North American Physical segment drove higher service gross margins supporting a 190 basis point improvement in our consolidated gross margin. Higher storage gross margins, aided by improved price in North American physical, and gains in our international physical business were also key contributor growth to gross margin improvements.  Adjusted OIBDA grew 11%, driven by strong gross profit gains. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $76 million, and amortization was $9 million, in line with our forecast. Other expense for the quarter was $9 million, including $5 million of charges related to foreign currency rate changes, and a $4 million one-time charge related to the change in Iron Mountain Europe’s physical year from October 31 to December 31. This charge represents the net impact of this change for two years ended December 31, 2009. There were no other effects of this change in our P&L. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.23 per share, an increase of 19% compared to the prior year, with strong operating performance and flat year-on-your interest expense. Reported EPS for the first quarter was $0.12 per share. The reported earnings were impacted by a higher affected tax rate, reflecting the impact of discrete items, which more than offset higher pretax income. The structural cash rate for the first quarter was 39%, as the impact of expired tax legislation was less than originally expected. The impact of discrete tax items, primarily related to foreign currency rate changes in the quarter added 23 points to the effective tax rate. We expect the structural tax rate for 2010 to be 39%. Let’s now take a closer look at our revenue growth on slide five. Slide five breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line, as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. As noted, our total internal growth for the quarter was 4%. Storage internal growth was solid at 4%, while complementary service revenues rebounded from a difficult 2009, to post 17% internal growth in Q1. These gains were offset by continued pressures on core service activity levels. Storage revenues, which represent more than 56% of total revenues, continued to provide an expanding foundation for overall revenue performance. Storage revenue internal growth was 4%, with gains moderated by economic affects with the constrained storage volume growth in the recent quarters.  Core service internal growth was flat for the first quarter. Growth rates were limited by lower activity levels, which remain pressured by economic conditions. We are planning for continued softness in core service activity given recent trends, as well as the select impacts from the service reductions related to the Chilean earthquakes. Overall service revenues grew 5%, reflecting a strong growth in complementary service revenues, supported by recent gains and recycled paper pricing. While paper price levels remain well above 2009 levels, they recently retreated by 15% from February and March levels, which were less than future gains.  Foreign change increase reported revenue growth by 3% in the quarter reflecting the year-over-year weakening of the US dollars. The foreign exchange rates positive effects from foreign currency will moderate as we move forward. The Mimosa acquisition has minimal impacts on our revenue growth in Q1 due to the timing of the close. Looking ahead, the Mimosa issue should add just under 1% to our reported revenue growth each quarter. Let’s now turn to slide six to review our performance on a segment basis. Slide six shows key metrics for each of our core segments compared to Q1 of 2009. As a remainder, we have distinct goals in relation to our business segments within our intergraded strategy. The North American physical segment is the key financial driver of the business, capitalizing on our core opportunities to expand our return foundation. In the international physical segment, we are expanding our capabilities goals related to our balance of costs focused on driving strong revenue returns. In our digital segment, we are looking to drive accelerated growth in attractive incremental markets. As shown on the slide, our physical businesses continue to deliver strong operating performance.  North America, our largest segment continues to drive strong profits and cash flow. We are advancing our optimization agenda, while expanding our business foundation through a targeted growth strategy, with several programs aimed at driving improved revenue growth, and our field leadership is focused on supporting its effort with the same order they use to drive operational entrance.  Our international segment is performing well, with solid revenue growth and improved profitability. We are beginning to leverage the success we had with operational excellence in North America and our larger and more developed international markets. Changes in the year-on- your exchange rates, increased the reported results in this segment by approximately 8%. We felt that CapEx, which was 14% of segment revenues in Q1, includes about $11 million incurred by Iron Mountain Europe in November and December of 2009.  In our digital segment, we are working through some of the effects of softer subscription revenues in recent quarters and growth, while investing to advance our long-term strategic agenda. The integration of Mimosa is progressing well, and will enhance our service offering in support of the selected digital growth.  Let’s turn to slide seven for a more detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow. Slide seven summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. Total capital spending was $57 million for Q1, including $3 million for real estate. As a I just mentioned, included in the total, $11 million of CapEx that was incurred by Iron Mountain Europe during November and December of 2009. Traditionally the first quarter is a light CapEx quarter, as some of our projects are scheduled for later in the year and many require time to plan it’s source before the significant expenditures are eventually made. We remain focused on aggressively driving efficiencies in our capital spending, while supporting key growth initiatives in projects that help drive long-term return improvement.  For Q1, free cash flow reported acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate as $54 million. The year-over-year decrease in free cash flow as a result of higher capital spending in 2009 compared to 2010. This grew primarily to a larger group balance at December 31, 2009, and the inclusion of the additional two months of CapEx from Europe.  For 2010, we expect free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to be approximately $340 million to $370 million, reflecting continued benefits from to our efforts to improve profitability and capital efficiency. As we announced in our Q4 earnings call in February, our board approved a $150 million share repurchase program. In the first quarter we acquired 410,000 shares for approximately $11 million. This leaves us with a balance of $139 million for additional share repurchases under the existing plan.  Let’s now turn to slide eight for a review of our key debt statistics. Our strong performance supports the continued strengthening of our balance sheet. Our debt portfolio at March 31, 2010 remained in a very strong position. Our weighted average interest rate is 6.9% and we are 87% fixed.  Maturity is just under eight years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. Consolidated leverage remained at 3.3 times, benefiting from our strong operating cash flows, while reflecting the $112 million we paid for the acquisition of Mimosa.  Our liquidity position remains strong at more than $1 billion, with $325 million in cash and $743 million in additional borrowing capacity as of quarter end. Currently we have a very strong balance sheet, and we are well positioned in terms of the cash and financing capacity.  This concludes our review of Q1 2010 results. In summary, revenue performance was in line with expectations for driving continued strong profit and cash flow performance through sustainable productivity gains, and we remain committed to strengthening our business foundation globally, while delivering strong financial performance, along track towards these goals in 2010. Let’s now turn to slide nine to review our outlook for Q2 and the full year. Slide nine summarizes our full year 2010 and Q2 guidance. Let me begin with a discussion of our outlook for next quarter. For Q2 we are projecting revenue of $785 million to $805 million. This reflects a 5% to 8% reported growth rate, including an estimated 2% to 3% benefit from foreign exchange. While we are fighting for continued solid storage growth, our outlook incorporates expectations for lower service revenue growth in Q2. We expect continued near term pressure on core service activity, and will be facing some difficulty comparisons as we have a large one-time license on digital, and a large project in Europe. These factors will likely limit service revenue gains overall in Q2, and constrain the overall internal growth to the 2% to 4% range. Growth rates in the second half are expected to improve as when compared to these. We are projecting Q2 adjusted OIBDA of $218 million to $228 million, reflecting expectations for sustained strong adjusted OIBD margins. For the full year we are reinforcing the solid fundamental outlook we discussed in our last conference call. We had to use the dollar ranges of revenue by $5 million, and adjusted OIBDA by $5 million to $10 million to reflect the impacts of the Chilean earthquakes in our full year results. As a result of the Chilean earthquakes, we experienced some damage in all of our facilities in the region. None of our facilities were destroyed by fire or impacted by water damage. However the structural integrity, 5 billion buildings was compromised and including certain buildings was damaged or destroyed. The adjustments that were made into our full year guidance reflect our expectations for loss revenues and profits, as the business works to return to normal, as well as the additional insurance and remediation costs associated with those efforts. For the enterprise, our full year outlook for reported revenue growth remains in the range of 6% to 8%, supported by internal growth of 4% to 6%. Our revenue outlook reflects expectations for solid storage growth this year, consistent with prior guidance. We are targeting an improved growth overall in the business in the second half of 2010, following some tougher comparisons in Q1 and Q2. We would note that performance at the high-end of our revenue range will require improvement in current trends for service revenues in the second half of this year. Our profit outlook remains stronger, and expectations were 7% to 11% growth in adjusted OIBDA, and strong gains in adjusted EPS. As noted we are lowering our expected capital expenditures for the year to approximate $290 million, reflecting refined capital plans and lower expectations for real estate spending. Included in our capital expenditure of approximately $290 million is about $20 million for real estate. In addition, we are investing our free cash flow outlook from $340 million to $370 million, reflecting a revised outlook for CapEx and adjusted OIBDA, and moderate to higher cash taxes.  In April, we received a $10 million cash advance on our insurance claims related to the Chilean earthquakes that will be reflected in our Q2 free cash flow. Although we respect to receive additional insurance proceeds in the future, we are not including any in our cash flow forecast at this time, as the size and timing of these receipts is uncertain. We haven’t included estimates for potential incremental 2010 capital spending related to Chile as well, as it restores their operating facility planning and timing of remediation. Thanks, and I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Brennan:  Thanks Brain, and good morning everyone. As Brain noted our quarterly financial results came in as expected. Our internal revenue growth improved somewhat, despite difficult comparisons and continued pressures from the economy and service revenues. We continued to deliver strong profit growth and cash flow. Overall, Q1 was the solid start to the year, and Ron tracked towards delivering strong financial performance this year. Key messages that you should hear in today’s update; first our financial performance remains strong. The performance reflects the strength of our business model and the gains that we continue to drive through our focus on operational excellence across our business. We are working on improving our growth trajectory, guarding aggressively against new business with positive early results. This emphasis will help offset continued pressures on service activity and the impact on select factors such as the earthquake in Chile.  Third, we are making good progress against our strategic priorities, including driving growth and improved returns in our international business, expanding our technology services offering, and continuing to strengthen our organization. Let me start by providing an update on our growth agenda.  We are making progress on the growth front, despite some continued head wins in the business. Our quarterly growth performance was in line with expectations. Storage growth, a key financial drive for Iron Mountain was solid at 4%, as expected results and moderation in storage growth in Q1 reflecting impacts on lower new sales levels and higher destructions during 2009. Destructions have stabilized; we are working on driving new sales and believe we are on-track towards achieving our full year objectives of storage revenues. Overall, internal growth result was 4%, as benefits from factors like higher paper pricing, offset continued pressures on core service activity. Service activity is dropping substantially during the economic downturn and we continue to see lower transportation and starting service levels, which are offsetting gains with the realigning in the areas like DMS. We were focused on strengthening our gross trajectory as we work through the year on factors that are in our control. In this context, we’ve concentrated efforts within our organization, on capturing the large un-mended opportunities we see in our business. We have a number of programs targeting and driving improved growth, and extended our field leadership on supporting this effort with the same rigor that they used to drive operational excellence. Of course, we are also working on improving our growth rate in digital. We’ve added new services like eVantage to address evolving customer requirements for eDiscovery services, with added classifying collect that allows our PC backup customers to easily identify it, which is subject to legal hold and we expanded the storage we could have in our server backup offerings; all of which will help strengthen our recurring storage pipeline and overall revenue. While it’s still very early, we are making progress on the new sales front. We are landing new business opportunities in the data protection space, improved our competitiveness and strength, and our field organization is driving increased pipeline activity in records management. In digital we are strengthening our subscription sales pipeline, which will drive benefits in terms of occurring revenue gains. We’ve got work to do, but we feel positive about this early progress towards improving our new sales performance.  As we focus on improving growth trends in the near term, we are also advancing on our long-term strategic agenda. As we’re seeing in our quarterly results, we continue to drive strong operating performance in our core North American operations. The business is running well, and a key area of Iron Mountain involves extending this operating capability to drive growth and improve returns in our international operations. As we noted, this is an area where we are driving improved momentum, and one that will be a key factor supporting strong financial performance in 2010 and beyond. We are on track of the strong performance in our international business this year, and we’ve begun deploying that North American play for operational excellence and our more detailed in international markets such as the UK and Australia. Productivity gains in these markets will enable continued investment against global expansion, while driving strong profit gains. We are pleased with the capability and progress we are advancing on this front, and see this as an area where we can continue to build upon for the long term.  We are emphasizing the expansion of technology services, a key driver of our long-term strategy as well. As noted on our year-end call, we recently completed the acquisition of Mimosa Systems. Mimosa provides enterprise class on premise archiving services, so that we can better benefit on business continuity, compliance and litigation readiness.  Mimosa deployed its next generation technology and complements our existing suit of different products. With Mimosa, Iron Mountain now has the ability to store and applies information wherever it resides, whether it’s at the customer location or offering an increased choice and flexibility for managing our information.  The integration of Mimosa is going well, and Mimosa’s CEO, T.M. Rodney, has agreed to become the head of marketing for our digital business. This expansion of our technology services offerings helps to strengthen our digital business, and also helps to strengthen our value proposition across all our service lines.  See our customer’s records and information management challenges are not neatly arranged into silos by format. It struggling to manage the risks and costs associated with information grows across all formats, and are looking to solution providers with a broad range of expertise the capability for much needed help. Iron Mountain is uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity, as these will work across all formats and have more experience in management records. 
 : In March we welcomed Al Verrecchia, Chairman of Hasbro to our Board of Directors. Al led a highly successful of Hasbro and we’ll certainly benefit from his executive leadership on our board. Overall, we are making good progress against our strategic agenda. Now before I conclude my remarks, I am going to mention the financial impact of the Chilean earthquake. Chilean has always been a great business for Iron Mountain, and the response to this disaster has only further distinguished their greatness. All 850 of our employees are safe. We have coordinated a worldwide effort around Iron Mountain to help them help our customers, and those round the clock efforts have also included providing humanitarian aid. We are very proud of their performance. But before I take your questions, let me summarize. We had a solid quarter that was in line with our expectations. We are on track towards delivering strong financial performance this year. We have been concentrating our efforts around the new proven growth trajectory, while advancing our long-term strategic priorities to capture the potential we see for our business. Thanks Now we’ll open the phone lines and take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Kevin Mcveigh - Macquarie Research.
Kevin Mcveigh - Macquarie Research:   I was wondering if you could talk about the CapEx a little bit. I know we took it down to 290. As we think about that going forward, is that a new range as a percentage of revenue or just some thoughts on the CapEx.
Bob Brennan: Kevin, as you know we talked at our Investor Day about our longer-term goal in the range of 9%. We still think that that’s a good longer-term goal. We are a bit below that currently. We may see some moderate increases from the current levels overtime as storage growth improves which is our plan, but we think that that 9% level, that longer term goal is still the goal for us.
Kevin Mcveigh - Macquarie Research: Great. And could you just quantify, how much did the weather impact the core services in the first quarter?
Bob Brennan: It was a couple of million dollars. It was focused on some of the Atlantic markets and wanted to highlight it as an additional factor. It had some impact on the core services growth.
Kevin Mcveigh - Macquarie Research: Great, and then just one more and I’ll get back in the queue. The Chilean earthquake, the $10 million negative impact, what did that relate to? I know you discussed it a little bit, but can you just clarify it for me a little bit. The $10 million negative impact from the earthquakes in Chili, what did that relate to.
Bob Brennan: Yes, we highlighted two impacts; one was on revenue, which we estimate for the full year to be about $5 million, and on OIBDA a range of $5 million to $10 million. The impact on the revenue is just expectations for some decreased service activity and some loss storage revenue. Some of the records that were impacted, basically some records sold over in the facilities, and when they get co-mingled with others we destroy them, because we cant endure their integrity, and we are expecting some storage revenue.  The profit impacts, obviously there is some impact from the lawsuits. We are also factoring in things like our insurance deductibles and some steps we took to strengthen our insurance coverage, just given this was a significant event. Our clam will be sizable, we are every comfortable with our insurance coverage, but we took some conservative steps just to make sure that we have adequate coverage going forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman – JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman – JPMorgan: With the 4% internal growth on storage for the first quarter, and 4% to 5% for the year, I was wondering if you think internal growth for storage is leaning forward. You you’re your comments about the second quarter overall, but do you fell like storage will stay in this kind of 4% to 5% range. In the year, if I got you correctly, I though I heard you say that the higher level of destructions have now stabilized.
Bob Brennan: Thanks correct. A couple of things Andrew; as far as next quarter we are expecting storage growth in a similar range to Q1. As we’ve noted, we are still working though some of the tougher comparisons and those comparisons should ease later this year.  In terms of some of the key factors, destructions have stabilized. So they are still at healthy levels, but the trend had been going up and we fell comfortable that things are moving in a better direction than they were. The key factor that’s going to help us on improving the storage rate over time is going to be progress on the new sales from. I think there are good results in that area and that will take some time to fall through of course, but ours are better with progress. 
Brain McKeon: I’m particularly pleased Andrew with the progress that we have in generating new sales. The field leadership I mentioned just briefly in my comments has really been able to pivot and focus on driving new revenue, and we’ve got an awful lot in a pipeline that is expanding. The code of performance year-over-year is much stronger, and the fact is we’ve got the North American operations running very well. That allows us to just become much more external in our focus in driving new revenue. 
Bob Brennan: I’ll also highlight our international storages is growing mid to high single digit. Based on some of the progress we made in areas like continental Europe and other expansion markets are doing quite well. So we feel we are on a good path. As you know, it takes a little time for the growth rates to change in storage, but we think we are moving this in the right direction. 
Andrew Steinerman – JPMorgan: And Bob, you just mentioned new business driving storage growth to accelerate in the back half of the year, Is that always part of the plan. I mean won’t storage also accelerate as non-foreign payroll goes up.
Bob Brennan: So the flow through benefits takes some time, but the fact is we feel much better about new sales this year, than we did last year at this time.
Brain McKeon: Andrew I know you appreciate this, but I think in terms of factors like the economy, we would expect, the first things that we would see would be improvements in more discretionary spending, some of the project activity, things on the new sales front. The next benefit would be more which will lag somewhat, but we would expect service activity to improve, and I think the last thing we would expect to see is kind of the flow through of the economy.  For storage, just given that it takes some time for people to create the incremental records and to sort them, we are in a kind of storage business. So it will head back over time but I just want to caution that we are still working through some of the lag effects and we think we are prudent in terms of our outlook in that context. To summarize, we feel very good about what we can control in driving new business, and believe that service activity will rebound as the economy rebounds. I mean you know how strong it was in 2008 as we entered the downturn.
Andrew Steinerman – JPMorgan: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird: I was wondering if you could just address service a little more, because I think this was the first time that it actually really hadn’t posted any growth at all. Just a little bit more on what actually kind of weakened sequentially and then how do we think about growth and how it has accelerated throughout the year?
Brain McKeon: Yes, in terms of core service, I mean we’ve been highlighting this for a couple of quarters, but the activity levels in areas like transportation services, trading services have been pressures to the premium services. Yes we saw greater pressure recently through the economic downturn; we obviously were at a high value added proposition for our customers and premium services like rush delivery levels were a significant decline and that cost focuses continued with customers.  I think, also note that in some areas we may not have been as competitive as we needed to be. We’ve been improving things like our pricing equation. I think in trading we may have stirred that a little too far; we’ve been making some adjustments on that front.  So net-net we are still seeing soft activity. We are planning for that to continue in the near term. We do expect that to improve over time, but it will lag improvement in general economic activity and we’re going to be working through those comparisons for the next couple of quarters.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird: And then on the IT side, we’ve just kind of generally been hearing comments about companies looking to increase their IT spend and kind of playing through more of the IT refreshed cycle. I think [Gardner] also recently increased their projections for IT spend. Just kind of curious what you are seeing in terms of the time line for IT expanding improvements, and you know has that really changed much recently.
Brain McKeon: So, Andreas anecdotal feedback is to spend a lot of time with customers, I don’t see IT budgets going up in any kind of significant way. What we do see is that de-capitalization of IT, which is favoring a services model and outsourced model. The thing about a subscription model is that while we were up 4% in 2009, it lags coming in and it doesn’t have a spiky effect on revenue, but we’ve had strong progress on these sales, and I feel very good about just from a macro perspective the fact that IT is going towards more of a ‘pay as you use’ model and that’s a trend that a lot of players have to adjust to more dramatically than we do, and it’s always been our business model.
Andrea Wirth - Robert W. Baird: All right, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Gold - Sidoti.
David Gold - Sidoti: Can we speak a little bit more on the record center optimization productivity improvement program? Just, again sort of how you think about things domestically? I know it's a moving target, and I know there's more to it, but sort of how far along are we on that and if we've gotten that off the ground overseas and sort of where we are there too?
Brain McKeon: We have David. It’s essentially we move from market to market and having productivity from the system we have done that very well throughout North America, and we do it from the standpoint of sustainability, so we are adding new programs as well, so we can talk to procurement initiative in the last quarter that will really focus on strengthening our gains and consistency across North America.  We have the began exporting the playbook most notable to the U.K, but also to other material markets like Australia, and we feel very good that over time we can presume North American returns out of our mature international business.  So its in the mussel memory of the company and that business is running very well while is why we are practicality enthused about the potential to grow the business through new cells because of the fact that the business is running well and we can be more external in our focus. This is something that we had to work on internally for years to get this kind of rhythm, but we feel very comfortable with where we are in that regards as it relates to record center optimization, productivity thought our business and realizing that on a sustainable bases. 
David Gold - Sidoti: Is there much more in North America that you think we can squeeze out?
Brain McKeon: I think we are continuing to roll out. The process orientation, the process focus on how we manage the business, because Bob noted we are on to a kind of a net phase of initiatives in areas like procurement. We see a lot of opportunities in our organization, just how we interface with the customer and go to market.  I highlight that, we think there is efficiencies there. We do want to reinvest those efficiencies to accelerate growth. We think that’s an opportunity for us to become more effective and efficient and so we are committed to continuing to improve our profitability. We think we’ve established very good capabilities in areas like piecing and in just our process approach to running the business to enable us to keep making progress as we move forward and as an enterprise we have other areas to help us drive margin improvement.  Most notably we think there is a significant opportunity on the international business as you know the margins there relative to our business are currently quite a bit lower. There is some of that is the stage of development in that business in the investments that we are making and the expansion markets but that’s also represents the significant opportunity for us. Also the major business like gains in scales. So we have a number of things that we believe can help us sustain strong profit performance and revenuer growth as we move forward. 
Bob Brennan: Lets remember the primary driver behind this, we always new that we will be able to be more effective that for produce stronger operating margins as a result of _ . the primary driver was so that we would establish the level of value in the market place that we could then drive though new sales and the value proposition that’s realty unmatched in our business,
Operator: Your next question comes from Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley:  First in terms of recycle paper can you comment on what you are seen on the front lines in terms of your ability to sell the paper as your volumes builds. Are you able to secure favorable pricing, can you work directly with large buyers of the commodity for example, would you say you are essentially behold into whatever the spot rate is?
Brain McKeon: We have a relationships with companies like waste management, significant partners to help us manage that and that helps us to have a secure avenue for sales overtime. Our pricing is impacted by this spot market so we do see fluctuations in the pricing levels, overtime consisting with the market. We are quiet comfortable in our ability to secure buyers for the paper.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Okay, got it; and on the capital spending priorities going forward, would you say that will largely mirror the first quarter break out; in other words, mainly storage and maybe half that amount on IT. Any changes to the mix anticipated?
Brain McKeon: Our outlook for this year, is similar to our long range goals. The bulk of our spending is related to storage systems, that’s imported growth. So that’s physical and digital, and a smaller percentage of our spending is on things like IT and strategic initiatives and infrastructure, so the bulk of our spending remains related to growth oriented capital.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Okay, it makes sense. And then speaking of growth orient capitals, beyond the established international markets where you still have room for growth, what’s the latest in terms of international expansion into brand new less developed markets. What regions are you really looking at to create a first time presence now?
Brain McKeon: To create our first time presence; I mean if you look where we were not, we’re still not in Japan, we’re not in Africa, we’re not in Middle East, in those areas that we are always looking for the right joint venture partners to enter the market with. We are most successful when we go in with the local partners that knows the local market. China is an area where you could argue that we have some flags planted, but there is a lot of opportunity for us to improve our presence in that region, and we recently brought on some talent that will help us to do that.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Okay, and in the more developed markets, is there room for contiguous expansion geographically or would you say to drive revenues it's more a matter of increasing penetration and density in the geography that you already have.
Brain McKeon: I mean specifically if you look at Brazil, Russia, and India we have very good business that we are think we can -- Brazil, it’s economy to expect that’s move up the stack rank if you will in the next two years, and we think that something that we can take advantage of. Russia we have a great business in our joint venture partners and we are very pleased with the way that’s going, and remember that there is a ton of room in continental Europe as well.  You know we are still in the earlier stages of scaling these individual countries. Unlike North America, Spain is different from Germany, which is different from France and those businesses still have a lot of improvement. In a time scale that’s measured in years you will see more improvement there, than you will from markets where we are just entering.
Operator: Our next question is from John Healy - Northcoast Research.
John Healy - Northcoast Research: I want to talk a little bit about North American physical revenue growth in the quarter. I was curious if you could give us a little bit of color in terms of maybe the component of growth, kind of how much you're seeing from activity levels and creation and maybe how much you're seeing from a pricing stand point?
Brain McKeon: Just in terms of storage, it was solid, we noted it was 4%. We are getting benefits from pricing to support that, but it’s driving positive volume as well. Its obliviously moderated from what we used to, driven by some of the impact last year; the higher destruction rates and the softer new sales, but overall we’re continuing to grow solid storage revenue growth, and we are looking to improve that as we move forward.  The service activity was supported by a couple of factors. Obviously through paper pricing, we are seeing very good growth on the DMS front, and those factors are offset by the softness that we see on service activity levels and also kind of on a select basis some of the more additional project work that we have done, that is related to managing hybrid records, which we think has kind of taken a softer activity in some of the sales pipeline that we saw from last year.  On balance it’s solid growth inline with what we are hoping to achieve and we are working on other things that we think we can improve that overtime, and position us well for when we see some of the benefits of the economy improving.
John Healy - Northcoast Research: And Brian, I thought you mentioned in a prior question that the first thing you'd see is some of the discretionary parts of your business that you’re firming before other parts would. If you were to exclude the impact of recycled paper prices in the complementary service lines, would you be starting to see that kind of discretionary element of the business picking up or have you got to experience that?
Brain McKeon: We are seeing that. It was positive in the first quarter, and that was supported by DMS, also by our eDiscovery business, but that is a favorable factor. It’s moving forward sequentially. I don’t want to give you an impression it’s turned around quickly. It’s moving in the right direction, but those early indicators we are seeing some of the positive factors and just I need to be the voice of caution here, and I just want to make sure that people know it. It takes time for some of the benefits to flow through our business and we are going to be working through this in the next couple of quarters, but we do see some signs that its moving in the right direction and we are working on things that will hopefully strengthen that.
Bob Brennan:   Just a fact; remember that we lag in to the downtown and we lag coming out of it. Its just the nature of our business model?
John Healy - Northcoast Research: No it's encouraging that piece is at least poking its head up a little bit. Lastly just on the shutting side of the business; I thought you mentioned you may have changed a little bit in the price and value proposition. Can you talk a little bit about maybe how that business performed excluding recycled paper prices in the quarter, and what you think a realistic growth rate for that business could be this year?
Brain McKeon: The revenues in the business were up solidly in Q1, supported by paper. It’s a little difficult to separate paper from the overall business, because as you might imagine the competitive dynamic is that flows into the overall economics and it influences how you would price your services and things of that nature.  Our service revenues were down moderately, but overall it was the quarter for shredding and we think we can have solid growth in that business this year, again aided by some of the macro factors. Bob you want to talk about some of the dynamics.
Bob Brennan: Yes, John this is narrower I think. We constructively dipped that with the way we competed last year, and we think we allowed our competition some entry and that we are being more aggressive now, and I believe we’ll see the benefits of that, because we have a value proposition that is differentiated from that of our competition, especially as it relates to the chain of custody.  We have specific programs in place that allow our sales force to really attack competition, where we gave them a little bit of room last time and we shouldn’t have done that, but we are also working through channels here, so you can expect to see announcements from some of our partners, specifically in the commercial real estate space, and some more to come on that, but where people see the usefulness of offering shredding to their customers; whether it would be an in-office space or other locations that will hope to announce later in the year.
Operator: Our next questions comes from Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities: Yes I suspect that you want, but do you expect any change in seasonality patterns for total consolidated results now that the European business will have a calendar year-end?
Brain McKeon: Not from the European change. In fact, one of the conclusions as we went through this process was significant effort for the team to kind of deviate on this and get us to a place where we are fully aligned in terms of our reporting globally. The conclusion was, there wasn’t really material affect from the seasonality change, so that enables us to keep the change relatively simple and have a one time charge pull through the other expense line. So the short answer is no, there shouldn’t be an effect in that.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities: And then with the situation like the, the winter weather that was experienced in the, in the first quarter will any of that revenue be pushed out into the second quarter or is the majority of that type of service revenue lost?
Brain McKeon: It’s hard to asses, but I wouldn’t count on that being a push out. I think that’s related to normal activity that didn’t happen and we are not expecting it to. I think the key thing on the service sides to recognizes is, which we try to highlight is; one thing is the course of this activity remains soft and we are planning for that to continue for decline in the near term. That we are against a couple of tough comparison in Q2.  We had big project in Italy last year that was very beneficial. We’ll work through the lapping on that, and get a large license on digital. So there’s a couple of factors that are going to moderate growth. Paper pricing came down 15%, so that’s less of a benefit, but net-net, I think overall in the business we feel good. We got the storage movement on a good track. We are seeing some positive sings, and we’re looking forward to getting through some of the transition phase here and get to a solid growth rate moving in 2011.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities: And then with the subscription weakness within digital, which type of the digital subscriptions would you expect to come back first and are you seeing any positive signs that that's happening?
Brain McKeon: Yes, we are definitely see positive signs as it relates to pipelines. eDiscovery is a very strong business for us. We are very, very pleased with Mimosa and our backlog offerings have become more competitive. I mentioned it quickly in my remarks, but we’ve added capability to our backup offerings that we think opens up the market opportunity for us and we are seeing a promise out of our sales versus to driving increased activity in the pipeline. Keep in mind it’s the subscription model, so we don’t get the lumps that come positively or negatively would being a professional licensed business that you’ll find in many technology companies. We are seeing solid growth in the subscription pipeline, so we’ll look for that to benefit our results going forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Company.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Company: My first question actually, if you guys can give some color commentary on your industry verticals for 1Q and it possible like what you have going it like 2Q?
Brain McKeon: We don’t report granule basis, I would say that in terms of verticals we are very focused strategically in areas like healthcare and government in terms of long-terms growth rate and we are pleased with the progress that we are making on that from. Financial services is obviously a big vertical for us and we are seeing substantially different trends across our verticals, I think they are relatively consistent business…
Bob Brennan: we are on the right tack though as it relates to the kind of opportunity we fix. We see a lot of usefulness in building our organizations to really drive depth into those industries that are highly regulated with a lot of knowledge. Workers still think financial services, healthcare, legal and you can see through our service offerings that we are becoming more verticalised and you can expect that will become more verticalized in our approach to the market overtime, but we don’t expect to breakout the results specifically by quarter.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Company: My following question actually was, the fuel price are up year-over-year quite significantly, if you guys can just give some color on overall energy cost.
Brain McKeon: Our overall energy cost remain in the 2% to 3% range, it wasn’t a big driver of our margins one way or the other and we are just fuel charges which have been not been material in recent quarters, but we saw our consists an increase is on that prompt we have some ability to offset that with the fuel charges.
Operator: At this time there are no further question, are there closing remarks.
Brain McKeon: Thank you very much. I very much appreciate your time this morning and we feel very good about the business, we feel very good about our prospects and look forward to reporting to you again next quarter. Thanks your time today.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2009 Q4  (2010-02-25 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Stephen Golden – VP, IR Brian McKeon – EVP and CFO Bob Brennan – President and CEO
Analysts: David Gold – Sidoti Andrew Steinerman – JPMorgan Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi Justin Hawk [ph] – Robert W. Baird
Operator: Good morning. My name is Taylor and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q4 2009 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. Mr. Golden, you may begin.
Stephen Golden: Thank you and welcome everyone to our 2009 fourth quarter earnings conference call. After my announcement this morning, Brian McKeon will review our financial results, followed by Bob Brennan's CEO remarks. When Bob is finished, we will open up the phones for our Q&A. Following today's earnings call, Brian and I will be presenting at the RW Baird Business Solutions Conference here in Boston. As you may have seen in today's earnings release, we introduced two new metrics, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS as part of our ongoing effort to enhance our investor communications. The year-over-year growth in these metrics is an important measure of our performance. As such, we believe that excluding certain components of these results will be helpful with respect to comparability. Adjusted OIBDA is operating income before depreciation and amortization, excluding asset gains and losses. This metric more accurately reflects how we plan, forecast and evaluate the performance of our business. Adjusted EPS is reported EPS, excluding asset gains and losses, other income expense, the tax impact of these reconciling items and discrete tax items and net income loss attributable to non-controlling interest. This metric more accurately reflects how we forecast our earnings. Both metrics also facilitate the comparison of our results for the current periods and guidance for future guidance with results for past periods. Per our custom, we have a user controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website, at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to slide two, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2010 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our current report on Form 8-K filed on March 8, 2009 for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments among others are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information in the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. With that, I would like to introduce our CFO, Brian McKeon.
Brian McKeon: Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. We've got a lot to cover today, let's go right to it. Slide three highlights the key messages from today's review. Q4 wrapped up a strong year of financial performance for Iron Mountain as we continued to deliver strong year-on-year profit and cash flow gains despite economic impacts that are constraining top line growth. Revenue performance in the quarter was as expected. Storage internal growth was a solid 5% with gains moderated by the impact of constrained new sales and higher destruction we've experienced in recent quarters reflecting recessionary impacts. Service revenues were flat overall as continued pressure on activity levels offset solid gains in areas such as eDiscovery services. Despite economic impacts, we continue to deliver strong profit and free cash flow performance. This is a result of our focus on operational excellence including productivity initiatives, pricing program improvements, and overhead and capital spending controls. This focus enabled us to drive almost 300 basis points of improvement in our adjusted OIBDA margin this year with solid gains across each of our major business segments. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted OIBDA growth of 14% on a reported basis and 12% excluding the impacts of foreign currency rate changes. About 2% of this growth is due to the initial re-characterization of vehicle leases discussed in prior conference calls. We also continued to improve our cash flows and strengthen our balance sheet. Free cash flow for 2009 reached and all-time high of $336 million, driven by strong profit performance and controlled capital spending. Looking ahead to 2010, we are targeting improved revenue growth and strong sustainable underlying operating performance. Today, we are raising our guidance to reflect recent performance, changes to macro factors, and the impact of the Mimosa acquisition. Today, we also announced that our Board of Directors has approved a $150 million share repurchase authorization and a dividend with an annual rate of $0.25 per share. These actions are a direct result of our strong cash generation performance and reflect our confidence our long-term growth potential and our commitment to delivering long-term shareholder value. I'll talk more about this later in my remarks. Let's turn now to slide four and begin with our review of fourth quarter results. Slide four compares our results for this quarter to the fourth quarter of 2008. Reported revenues for the quarter were up 4% to $779 million. From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 2% internal growth, supported by solid 5% storage internal growth. Storage gains and improved paper prices offset soft service revenues, resulting from lower core service activity levels. Our International Physical segment reported 4% internal growth, supported by solid 7% growth in storage and core services. These gains were moderated by declines in complementary revenues, due primarily to lower paper revenues and project activity. In our Digital segment, growth improved to 5% in the fourth quarter, driven by continued strong performance in our eDiscovery business. These gains more than offset storage weakness, resulting from lower subscription sales. Benefits from operational excellence initiatives drove higher service margins in our North American Physical segment, supporting a 340 basis point improvement in our consolidated gross margin. Higher storage gross margins, aided by improved pricing in North American Physical and solid gains in our International Physical business was also a key contributor to gross margin gains. As a reminder, gross profits for the quarter also benefitted from the $5 million in rent expense, resulting from the re-characterization of certain vehicle leases. Adjusted OIBDA grew 14% on a reported basis and 12% excluding the impact of FX changes. This improvement was driven by gross profit gains and controlled SG&A growth of 7% as we continue to focus investment on initiatives aimed at driving growth and gross profit improvements. For the quarter, depreciation was $74 million and amortization was $9 million, slightly below our forecast. Finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter increased 23% to $0.27 per share, reflecting strong operating performance and interest expense that was flat to last year. As a reminder, the reconciliation of adjusted EPS to reported EPS can be found in today's earnings release or at the Investor Relations page of our website. Let's now take a closer look a tour revenue growth on slide five. Slide five breaks down our overall revenue growth, shows internal growth on major service line, as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. As noted, our total internal growth for the quarter was 3%. Storage growth though still solid, moderated to 5% as expected. These gains were offset by continued pressures on service revenues. Storage revenues, which represent more than 56% of total revenues, continue to provide and expanding foundation for overall revenue performance. Storage internal growth for the quarter was supported by solid performance in North America and strong growth in international expansion markets, particularly Continental Europe. As expected, we saw some moderation in storage revenue growth, reflecting impacts from longer sales cycles and continued higher destruction activity. Core service internal growth was 1%. Gains were constrained by lower service activity levels in the handling and transportation of records and secure shredding services, areas that continue to be impacted by economic conditions. Complementary service revenue internal growth was minus 1% for the quarter. The decline in complementary service revenues was less than in recent quarters due to continued strong performance in our eDiscovery business and improved recycled paper prices. While recycled paper revenue gains were limited in the quarter due to economic pressures on recycling volumes, this is no longer a negative factor impacting our growth performance. Foreign exchange increased reported growth by 1% in the quarter as trends in this front improved. We should see moderately positive effects at current exchange rates as we moving forward. Let's now turn to slide six to review our full year operating performance. Slide six looks at our full year operating performance compared to 2008. Reported revenues exceeded $3 billion, down slightly versus the prior year as unfavorable foreign currency changes reduced reported revenue growth by 4%. These impacts offset positive internal revenue growth gains of 3%. As we'll discuss in our guidance review, we expect to see improvements on both of these fronts in 2010. For the full year, we achieved a 10% improvement in adjusted OIBDA, which was a 14% gain on a constant dollar basis. As a reminder, gross profit and adjusted OIBDA, each benefitted from a $20 million decrease in rent expense, resulting from the re-characterization of certain vehicle leases. These results reflected a 300 basis point improvement in both our gross margin and operating OIBDA – and our adjusted OIBDA margin, supported by our focus on operational excellence including sustainable gains from productivity and pricing initiatives. These operating gains and a 4% decrease in interest expense drove a 22% increase in adjusted EPS. 2009 was also a year of improved capital efficiency, which combined with our strong profit performance, drove record free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments of $336 million. Let's move now to slide seven for a review of the full year from a segment perspective. Slide seven shows key metrics for each of our four segments compared to 2008. As we discussed at Investor Day last October, each of our major business segments plays a distinct role within our integrated strategy. In north – in the North American Physical segment, we are focused on capitalizing on our core opportunities to drive growth and returns, demonstrating the power of the Iron Mountain model. In the International Physical segment, we are building up the global foundation through a balanced approach, driving growth and higher returns in developed markets, while developing the next generation of file rooms [ph] in expansion markets. In the Digital, we are extending our capabilities in high-growth incremental markets. We've already discussed our revenue performance for 2009 and I will have more to say on this when we are reviewing our 2010 outlook. A key takeaway from this slide is that despite top line pressure, each of our major business segments is reporting improved operating performance and capital efficiency. North America, our largest segment, continues to drive higher profits, cash flow, and returns. We continue to drive our optimization agenda, while expanding our business foundations through a targeted growth strategy. Significant growth opportunities exist in the unvended storage and DMS markets for this segment and we are evolving our go-to-market capability and strategy to capture this potential. Our International segment continues to improve as we develop scale in our expansion markets and drive higher growth and profitability in our larger established markets. Due to the significant year-on-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar against all major currencies in 2009, our reported results were reduced by approximately 16%. As noted, at current rates, FX should be a positive factor moving forward, allowing us to benefit from the momentum and performance for driving in this business. Finally, our Digital business continues to make progress against its strategic agenda, while delivering solid profitability even in this difficult economic environment. Our eDiscovery business had a very successful year and we are excited to add the Mimosa acquisition to our portfolio. Let's turn to slide eight for a more detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow. Slide eight summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow for the year, performance that drove record results for Iron Mountain. Total capital spending was $321 million for 2009 including $36 million for real estate. This represents a 14% decrease from our 2008 levels, reflecting continued focus on the capital allocation process and lower-than-forecasted real estate spending. Our capital efficiency continues to improve as capital spending excluding real estate decreased to 9.4% of revenues in 2009 from 10.8% in 2008. We expect to build on this progress in 2010. This reduction in capital spending, combined with our increased profitability, drove free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments to a record $336 million. Our sustained strong profit and cash flow performance was instrumental in our Board's decision to advance payouts to shareholders. I'll speak more to this in a moment. But first, let's turn to slide nine to review our debt statistics. Our focus on cash flow improvement is supporting continued strengthening of our balance sheet and liquidity. Our debt portfolio at the end of 2009 remained in a very strong position. Our weighted average interest rate is 7% and were 87% fixed. Maturity is now at 8.1 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. Consolidated leverage at the end of the year was 3.3 times, benefitting from our strong operating cash flows and limited acquisition activity over the last two years. The acquisition of Mimosa is expected to increase our leverage ratio by only about 10 basis points. Our liquidity position has also improved to more than $1.1 billion with $447 million in cash and $700 million in additional borrowing capacity as of year-end. Currently, we have a very strong balance sheet and we are well positioned in terms of our cash and financing capacity and we are making comfortable operating at or below the low end of our target leverage range of 3.5 to 4.5 times in the current environment. This concludes our review of Q4 2009 results. In summary, revenue performance was as expected. We are driving strong sustainable profit and cash flow performance through our focus on operational excellence and we remain committed to strengthening our business foundation globally while delivering strong financial performance and believe we are well positioned to build on that progress in 2010. Let's now turn to slide 10 to discuss today's shareholder payout announcement before concluding with our updated 2010 guidance. As Bob will discuss in his remarks today, we announced the advancement of program supporting shareholder payouts as part of our financial approach. As context, over the last two years, Iron Mountain has generated more than $400 million of free cash flow after $700 million of capital expenditures including real estate. This performance has resulted in a substantial lowering of our leverage ratios as we've expanded our business. We intend to build on this progress and are targeting sustained strong free cash flow and expanding profitability as we move forward. Our strong cash flow performance, combined with the strong balance sheet, gives us substantial capacity to invest in our growth agenda, including targeted acquisitions, while supporting payouts to shareholders. The shareholder payout approach we are advancing reflects our confidence in our long-term growth outlook and our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders. The quarterly dividend, which we intend to grow over time, will serve as the foundation for shareholder payouts. Based on the closing price of our stock at February 19th, this represents a 1% dividend yield. The share repurchase program will serve as an additional vehicle for capital deployment. The $150 million authorization represents about 3% of our outstanding common stock based on the closing price on February 19th. All share repurchases are subject to stock price, market conditions, corporate and legal requirements and other factors. The Board has granted the authority to establish trading plans under SEC rule 10b5-1. This will allow us to repurchase shares in the open market during periods in which the stock trading window is otherwise is closed to the company. The advancement of payouts to shareholders is a significant milestone in the evolution as – of our company and we are excited to announce this today. Let's now review our 2010 outlook. In terms of our guidance for 2010, there are three key messages you should hear today. The first is that we are targeting improved revenue growth in 2010, supported by 4% to 6% internal revenue gains. While we are planning for continued headwinds from economic factors heading into 2010, we are committed to driving improved growth as we move forward and expect a benefit from more favorable macro factors such as improved – improvements in FX and recycled paper pricing. We also intend to drive strong adjusted OIBDA growth, supported by a continued progress on our North American productivity initiatives and improved profits in our International business segment. Our objectives in 2010 call for 7% to 12% reported growth in adjusted OIBDA, building on our solid 2009 results. These objectives reflect the solid progress in operational improvements we continue to drive across our business. Finally, we are adjusting our guidance for the impact of our recently announced acquisition of Mimosa. For 2010, we expect Mimosa to add about $20 million to our annual revenues. This deal will be modestly dilutive to earnings in 2010 due to current operating losses and integration costs. Based on expected synergies and strong revenue growth, however, Mimosa is expected to generate positive adjusted OIBDA beginning in 2011. Let's review our outlook in more detail, starting with a breakdown of our revenue growth guidance. The table on slide 12 shows our expectations for internal growth and total growth in 2010 including impact from FX and acquisitions. As noted, we are targeting internal growth in the 4% to 6% range. While below our long-term target rates, in the high-single digit internal growth trends seen just before the financial crisis, this outlook reflects an improved growth trajectory that should put us on track for higher growth as the economy recovers. We continue to expect storage growth to be in the mid-single digits, reflecting current trends and impact from 2009 activity. The storage costs will be more difficult early in 2009, particularly in Q1, given the carryover effect of softer new sales and higher destructions through 2009. These comparisons will improve as we work through the year. We are planning for continued softness in core service activity levels until we see clearer signs of improvement and expect this revenue growth to be between 1% and 5% in 2010. With respect to our complementary revenues, we are expecting a significant improvement over 2009, which will support our overall internal growth rate of 4% to 6%. The increase in complementary revenue growth is 8% to 15%, is driven by continued strong performance in our eDiscovery business, easier comps, and higher paper prices. These gains are being mitigated as the demand for special projects remain soft. We also expect the impact of the recent increase in recycled paper prices to be partially offset by volume and activity pressures. Please note that complementary revenues due fluctuate in our business and historically are more vulnerable to general economic conditions, but they also represent a smaller part of our revenue base. As I mentioned earlier, the Mimosa acquisition should add just under a point to our revenue growth in 2010. Combined with the estimated 1% benefit from the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar, we are projecting reported revenue growth to be in the 6% to 8% range for 2010. Let's turn to slide 13 for a look at revenue growth across our segments. Slide 13 highlights our expectations for internal growth rates across our three major business segments. For our North American Physical segment, which finished the year with a 3% internal growth rate, we are expecting 2010 internal growth to move up to the 4% to 5% range. This outlook reflects mid-single digit storage revenue growth gains, supported by improved complementary service revenue growth. These gains will be moderated by lower service activity levels and expectations for constrained shredding growth in the current environment. For our International Physical segment, we are projecting internal growth in the 4% to 6% range. 2009 was a good year in the International segment, supported by solid growth rates in core revenue, partially offset by pressures on our complementary services. We saw a solid revenue performance in our expansion markets and expect this to continue in 2010. For 2010, we are targeting continued solid core revenue growth rates in our International business, building on our momentum in these markets. Finally, with respect to our Worldwide Digital segment, we are targeting an internal growth rate of flat to 10%. We expect continued solid growth from our expanding eDiscovery business as we – but we will be working through the impacts of recent lower subscription sales in our storage growth. While it’s still too early to call – to plan for a turnaround, we have seen some positive factors with respect to Digital sales and remain confident that we can get this business on track towards strong long-term growth as the economy recovers. Slide 14 incorporates these projections to our overall guidance for 2010. Slide 14 summarizes our full year 2010 and Q1 outlook. Overall, we are now targeting 6% to 8% growth in reported revenues, including benefits from the Mimosa acquisition and a weaker U.S. dollar. We are raising our guidance in dollar terms and now expect 2010 revenues of between $3.185 billion to $3.255 billion. With respect to adjusted OIBDA, we are targeting 7% to 12% reported growth or $930 million to $975 million, reflecting continued margin gains and additional benefits from higher paper prices. These gains are partially offset by the dilutive impact of the Mimosa acquisition. Our capital expenditures of approximately $320 million include $30 million for real estate. The decrease from our preliminary forecast given on Investor Day last October is due primarily to lower expected real estate spending, benefits from our procurement initiative and refined spending plans in the context of the current growth outlook. In terms of free cash flow, we intend to build on our strong 2009 performance with goals for free cash flow before acquisition and real estate investments of $330 million to $370 million. The year-on-year growth rate for free cash flow is constrained by increase in cash taxes that we expect to be about $110 million in 2010. As you know, we've utilized nearly all of our U.S. federal NOLs and our cash tax rate is now approaching our book tax rate. For the first quarter, we are projecting revenues of $770 million to $790 million and adjusted OIBDA of $210 million to $220 million. This outlook reflects Q1 internal growth in the 3% to 6% range. As noted earlier, we expect our storage growth comps to be toughest in the first quarter, but these impacts should be offset by favorable comps on factors such as recycled paper revenues. Turning to slide 15, you can see our expectations for the P&L below the adjusted OIBDA line for the full year 2010. D&A expense is up modestly, reflecting the Mimosa acquisition and interest is flat compared to 2009. We are expecting our structural tax rate to be 40% for 2010. This rate is 2% higher than our 2009 structural rate, due primarily to the exploration of certain tax loss related to R&D credits and foreign income at December 31st, 2009. This 2% increase in our structural rate has a projected $0.04 impact on earnings for the full year. It's possible that this loss would be retroactively reenacted during the year. If that happens, we will adjust our structural tax rate accordingly. As Steve described earlier, adjusted EPS assumes asset gains and losses, other income expense and non-controlling interest to be zero. This will allow for greater year-on-year comparability. Our adjusted EPS calculation assumes 205 million shares outstanding. In summary, 2009 was a solid year as strong execution drove record profitability and free cash flow. Our business fundamentals are solid and despite the current economic headwinds, we remain confident in our long-term growth potential and expect to make progress in improving our growth trajectory in 2010. Our balance sheet remains strong and we are very well positioned financially to fund our growth agenda and support shareholder payouts. Thanks and now, I'll turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Brennan: Thanks, Brian and good morning, everyone. As Brian explained, our financial results for the quarter came in as expected. We had a good quarter, we had a good year, and we've done well. Our revenue growth was moderated by the economy and factors we've discussed on previous calls. But despite a tough selling environment, we managed well, applying discipline and focus to operating Iron Mountain with excellence. We advanced our strategic position and I'm very proud of the way the team delivered strong profit and cash flow gains across all segments of the business. On this call, I want to shed light on the current trends in our business and emphasize some key areas of focus for the year. I also, of course, will provide more detail on two strategic fronts, both announced in just the last two days. First, the advancement of our Digital business through the acquisition of Mimosa and second, our shareholder payout approach. Both are right up the alley of our strategy and I'll share those details in a few minutes. There are three things I want you to hear today. The first is about growth because while we are working through some economic headwinds, we are targeting an improved growth trajectory in 2010 and remain optimistic about Iron Mountain's growth potential going forward. The second key message I want you to hear is that we remain focused on managing our business with discipline and intent to leverage continued gains from our operational excellence initiatives to drive strong profits and cash flow this year and in the years that follow. The third message is that we are advancing our long-term strategic agenda, demonstrated by our investments in technology services. So let's go to the top of the agenda. Let's talk about growth and the trends in our business where we experience the most impact. Current growth trends are what we expected. You've heard me tell you on the recent calls that we anticipated pressure from the economy on our near-term growth rate. The economy took us from high-single digit growth to where we are now. You can see from our forecast that we expect improvements in our growth rate, but not a turnaround in 2010. As the economy improves, revenue should improve. In the meantime, we are aggressively getting after revenue growth with the same focus and discipline we applied to expanding margins in the last few years and I'm optimistic about our growth potential. A few things. First, there are positive factors on the growth front. Next, we are taking the right proactive steps to get after revenue. And third, we continue to expand our capability on a permanent basis. Let me cover all three. First, the positive factors on the growth front. Our international expansion markets have been posting solid gains. We see signs of improvement in technology sales. Now, it's still tough, but it's improving. And our DMS pipeline is growing. And although the sales cycle for DMS is a long sales cycle, this clear customer interest, which reinforces the fact that this is a big growth area where we have a unique value proposition. In addition to these positive factors, we are applying aggressive tactics to get after revenue now. We are not sitting back waiting for the economy to improve. The team that brought the operational excellence and the margin expansion that came with it, they are running well, we are pivoting our leadership into the – on to pursuit of our biggest revenue opportunities. We continue to get better at selling by aligning our sales force with key vertical segments to capture more opportunity within our existing accounts and we are supporting sales with targeted programs such as teaming with our real estate partners to get after net new business through that channel and others. These positive factors and proactive steps support my confidence in an improved growth outlook for 2010 and beyond. As we move forward, we'll also continue to improve our capabilities in areas that will drive strong long-term growth in our business. These include capturing large unvented opportunity in our core Physical business; growing new services, particularly DMS and Digital; and continuing international expansion in growth markets like Continental Europe, Latin America, and Asia. These areas of focus position us well for a return to our target growth rates as the economy improves. We are confident that we can improve our capability to sell in market just like we have improved our capability to operate the business in the last few years. So the first message is one of an improved growth trajectory. It's our top priority and we are getting after growth in an aggressive way. The second message that I want to reinforce today is one of operational excellence. As we advance our growth strategy, we will leverage the benefits of our operational excellence initiatives to drive continued strong financial performance. In 2009, despite revenue pressures, we achieved 14% growth in adjusted OIBDA on a constant currency basis with record capital efficiency and free cash flow. The team did a great job. Our goals for strong profit gains and cash generation in 2010 reflect that these gains are driven by sustainable initiatives and enhanced organizationally capability. I want to know we have substantial room to drive continued improvement. It's indicated in our operational priorities this year, which include the continued rollout of existing initiatives such as our transportation improvement and record center optimization programs to new markets; the expansion of our operational initiatives on a global basis, supported by a global – supported by a strengthened global support structure that we've put in place; and the rollout of new initiatives such as global procurement, which is supporting gains in areas like capital efficiency and operational uniformity further down into our business. This focus gives us the ability to invest against the initiatives, while we deliver strong financial results. So the first message is to reinforce our bias for growth, the second message is operational excellence bring sustainable benefits. Now, I want to talk to you about major advances to our strategy that we've been signaling for some time. As you know, our growth strategy is to focus on organic development of the core Physical business, complemented by the expansion of services, tied to the rapid growth of digital and hybrid records, all in the context of delivering strong financial results. The strategy has been on track for years and our conviction only grows as we extend our leadership in the market, as evidenced by this week's acquisition of Mimosa. We are really excited to have Mimosa – the Mimosa team join the Iron Mountain family. They are a great company, they complement our growth strategy and they fit well into our overall approach to M&A. Mimosa is a leader in enterprise-class content archiving. They have more than 1,000 customers and they are recognized by industry analysts as the fast-growing visionary archival solution. This solution complements our growth strategy. Their product works at the customer's site to provide storage of and access to e-mail and share point files. With Mimosa, Iron Mountain can now manage enterprise information wherever it resides, with the customer at their site or in our cloud. Mimosa is a great example of the type of acquisition that fits well in our growth strategy. The last major acquisition was Stratify in late 2007 and Mimosa is a technology acquisition similar to Stratify, Connected, and LiveVault in the following regard. They are leader in their segment, highly complementary to our existing business, they are moderately sized, meaning that we can integrate them well and it represents next-generation technology, giving us the ability to leapfrog in the marketplace. We continue to be very thoughtful as we add businesses to our portfolio, complementing our internal development efforts and our partnership initiatives. So that's Mimosa and I would like to welcome Ravi and his team to Iron Mountain. This morning, we also announced that our Board approved a new program to being returning capital to shareholders, comprised of $150 million share repurchase program and Iron Mountain's first ever dividend. These programs underscore the power of our business model and the confidence we have going forward in our growth agenda. Our profitability and cash generation has improved at an impressive rate. Strong cash flow gives us a strong balance sheet and we have the financial flexibility to initiate periodic share repurchases and pay quarterly dividends while continuing to invest in our growth agenda and pursue strategic acquisitions like Mimosa. We are here to drive strong growth over time. These actions by our Board demonstrate our confidence in the long-term growth prospects of the company and our commitment to delivering long-term value to our shareholders. So let me sum up. We are focused on strengthening our growth trajectory as a business. It's reflected in our goals for 2010 and the substantial long-term growth opportunity for our business. We intend to build on our increasing profitability and cash flows, leveraging sustainable gains in operational excellence as we go. And we are here to constantly advance our strategy as an information management services leader, positioning Iron Mountain for short, medium, and long-term success. So with that, I'd now like to ask the operator to open the lines for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of David Gold of Sidoti.
David Gold – Sidoti: Hi, good morning.
Bob Brennan: Good morning.
Brian McKeon: Good morning, David.
David Gold – Sidoti: Couple of things. First question, on the organic storage growth, as we start to think about that, it sort of sounds like feeling better and the guidance sort of brings up the lower end of maybe what you were thinking three or four months ago by a point. I guess, last year at I Day [ph], you spoke about three disparate trends, increased destructions, delayed sales, and reduced activity. And I guess just wanted to get a little bit of a better there for sort of which of them are either rolling off of change and enough to give you the extra little bit of confidence.
Brian McKeon: Yes, I think David, why don't I take initial cut on this? I'm sure Bob can add. The – we are in a similar place to where we were a few months ago in terms of our outlook and the trends, the improvement in the internal growth rate and some of that's driven by the favorable changes we've seen in factors like recycled paper pricing gives us more confidence at the low end of the outlook, but we are in a similar kind of growth range to where we were a few months ago. The destructions have, I would say, stabilized, but remained at relatively higher levels than historically. So some of those carryover impacts that we saw from the growth in destructions here during 2009 will put a little more pressure on the growth rate early in the year, but we think we will be looking at some better comparisons as we work through the year on storage. New sales, it takes awhile for any changes in our sales to work through our business and has continued to be a challenging selling environment, but as Bob noted and I'm sure he can add more to this, we are getting after that aggressively and hopefully, we can improve on that front going forward. So I would say the – in the immediate term, the – those trends are similar, we do think we can do some things to influence that positively as we move forward and obviously, if the economy improves, that will be a big help as well. The activity piece, David, is I would say is really less related to the – there is some impact on storage than it tends to have impact on our service revenues, but the economy continues to be soft and we factor that all in, we think we can still deliver solid growth and relatively improved performance and position ourselves well for when those economic factors improve.
Bob Brennan: Yes, I agree with you. I think the activities are tied to the economy. We are very much focused on improving our selling organization and they are doing a good job reacting to the current situation to drive more depth out of the accounts we have and get net new accounts and I had mentioned that in my comments. That's an area where our – I just – I like the way we are reacting, I like the way we are getting after it.
David Gold – Sidoti: Perfect. And then just one other, if I might. You had also mad some comments on the newer initiatives for the – in the record center optimization, et cetera and I was just curious, I know a few months ago, the comment was you are about halfway through. So just curious on update there or – so have we made any progress there in sort of what's the time frame for completing North America and, say, moving on to overseas?
Bob Brennan: So we've put in a global support structure so that we can export the North American playbook, and we've done to do – we have begun to do that in our larger markets and we take a market-by-market approach with each of these initiatives and it is – it's rolling thunder, right? So like global procurement is just starting, transportation improvements started, you heard me talk about that years ago and sort of pretty far along with transportation improvement, we are in the middle stages with the record center optimization, we are just beginning with global procurement. We see these as sustainable opportunities to continue to drive our profit performance out of the core Physical business.
David Gold – Sidoti: Got you. So just a time frame maybe for at least completing the North American portion?
Brian McKeon: I think we've got – we are well along with the North American initiatives, but we are obviously looking to – for a significant benefit on that front this year and we can – and we've got new wave of initiatives that I think will help us going forward. As Bob mentioned, procurement, we are looking at our go-to-market capabilities and think there is opportunities to be more effective and efficient on those fronts. And so we have additional ideas that we can apply. And so I think we are well along with some of the things we talked about, but we've got new things in the pipeline that should sustain these improvements going forward.
Bob Brennan: In other words, you don't see a completion date, David.
David Gold – Sidoti: Okay. It's a moving target.
Brian McKeon: It's how we are running the business. I think it's the key thing to understand.
David Gold – Sidoti: Got you. Fair enough. Thank you, both.
Brian McKeon: Thanks.
Bob Brennan: Thanks, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman – JPMorgan: Good morning, gentlemen. Good job. I want to talk about the implied EBITDA margin, middle of the range. In the first quarter, I think it's 27.6% compared to the just reported 29.5% and I just wanted to know what would be driving factors between first quarter EBITDA margins and fourth quarter EBITDA margins.
Brian McKeon: That's – it's principally seasonality. So if you look at – that would imply OIBDA growth ahead of revenue growth in the first quarter. So that would imply margin improvement and so – year-on-year. And so the difference is between Q4, we just have –there are some seasonality differences in our business, I'm just thinking offhand, in places like our Digital business, fourth quarter tends to be a high licensed software sales quarter, just energy – Steve is giving me some notes here. There are payroll taxes, there are some recognition of expenses and timing of when you – so there are some seasonality differences in our quarterly flows, but this is not a indication of a change in kind of our trajectory towards sustaining our margin improvements and building on them. And we did try to reinforce today, Andrew, some heightened disclosure on our segment performance and I just want reinforce, if you look at how we are performing by segment to where we are driving performance on a full-year basis improvement across our business. So we think we can build on these strong trends we've been driving.
Andrew Steinerman – JPMorgan: Right. And could you comment on first quarter implied internal growth? Would FX be about 1% and Mimosa would be less than 1% and so you've got to net those out from the middle of the rate to 8%?
Brian McKeon: Yes. No, the – I did mention in my comments that it implies internal growth of 3% to 6% and FX is a little more favorable in Q1, I think it's closer to 3% I believe, in just 2% to 3%. So it’s a little more favorable and there is limited impact from Mimosa in Q1 just given the timing of the close. So it's – 3% to 6% is the internal growth and I just wanted to highlight the – we will see our toughest comparison in storage comps in Q1 just given kind of the cumulative effect of what went on in 2009. So that growth rate will probably be a little bit below our full-year goal and – but we will see favorability from things like recycled paper, we will – their most stable compares we will see on that front in Q1. So net-net, it – we should have a good internal growth quarter.
Andrew Steinerman – JPMorgan: Right. And how do you see core service so far in the quarter?
Brian McKeon: I don't want to comment on in-quarter trends, but similar – we've seen similar trends in terms of pressure on activity levels. So it's – that's baked into our outlook for the full year and we haven't projected an improvement and we are working through that. It's the economy and hopefully, we will see improvement on that front as the economy gets better.
Andrew Steinerman – JPMorgan: Okay. It sounds like a great start. Thank you.
Brian McKeon: Thank you, Andrew.
Bob Brennan: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good morning.
Bob Brennan: Good morning.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: With regard to your comments just now, Brian, on storage being a little bit softer in the first quarter on the tough comp, should we see a significant variance in the internal growth rate, something perhaps outside of the 4% to 5% range for 2010 or are you going to be pretty tight quarter to quarter?
Brian McKeon: I would – I try not get into – trying – I'm trying not to get into like quarterly projections for components of our growth. I think we are – the – what we are trying to highlight is the 4% to 5% for the full year is obviously our goal. And I think in that context, Q1 is going to be tougher compared – I think we will have – hopefully – we will have easier comparisons as we work through the year. So I really don't want to get into – I guess the key point I want to make here is this isn’t a change in our business, this is a – it's the flow through of the effects that we talked about in 2009 that really kind of started after the first quarter or kind of accelerated post of the first quarter that stabilized, we are confident on our full-year outlook for storage growth. This isn't projecting improvement, it's more reflecting that we are going to see a easier comparison as we work through the year and it's just – the first quarter – the way things flow through our business, kind of the buildup of things like softer new sales and higher destructions, we are – we've got our toughest compare coming out of the blocks, but we're confident in the full-year number and that's what we are focused on.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Thanks. That's helpful and I just wanted a sense of magnitude. How are destructions coming along? I mean, is it – do we see the end of that anytime soon? I got the sense from the call that that's feeling a little bit better incrementally, but if you could take us a little deeper there?
Brian McKeon: I – Scott, I think it's stabilizing, right? And customers forecast that for us and so we did see a bolus as things worsen, we see it stabilizing now. I don't want to forecast a change in it, but as the economy improves, I would expect that to become less of an issue.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks.
Brian McKeon: And we should – I just want to comment. We should see naturally some benefit over time and that – this reflects to a degree of pent-up actions by customers to look at cleaning up their records and recognizing some savings and we will hopefully work through some of that and the – it's not something that we would expect to be an accelerating trend or an ongoing trend. We think that we will see an end to this, moderation, I should say, at some point.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Thanks. And can we get an update from you guys on pricing, how customers are reacting? It's been in place now, but you've increasing that for awhile and obviously, embedded in the guidance into 2010, but just how is that progressing on the customer front? Thanks.
Bob Brennan: Well, I think it's – the way to think about it, Scott, is how it's progressing on our front. We are getting better and more disciplined and smarter about this as we learn and it allows us to take a more methodical, careful approach that we – where we can drive sustainable benefits over time. So I would say that we are developing muscle memory around it.
Brian McKeon: Yes, I think there has been positive reaction from customers on the use of list price methodology and a discount-off list. I think it's a very clear pricing approach and that's lead to the right kind of discussions. It's obviously a tough economic environment, so we have lots of dialog with customers about how to help them be more efficient and – but our focus is to maintain discipline in our pricing and focus more on how we can add value to how they manage their records programs and –
Bob Brennan: Fundamentally focus on driving out costs.
Brian McKeon: Yes, and we feel good about how that's progressed. So we think we've got a good system in place, we think we can sustain that going forward and look, there is always things that we are working on on the margin and – but we think we take – we took a big step forward and we are in a better place and we have something in place now that we can sustain our performance for a long period of time.
Bob Brennan: Yes. We have learned lessons, we are not really going to discuss those in great detail, but we've learned as we've gone.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Okay. One final one if I could. Within SG&A, some investments in growth and then obviously productivity related – and you touched on that a little bit already. The question here is how much flexibility – do you look at a year, start the year and say, okay, here is what we are going to spend and it's pretty fixed and firm as you do it or is there a good bit of flexibility on what you do with the gas pedal as you move through the year based on perhaps the macro conditions and how that's affecting your top line?
Bob Brennan: So the way that we think about it is that the pencils never go down in planning, right? While we work from year to year on operating plans and performance, we are always focused on being adroit in how we manage the business and we have the capability to invest within the context of the range that we've set for our performance and that's – the key is to be disciplined within that performance range.
Brian McKeon: Yes, the thing I'd share is one way to think about this, there are a couple of components to our costs. One would be the SG&A as you discussed, which is we have a degree of flexibility and we are – of course, we will always look at that in the context of our business trends. Actually, the bigger lever here is the – that costs are directly related to our business. It provides services in our business and – rather than the SG&A, but the costs that support service delivery. And the thing I would highlight to you is just the capability that we've built in places like our North American organization. I mean, last year, we clearly had a big change in our growth outlook versus what we had expected given the economy and I think we demonstrated an ability to adapt quickly and adjust our cost structure to fit the new growth environment and deliver our profit objectives and so I think we have excellent capability to adapt our cost structure to changes in the growth outlook and we feel very confident in ability our – our ability to deliver our profit objectives because of that.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks.
Brian McKeon: All segments performed.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Excellent. Thanks, guys.
Bob Brennan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi: Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on the good results and guidance.
Brian McKeon: Thanks, Ashwin.
Bob Brennan: Thanks, Ashwin.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi: My question – my first question is on the CapEx outlook. Is it possible for you guys to break out the impact of higher shredding and destruction with freed-out space, because that might be viewed as sort of one-time in nature versus other initiatives which sort of have an ongoing benefit?
Brian McKeon: Yes. Let me try to tackle this. I – in terms of the reductions to our – we've obviously taken capital spending down a lot in the last couple of years. An element to that more recently has been a lower growth outlook and not having to add capacity. I wouldn't relate that, Ashwin, to destructions that really isn’t a material factor in terms of – it's more that as we look at our growth outlook and it's moderated, we look at the timing of when we need to add new buildings, add new racking, and we – we are not doing that at the same pace that we were before. So there is a benefit to that. I would say, however, though our outlook for 2010, if you take out real estate, our capital spending as a percentage of revenues will be about 9% thereabouts. That's consistent with our five-year goal. We may have some variation in this year-to-year, but we are building the capability we think to sustain our capital spending at those levels. So we don't think this is one-time and think we can sustain lower spending as a percentage of sales. That's our intent and hopefully we can continue to demonstrate through that through our good management and good performance.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi: Okay. Is it still a sort of 85-15 split, if you will, between growth and maintenance CapEx?
Brian McKeon: We – it's – we've moved away from percentage of total, because our total has come down, we've enhanced our disclosures around this a bit in our 10-K, we look forward to you seeing that. We estimate that maintenance capital is about 2% of our – 2% of revenues and that – we think that's the right way to look at it.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi: Okay. And buyback, that's a good announcement there. But any thoughts on pace of buyback, guidelines around that? When do you intend to finish it?
Brian McKeon: We are not going to be giving any specifics on the details of the buyback program, but we do want to reinforce that this gives us a flexibility to advance shareholder payouts and buybacks should that make sense and we certainly have plenty of financial flexibility to support a buyback program. So – but we won't be disclosing specifics of the program.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi: Okay. And last question on M&A. What should we expect going forward? Obviously, Mimosa seems to fit. But is there going to be a focus on specific verticals like public sector or maybe international markets or more digital, is it going to be more opportunistic? Can you – any – some thoughts on that would be great. Thank you.
Bob Brennan: Yes. Ashwin, it's – we focused on this from a strategic perspective and if you look at our strategy, it is about select international expansion and expanding our services specifically around Digital and DMS. And I think the past acts as a math, more than a compass as to what we will be doing, but the – Mimosa fits very well into our strategy and our M&A approach, to give you an example of the types of acquisitions that we think are appropriate from a Digital perspective. From a core Physical perspective in our North American markets, we feel that we have the footprint to execute.
Brian McKeon: And we will obviously be focused on making sure we integrate this acquisition well and demonstrate good performance to build confidence on continuing to deploy capital on that front.
Bob Brennan: And we are very excited to have the Mimosa team on Iron Mountain.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi: Okay, great. Thank you.
Bob Brennan: Thanks, Ashwin.
Brian McKeon: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Justin Hawk [ph] of Robert W. Baird.
Justin Hawk – Robert W. Baird: Good morning, guys.
Bob Brennan: Good morning.
Brian McKeon: Good morning.
Justin Hawk – Robert W. Baird: A quick question on the EBITDA guidance for 2010 and it looks like it's about $30 million higher at the midpoint. I guess – I was wondering if you could quantify how much of that is from scrap paper benefit and how much of this just from margin benefit.
Brian McKeon: Yes, it's actually about $35 million higher and roughly, the net effect of the recycled paper improvement is – it's – I'm just doing on a percentage basis, probably in the $15 million-ish type range. Just want to highlight a couple of things on recycled paper. Keep in mind, we did see some – when we gave the guidance, we had seen some improvement on paper pricing, it's obviously improved since then. The – it is – part of the reason that paper pricing is up is because recycled paper volumes are down. So there are some offsets to the revenue gains that we've seen just given – it’s a supply-demand imbalance, because recycled paper volumes are down, it is a key factor driving this, so there will be some offsets from the volumes being down. We do expect some pressure on service pricing that goes along with higher paper pricing competitively. Net-net, it is a positive factor, but it's – it's about 2 percentage points of a favorable benefit on the growth rate from where we were before. Keep in mind, on the OIBDA guidance, we did have an offset with Mimosa. There is some dilutive effect next year. So that was moving the other direction. But to your point, we did raise it about $35 million and raised the growth rate about 1%. So we feel positive about that development.
Justin Hawk – Robert W. Baird: Great. Thank you.
Brian McKeon: Thank you.
Bob Brennan: Thank you, Justin and thank you, everyone. We will talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Call Webcast. (Operator instructions) Mr. Golden, you may begin.
Stephen Golden: Thank you and welcome everyone to our 2009 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. After my announcement this morning, Bob Brennan will give a state of the company remarks followed by Brian McKeon, who will deliver the financial review. When Brian is complete, we will open up the phones for Q&A. At this time, I'd like to thank everyone who joined us for our Annual Investor Day event earlier this month. It's an event we certainly look forward to every year and hope you found the presentations both interesting and informative. We appreciate your support and as a reminder, an archived version of the webcast and the slide presentations are currently available on our website. In an ongoing effort to enhance our communication with the investment community, we recently undertook an audit of our IR website. As a result of that audit, we'll be adding new content to the site. The first items to be added are biographies for our board of directors, which can be found in the corporate governance section, and information with respect to our debt portfolio in the supplemental data section of the site. The debt information contained in this new posting is routinely disclosed in our earnings slides and periodic SEC filings.  However, we believe the central repository will prove useful to investors. The information presented is as of the end of the quarter and will only be updated along with our non-GAAP measures on a quarterly basis. Please watch for additional upgrades in the coming quarters. Per our custom, we have a user controlled slide presentation on the investor relations page of our website, at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to slide two, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2009 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide or our current report on Form 8-K filed on May 8, 2009 for discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statement. As you know, operating income before D&A or OIBDA and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments among others are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information in the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the investor relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. With that, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bob Brennan.
Robert Brennan: Because we're only three weeks from Investor Day, my comments today will be brief and I would like to start by re-emphasizing the key messages that we had on Investor Day. The first thing being that we have a very solid expanding foundation of business at Iron Mountain. It's a resilient business, it's diversified across geographies and product lines, and it's a business that continues to deliver solid growth. This is true across all three of our reporting segments, North American physical, international physical and worldwide digital, all of which are solid foundations. And we are building future growth on these solid foundations. The second key message, that we were seeking to convey a few weeks ago, that we continue manage well by applying both focus and discipline to our management cadence. We're driving productivity improvements and getting the higher returns that come with those. It's a functioning of focusing on operation excellence, which distinguishes us both competitively and in our results. This is a continuous improvement process and we continue to invest as a result of those improvements in both growth and returns. We are in no way mortgaging this business to benefit current results. This disciplined approach is serving us well in this environment and for the long-term. The third key message that we wanted you to hear was that we are pursuing substantial growth opportunities. We face a set of market dynamics that are fueled by trends which are big, long-term and inexorable. It's about information growth, regulation growth, litigation growth and what we see as an ongoing tightening of IT budgets for the purposes of [light-con]. The three major long-term growth opportunities we're pursuing are in our core physical business, our document management solutions business and in our digital business. In the core physical business, it's about selling more. This is a very large un-vended $9 billion market opportunity, where we are seeking to target new customers by segmenting our base and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customers. In document management solutions, the second area of our focus, it's a very large market that's measured in the tens of billions where we are really getting at the paper inefficiencies that exist in our customer systems and workflow. We have a unique competitive advantage here because we have the capabilities of both the physical handling and the digital handling of their documents and this crosses into both. And we have line of sight to our customer's inefficiencies by dent of already being their custodian for their information assets. And the third large market opportunity is in our digital business where we already have leadership in providing storage as a service. And again these are trend-favored markets where we compete effectively today as a result of the brand recognition we have, the existing customer base that we have and our expertise specifically around compliance. So given these growth opportunities, we continue to invest towards our growth potential. For example, when we isolate those growth opportunities, we see great opportunity to continue strengthening our ability of facing the market and going to market through our sales force, our marketing organization and our customer service organization and we will continue to strengthen that capability and invest. Now we do expect growth will moderate in the near-term, as we said a few weeks ago, because the economic factors continue to apply pressure. But we remain very optimistic about the long-term opportunity and we're pursuing that aggressively. So if you step back on the Investor Day messages, what we were really saying is that we have a great business and a great opportunity. Our foundation remains solid, continues to expand and our disciplined approach to management is driving strong performance. We're well positioned to capitalize on large market opportunities and we're investing according. So now let me shift gears and give you a brief overview of our Q3 performance. In a few minutes Brian is going to walk you through the financial details, but first let me go through a few key themes. First, Q3 was a good quarter. Our foundation remains solid and we continue to expand. Storage internal growth was 7% consistent with prior quarters.  Now as we move forward we do expect some moderation on storage growth given longer sales cycles and destructions are still higher than usual, again reflecting the current economic environment. The impacts from the economy continue to also pressure service revenue growth rates. We have lower activity rates and lower complimentary services.  This quarter we were also up against some tough comparisons, particularly with respect to fuel prices which peaked in Q3 2008, as well as paper prices. But despite these economic pressures on our revenue growth, we continue to deliver strong sustainable profit performance. Our focus on operational excellence drives OIBDA growth ahead of revenue growth. OIBDA was up 10% in Q3 on a constant dollar basis. We are very much on track for a strong full year performance and we're raising our full year OIBDA guidance. Our execution is also driving strong cash flow performance and we're raising our full year free cash flow outlook accordingly.  Now, in terms of our segment performance you'll hear some consistent themes from me. In North American physical business, we are focused on as you know on driving operational excellence with sustained storage growth and delivering strong profit performance through improving productivity as we go. In our international physical segment, we're building up the global foundation. We had solid revenue in the quarter. Good growth in continental Europe and Asia benefiting from growth investments that were made in these regions. We are making good progress against our strategic plans, which are really supporting improved performance where we're pursing North American-like returns over time, and worldwide digital is holding its own in a very difficult IT spending environment.  The business continues to face new revenue headwinds where there's pressure on areas such as license sales, and our selling cycles remain longer than they had been prior to the recession. Now our recurring revenue base cushions the economic impact of these longer selling cycles, and while it cushions the decline, it also moderates the recovery. Our e-Discovery business continues to perform well and we're excited and confident about the strategic position of this business and we're committed to building the important growth platform going forward.  So overall Iron Mountain continues to perform and the team is managing well in a tough environment. We remain on track to deliver solid financial performance in 2009 and we remain excited about the long-term potential for the business.  With that I turn the call over to Brian for more detailed review of our financial results and our outlook for the rest of the year.
Brian McKeon:  Q3 was another solid quarter for Iron Mountain. We continued to deliver strong year-on-year OIBDA growth despite economic impacts that are moderating top line gains. Excluding currency effects, revenues grew 2% and OIBDA grew 10% reflecting benefits from our continued focus on disciplined execution across the business. Overall, we're positive about our business performance and outlook and remain on track towards delivering strong full year financial results. Today we will review our quarterly results and provide an update on our cash flow performance, capital spending, and our current debt position. We'll also provide additional perspective on our 2009 guidance and the refinements we've made to some of its components, including an increase to our OIBDA and cash flow outlook.  Slide four highlights the key messages from today's review. As noted, Iron Mountain delivered continued strong OIBDA growth in Q3 despite difficult comparisons to Q3 2008 and economic pressures that constrain top line gains. Storage internal revenue growth remains solid at 7%, supported by international expansion market growth and continued performance from North America. These gains offset weakness in serviced revenues due to lower core activity levels and declines in complimentary service revenues. Service growth was also impacted by tough comparisons to higher priority levels for fuel surcharges and recycle paper pricing. Despite these impacts, we continue to deliver strong OIBDA performance at the high end of our forecasted range benefiting from improved storage gross margins and productivity gains. For the quarter, we delivered OIBDA growth at 6% on a reported basis and 10% excluding the impacts of foreign currency rate changes. As a reminder, 2% of this growth is due to the initial re-characterization of vehicle leases that we've discussed in prior conference calls. We also to continue to improve our cash flows and strengthen our balance sheet. We remain on track towards delivering record cash flows this year supported by discipline capital spending and have maintained strong liquidity and record low leverage ratios. Overall we remain on track for strong full year financial performance.  In terms of our outlook for the balance of 2009, we're refining our full year revenue guidance to reflect year-to-date results and raising our OIBDA in free cash flow guidance range to reflect our strong continued operating performance. I'll speak to this in more detail later in the presentation. Let's move on to looking at the details of our revenue growth performance on Slide five. Slide five breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service lines, as well as the impact of acquisitions in foreign exchange. As noted, our total internal growth for the quarter was 2% as storage gains were offset by pressures on service revenues. Storage revenues, which represent more than 55% of total revenues, continue to provide an expanding foundation for overall revenue performance.  Storage internal growth for the quarter was 7% supported by consistent performance in North America and strong growth in international expansion markets, particularly Continental Europe. As shared at Investor Day, we do expect some moderation in storage revenue growth in upcoming quarters reflecting impact from the longer sales cycles and continued higher destruction activity.  Core service internal growth was 1%. Gains were constrained by pressure on transportation and shredding service activity levels and significantly reduced fuel surcharges in Q3 of 2009. Excluding the impacts of the decreased fuel surcharge, core service internal growth was 4% in Q3. Core service revenue continued to be impacted by economic conditions and is a key factor in our moderated outlook for internal growth. Complimentary service revenue internal growth was minus 15% for the quarter within our forecasted range. Results reflect a $9 million year-on-year decline in recycle paper revenue and other impacts from economic factors which drove pressure on special projects fulfillment revenues and software license sales. Foreign exchange reduced reported revenue growth by 4% in the quarter, although trends on this front are improving and we should see moderately positive effects at current exchange rates as we move forward. Based on our year-to-date results and current trends, we're refining our full year revenue outlook. We expect full year internal growth to be about 3% at the low end of our previous 3% to 5% growth range. This change primarily reflects continued expected softness in service revenue given current economic conditions. Offsetting this impact we now expect foreign exchange to have a 4% to 5% negative impact this year. So our expectation for reported revenue growth is in a similar range down slightly for the year. Let's now turn to Slide six to review our P&L performance. Slide six compares the results for this quarter to Q3 of 2008. Overall improved storage gross margins and productivity gains supported continued strong bottom line performance. Our largest segment, North American physical, posted 1% total internal revenue growth. Solid storage internal revenue gains were offset by the decline in fuel surcharges, recycle paper prices, and lower service activity levels. The weakening of the Canadian dollar over the last year further reduced reported revenue growth in the segment. Our international physical business achieved 5% total internal growths supported by strong storage revenue gains, particularly in Continental Europe. The total internal growth rate was moderated by decreased complimentary service revenues, including impacts from the completion of a large European project in 2008. Reported growth was reduced by more than 15 percentage points due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to Q3 in 2008. As noted on previous calls, our international revenue and cost are aligned in local currencies and these changes don't impact the health of our business. Finally, our digital segment posted minus 1% internal growth. Our overall digital revenue gains continue to be constrained by pressure on new subscription sales and software license sales in the current environment. We expect the impact from software subscription sales will constrain digital recurring revenue growth heading into 2010. Sustainable productivity gains, particularly in our North American physical business, helped drive strong year-on-year improvement of 290 basis points in our gross margin. Higher storage gross margin in North America, aided by improved pricing, was a key factor supporting gross margin gains.  Our gross profit and gross margin also benefited from the $5 million reduction in rent expense due to the initial re-characterization of certain vehicle leases from operating leases to capital leases. SG&A growth was 4% in the quarter compared to prior year levels excluding the impact of FX changes. This modest growth reflects targeted initiative spending and the selective impacts for certain expense accruals.  OIBDA was $224 million for the quarter up 6%, including 2% of growth from the initial re-characterization of certain vehicle leases. OIBDA growth was reduced by 4% due to the year-over-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar in Q3 2009 compared to Q3 2008. Depreciation was $72 million and amortization was $9 million, in line with expectations reflecting continued capital spending controls. Depreciation grew $7 million versus prior year levels in Q3 primarily reflecting the additional depreciation associated with the re-characterization of vehicle leases. Operating income was $143 million for Q3 of 2009, up 5% versus the prior year. Excluding asset gains and losses, operating income grew 4%. Moving on with our review of Q3 P&L performance, slide seven bridges our Q3 operating income to net income and EPS results. Operating income for the quarter was up 5% to $143 million on a reported basis. Our Q3 interest expense was flat compared to Q3 of 2008. We continued to achieve interest savings driven by lower debt levels and reduced interest rates. These gains were offset in Q3 by additional interest expense related to our recent offering as we carried both the 8-5/8 funds and the new 8-3/8 funds for about a month during the call process to retire the 8-5/8 funds in September. Other expense for the quarter was $1 million compared to $16 million in Q3 of 2008. Included in other expenses quarter is a $3 million early debt extinguishment charge related to the retirement of the 8-5/8% notes which were partially offset by modest FX gains. As a result, we reported net income attributable to Iron Mountain for the quarter of $43 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Impact and net income this quarter was an effective tax rate of 47%. While changes in foreign exchange currency rates within the quarter had minimal effect, other discreet tax items added a net $6 million into our Q3 2009 book tax provision and reduced earnings by about $0.03 per diluted share. These discreet items include true-ups based on our filing of our U.S. Federal State in certain foreign tax returns and related foreign tax credits and interest in our tax reserves.  In Q3 the impact of foreign exchange rate changes increased our effective tax rate by one point. Other discreet tax items such as I've just described increased our effective tax rate by an additional 10% in the quarter. For the quarter our tax rate before the impact of foreign currency rate changes and other discreet items was 36%. This was slightly lower than forecast in order to bring our year-to-date tax rate before impact of foreign currency rate changes and other discreet items to 39%. Currently, forecasting our tax rate before the impact of foreign currency rate changes and other discreet items for 2009 to be approximately 39%. Let's turn to slide eight to look at our year-to-date results. Turning to slide eight, you can see that our Q3 results continue the trends we've seen throughout 2009. Overall, we continue to drive strong operating [profit] performance despite economic factors that are constraining revenue growth. Internal revenue growth is currently at 3% for the year-to-date supported by storage revenue internal growth of 7%, which is offsetting pressures on certain activity-based core revenues and complimentary service revenues. We continue to leverage a disciplined approach to deliver strong sustainable profit results. Productivity gains and improved pricing in North America are key factors supporting a 290 basis point improvement in gross profit. Combined with controlled overhead spending, this has resulted in 320 basis improvement in our year-to-date OIBDA margin. Net income for the first nine months of 2009 was $160 million compared to $81 million for the same period in 2008. 2009 year-to-date EPS is $0.78 per diluted share. The key factors driving improvement in net income and EPS results are higher operating income and the impact of foreign currency changes on other income and expense and on our effective tax rate. For the first nine months of 2009, FX changes resulted in $24 million of other income and associated tax benefits. These gains have been partially offset by the $8 million of additional tax expense related to other discreet tax items. Combined, these factors have added about $0.08 to our year-to-date EPS results. In 2008, the impact of foreign currency rate changes on other expense and effective taxes resulted in a $0.16 reduction in diluted EPS for Q3 year-to-date. Adjusting both years EPS results to exclude these factors, comparable EPS has increased 26% year-to-date. Let's shift now to reviewing drivers of our cash flow performance. Slide nine summarizes our capital spending for the quarter. It highlights our year-to-date results compared to the full year 2008 amounts and our current 2009 outlook.  For the first nine months of 2009 we've incurred $198 million of CapEx including $19 million for real estate. Consistent with prior years, we have a heavier level of capital spending scheduled later in the year. Based on our most recent outlook for 2009 execution, we're lowering our capital expenditure guidance to $360 million. We expect to spend about $10 million less than previously forecasted for real estate, and we expect some additional efficiencies for projected timing of project spending. Note that these changes should not impact our 2010 preliminary outlook for capital spending in the range of $380 million. We remain on track towards record capital efficiencies in 2009 and look to build on that progress next year while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long-term return improvement. Let's now move on to slide ten and look at free cash flow for the quarter. Slide ten highlights our year-to-date cash flow performance compared to the same period in 2008. For the first nine months of 2009 free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $233 million. The year-on-year increase in free cash flow was supported by higher OIBDA and disciplined control of capital expenditures. Based on our strong year-to-date operating performance, we now expect free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate for the year to be approximately $240 million to $270 million. This will result in a strong improvement over record 2008 levels reflecting continued benefits from our efforts to improve profitability and capital efficiency. Now let's turn to slide 11 to review our debt statistics. Our focus on cash flow improvement is supporting continued strengthening of our balance sheet and liquidity. As a reminder, in Q3 we issued $550 million of 8-3/8 notes due 2021 at a price of 99.625 and used the net proceeds to retire our 8-5/8 notes due 2013 and pay down our revolver. As a result, our debt portfolio at the end of the third quarter was in a very strong position. Our weighted average interest rate is 6.9% and we're 83% fixed. Maturity is now at 8.4 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. Consolidated leverage at the end of Q3 is now at 3.4 times at the low end of our new target range of 3.5 to 4.5 times OIBDA and substantially below our 5.5 times bank covenant limit. As we've discussed in the past, our business will naturally deliver in the absence of meaningful acquisition spending. Benefits from strong operating cash flows and limited acquisition activity over the last two years have produced significant improvements in leverage ratios and liquidity. We currently have $449 million in cash and $620 million in additional borrowing capacity.  We have a very strong balance sheet and we're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. While we maintain a solid operating outlook, we anticipate maintaining a conservative approach to cash management in the current environment.  This concludes our review of Q3 2009 results. In summary, we're positive about our results. We continue to make progress in strengthening our business foundation globally while delivering strong financial performance. Let's now turn to slide 12 to review our updated financial guides for Q4 and the full year 2009. Slide 12 summarizes our full year 2009 and Q4 outlook. As noted, we've refined our full year revenue range to $3 billion to $3 billion 20 million to reflect year-to-date results. With respect to OIBDA we're raising our guidance range to $850 million to $865 million, reflecting our continued strong operating performance. This range implies 12% to 14% constant currency growth for the year. As a reminder, included in OIBDA for 2009 is about $20 million of reduced rental expense related to the re-characterization of our vehicle operating leases to capital leases. This change adds about 3% to our 2009 OIBDA growth rate. Offsetting the reduction in our renter expense are increases in our depreciation and interest expense. As such, there will be limited impact from this change to net income.  As noted, we're lowering our capital expenditure forecast to $360 million for the year including about $45 million for real estate. For the fourth quarter we're projecting revenues of $766 million to $786 million and OIBDA of $212 million to $227 million. Turning now to slide 13 you can see our updated expectations for the P&L below the OIBDA line for the full year 2009. As we've just discussed, our OIBDA outlook is in the range of $850 million to $865 million. Our outlook for D&A remains at about $320 million and interest expense is up slightly from last quarter due to the impacts from our Q3 refinancing activities. As a reminder, we don't forecast other income and expense or non-controlling interest so the amounts that you see here are the year-to-date actual results. Likewise, with respect to our tax provision, we've assumed a 39% structural rate plus the actual impact of discreet items recorded in the first nine months of 2009. These expectations yield EPS in the range of $0.99 to $1.03 per diluted share assuming 204 million shares outstanding. As a reminder, our year-to-date results include impacts to other income and expense in our effective tax rate from changes in FX rates since the end of 2008 and other discreet tax items. Combined, these factors increase net income attributable to Iron Mountain by $16 million or about $0.08 per diluted share. Adjusting EPS for 2009 and 2008 to exclude these factors, this outlook implies comparable EPS growth of 18% to 23%. That concludes my opening remarks. We'll now open the lines for Q&A.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first call comes from Andrew Steinerman.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan:  I'd like to start out, Brian, with just a big picture question about free flow and growth here. Obviously, this a year for free cash flow and you made your CapEx comment, but it also is a year where growth has decelerated. My question is as you look further out and growth reaccelerates into next year and beyond, do you feel like that will be a drag on cash flow?
Brian McKeon : No, Andrew, I think we're confident in our outlook. Obviously, at Investor Day we shared a multiyear view on this and that view incorporated the expectations for 2010 with some of the moderate improvement we're expecting on the growth fronts and obviously an improvement in growth [home stat] as we work through the economic downs that we're seeing currently.  And even with that improvement, we're targeting continued capital efficiencies and continued improvement in our cash flow. So, we think that we've got that reasonably figured into our long-term outlook. As we've often discussed there are a number of things that will aid our cash flow growth as we move forward in addition to the discipline that we've been applying.  We do expect to drive more growth from less capital intensive services. Areas like pricing are contributing more of our revenue growth over time than they have in the past, that's a positive factor in our business. So, this is not a short-term benefit from some change in volume, this is primarily driven by just increased discipline and focus and a real strategic emphasis on this as a key part of our financial strategy.  
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan: My second question is about the preliminary 2010 outlook, which had a lot of different components in it given an Analyst Day, including 3% to 6% internal growth for 2010. I just wanted to make sure that you remain comfortable with the preliminary outlook that you gave for 2010 realizing it's still a little bit of a distance away. 
Brian McKeon: We're not going to up update anything formally today but, obviously, it was just a few weeks ago and we're comfortable that that's a good range. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird. 
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird & Company: I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the complimentary services, the growth rates there have been bouncing around a little bit, down call it roughly 15% then down six and now down roughly 15% again. I guess are things actually decelerating there sequentially, because I think the comp was actually easier especially since I think scrap paper prices are actually increasing sequentially. I just want to get a little bit more of a flavor as to what's going on in that business. 
Robert Brennan: In terms of color, Andrea, the thing to know is that this is a lump year business. This is a more variable business for us than our storage business, right, it's the services on top of it and projects get delayed quarter-to- quarter. We do see the pipeline improving. I feel very confident about our ability to grow that business as economic conditions stabilize. But it is lumpy from quarter-to-quarter.  
Brian McKeon : Andrea, we've seen year-to-date performance in complimentary revenues in line with our forecast. In the second quarter we did have benefit from a big license sale reinforcing the point that Bob's making is that you do see some quarter-to-quarter swings on this. But it's been consistent with what we had expected and we do expect continued pressures on the more discretionary revenue front until we see clearer signs of improvement in the economy. 
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird & Company: Just a question on the overall internal revenue guidance coming in at the lower end, is there anything that actually came in incrementally worse than you had been expecting or is it just a matter of we're at the lower end of the range just because things just hadn't accelerated or improved as fast as you would have thought? 
Brian McKeon : We've seen a continued pressure on the service activity lows. Obviously our year-to-date growth is 3%. We've seen the last couple quarters a continued pressure on we noted transportation activity, shredding activity, it's general economic just how much folks are pulling their records back and forth from their record centers, as well as – it's interesting –  
Robert Brennan: It's also the reflexes of the customers. If they historically wanted same day delivery, they are now okay with –  
Brian McKeon : Premium services people are focused on that trying to manage that more tightly so that is the key factor. I think the other elements are consistent with what we've been highlighting.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh – Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh – Credit Suisse: Obviously, the storage growth picked up nicely sequentially the storage from six to seven and I know it seems like there are still some challenges there from a macro perspective. Can you help us kind of frame out the range your thinking about in that business? 
Brian McKeon : I think obviously, we're dealing with trends that we've seen in the last few quarters related to delays in sales cycles and higher destruction levels, which historically for the company you see that periodically, but I think the economic conditions continue to push companies to take big steps to say how might I save money and that's pushing them to consider destruction programs.  So, we know that those factors, as they flow over and start getting incorporated in the underlying volume growth they are going to moderate our growth rate. I think it's a reasonable expectation to see storage growth in the mid single-digit range in the next few quarters and it's still solid. It's still positive, but it's not going to be at the higher rates we saw at the end of last year driven by these economic factors. 
Robert Brennan: I pointed out, Kevin, at Investor Day in just one comment so I just want to emphasize it here is that we help customers with this. We go to them proactively. They're looking to have lower total program costs. We're obviously not interested in lower prices, but we're able to help them lower their costs by getting after what they can destroy. And so, we're in many cases self-inducing this because it helps our customers lower their program costs and without lowering our prices and it's useful for them in this timeframe and that's part of what we're doing is [smart holding]. 
Kevin McVeigh – Credit Suisse: Can you just remind us, obviously, there's a benefit from the destruction, where that's reflected across the three components? Would that be more in the storage itself or in the other parts of the business? 
Brian McKeon : It will come in the core service revenues and so that's actually mitigating some of the activity pressures that we're seeing.
Kevin McVeigh – Credit Suisse: We're at a 29.3% EBITDA margin and really its part of a trough of a cycle. That's at the trough. And I wonder are there any thoughts and kind of targeted EBITDA margins as we think about the business going forward? 
Robert Brennan: Kevin, that's just not how we manage the business. It's not how we think about it internally and we resist talking about it externally as well. 
Brian McKeon : We obviously provide outlook on what we think our OIBDA growth can be over time relative in our revenue growth and implied its continued moderate margin gains over time. I think to Bob's point we're going to look at maximizing our business potential and we do like having that discipline across each of our business segments to say we want you to grow profits faster than revenue as a discipline and we'd like to deliver that as a company, but I think we don't have an absolute margin target.
Robert Brennan: Right because you would do things like moderate how you would pursue DMS deals because it would take down OIBDA in a given quarter. That doesn't make sense if it's a good economic opportunity. 
Brian McKeon : Kevin, obviously our preliminary guidance for 2010 would imply that we're going to keep on this path and make continued strides. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: With the state of the economy being such a hot debate, especially the past week, anything you've gleaned during the month of October since the Investor Day on whether things are improving, anything interesting that's come up in customer conversations recently? 
Robert Brennan: Vance, you see bright spots in certain parts but there's still just a general tone of cost cutting as people are preparing 2010 budgets. They're trying to figure out how they can save money, so there's still amongst our customers this where can we save?  At the same time we're seeing a big pickup in the pipeline. A lot of the things that get deferred throughout this year are starting to build and people can't put off investments and IT infrastructure forever. They can't. So it's a mix. There's still a tremendous just undertone of just wanting to save money, but our pipeline's improving in part because it had been backing up. 
Brian McKeon : What we see internally is a lot of interest in more dialogue with customers for bigger ways for us to help them manage records, which plays in very well to things like our DMS Pro strategy. But I think at the same time, I think Bob mentioned as I did, there's more people involved with saying no and there's more of a tendency to delay these decisions. So we're hopeful but we haven't seen the improvements yet.
Robert Brennan: The good news is our value proposition leads with saving money. But I was at a customer last week where we can save them a lot of money through next year, but they still have to – there's just more people involved in that decision than there would have been even a year ago.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Regarding just a couple of external factors, could you provide a little color on how recycled paper prices are tracking most recently, since that can change quickly, and similarly, any thoughts on how fuel prices are impacting the business this far into the quarter?
Brian McKeon: First on recycled paper, we've seen improvement on that front. The market is now in the $150 to $160 range. When we met a few weeks ago at I-Day it was closer to the $130 range. So that's obviously picked up. There's demands improved in Asia. It's interesting there's sort of a supply demand dynamic going on where there is less recycled paper being generated and reasonable demand from Asia. So you've got a bit of an imbalance there that's helping to support higher prices in the near-term. So that's a positive factor. I think it's important to keep potential benefits like that in context for our business. Recycled paper is about 2% of our revenue. While the market pricing may be up, we are planning for continued pressure on service and activity levels, so that'll offset some of those gains. And on balance it's a positive factor but I just want to be clear that it's likely to be moderated by other effects.
Robert Brennan: So I mean keep in mind, Vance that as the price of paper goes up with the smallest competitors in local markets, the price of service goes down. So there's a Ying and Yang here.
Brian McKeon: On your second question, the energy costs really haven't been a major impact on our business. We've seen some efficiencies on the transportation side they continue to trend in the 3% range for our business. We had some decreases in fuel surcharges which offset some gains in the efficiencies so net-in-net it hasn't been a major driver of our margins but relatively more favorable, if that continues that'll help us a bit.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: With the consolidated leverage target of 3.5 to 4.5, presumably you'd like to be in that range over the long term. Any thoughts on how you'll get there or how soon you want to move to that range? Or for the time being, will you be happy to remain below the targeted range? 
Brian McKeon: You know what we're committed to leverage as a part of our capital structuring approach and at the same time we're okay with being relatively more conservative in the near-term, we're okay with temporary moves out of range. So I think it's something we'll continue to monitor and we're okay with being a bit low in the current environment. And over time obviously acquisitions are something that we are interested in strategically and if we don't have opportunities on that front we'll look at other vehicles to make sure we have an appropriate capital structure.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Gold – Sidoti & Company.
David Gold – Sidoti & Company: I guess looking at storage picking up sequentially and then you pointing to sort of mid single-digit growth from here on out over the next few quarters, can you just give a little bit more of a sense – I know you pointed to a couple of factors, but what are you guys basically looking at that isn't showing just yet in the numbers?
Brian McKeon: Well, one thing to highlight, David, is we obviously round our numbers and this was a soft seven, if you will, so it's not all that different in terms of the trends. And we even outlined the key factors are it's just the flow through effect of some of the delayed sales and the higher destructions. It takes a little time for that to flow through. We did see continued higher destructions in the quarter and.  And I also highlighted, it's a smaller part of the equation, but the digital business the slowdown in subscription sales, that typically for us has been a real positive factor and strengthening in the growth rate because that's a high growth area. And when you don't have that growing at the same kind of rate, it doesn't give you the upside benefits. So those are all the factors. I don't want to cause undue concern. We're talking about some moderation but still solid growth and not a significant change from where we've been [turning].
Operator: Your next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup.
Phil Stewart for Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: This is Phil Stewart on for Ashwin. I just wanted to ask about the international internal growth that seems to have held up better than North America. Can you just go through some of the differences there?
Robert Brennan: Fundamentally, the major markets that we're operating in there, the U.K., Continental Europe, we've been investing in that business. And hopefully, as you've seen if you look back over the last few quarters, we see continued improvement out of our international segment. They've really turned a corner in their performance and we expect them to pursue North American-like returns over time. We should feel really good about that business and the way the team's improving performance.
Brian McKeon: Yes, we try to highlight the progress in the expansion market. So Continental Europe, Latin America as well were key contributors to the improvement that we've seen on the growth side, and there are similar factors in backing international and markets like the U.K. The trends that we're seeing in the U.S. are similar to what we see in the U.K. But I think, as Bob said, on balance we've got good growth from expansion markets and in a good place where we think we can drive good profit performance as well as moving forward. They're doing a good job. 
Phil Stewart for Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: On the preliminary 2010 guidance, given the raised OIBDA range for 2009, is 6% to 11% growth still achievable or should we look at the absolute range that you provided?
Brian McKeon: We look at it from a growth rate point of view, so we're not updating formally today, but our intent would be to grow in a similar range off of our forecast this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer Funds
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer Funds: Going back to the question on storage and you mentioned it's going to be mid single digits, I know you're asking to predict the future here, but do you see that persisting it sounds like through this quarter and into the beginning of next year? How much visibility to you have into how that's going to trend? And then second part of that question is, is that predominantly commentary associated with North America? And then types of trends you're seeing are they consistent globally with North America or is there any divergence of the two in storage? 
Robert Brennan: North America and the U.K. perform in a similar fashion. Outside of that, there isn't a lot of similarity. It's essentially the way we're investing in the expansion markets that Brian just mentioned.
Brian McKeon: We have visibility into the next few quarters and because it's predictable with an understanding. We've consistent trends on things like incoming volume on storage and we obviously know what the flow through effect of things like net sales will be. I would say that that trend can change.  It doesn't change quickly, so I think our visibility is more over the next few quarters and that's all we're trying to highlight. There's going to be some moderation and it's entirely consistent with the guidance that we provided at I-Day. That's why we're in that 3% to 6% range in part is the factors that we're highlighting that we do expect some moderation in the growth rate as we head into next year.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer & Company: Could you guys address a little bit on the vertical? Do you serve health care, legal, etc.? Just any trends you're seeing between those and financial services, obviously. Any pickup in financial services, for instance just off late trends that might be noting?
Robert Brennan: Our largest customers in financial services we're actually highly engaged in helping them reduce their capital expense in favor of paying us as they go. So I feel very good about the biggest customers in that segment. There's really no discernible change when you get outside of the top 20, but we feel very good about our engagement with the top accounts in that space. Health care, as you know, there's an awful lot of activity around how vendors can work together to essentially get at this acute problem and the amount of money that's going to it. I would say that the pipeline doesn't really for me act as a predictor of our results. There's an awful lot of interest in proposals and that sort of thing. We're seeing very good tracking in our medical image archive business, but it's a small business still and we're building it as a flywheel but we continue to sign a lot of contracts there. A lot of activity in health care it doesn't necessarily come through the pipeline as readily as it would in financial services. I actually feel pretty good about the way our biggest customers are behaving in financial services. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Franco Turrinelli – William Blair & Company.
Franco Turrinelli – William Blair & Company: I wanted to start with the worldwide digital side of the business and maybe just help me understand a little bit or remind me a little bit how that is composed because that I would think is an area where your storage business would be growing pretty fast just due to the proliferation of digital records. But obviously there is other things going on in there including software and other stuff that can limit the internal growth. Can you drill down in worldwide digital a little bit more for me?
Robert Brennan: So worldwide digital is comprised of we have the backup in data protection segment, which constitutes the LiveVault and Connect acquisitions. We have an archival business and we have an eDiscovery business. The storage comes off of the first two and new sales are very tough in that environment right now and you can see that in our growth rate.  The sales cycles are longer, IT purchases are deferred. I spend a lot of time with CIOs and I can see just pure companies and how they're really delaying and deferring IT investments. I think a quick anecdotal survey would be just check with any CIO right now and see what their budget growth is year-on-year and it's down in absolute terms. An easy place to defer is on incremental storage and we're seeing the net effect of that in our revenue cycles and that is really a function of new revenue. 
Franco Turrinelli – William Blair & Company: So even though there is a component of that revenue that's related to volume of storage you're saying that people are kind of constraining the growth of that storage volume even if more records are out there. Is that the way to understand it? 
Robert Brennan: Yes and, Franco, it's happening both on a subscription basis and a licensed basis. If you look at the results of the pure storage providers into the market they're actually going backwards in absolute terms. The easiest proxy for this is to look at the results of the big storage providers because our biggest competition in this business is people doing it for themselves by buying storage, and you can see that they're buying less and less of it and we're seeing the effect of that. It's not as dramatic with us because of the recurring revenue base and the recovery won't be as dramatic. 
Franco Turrinelli – William Blair & Company: The other question that I have for you and this is kind of a big picture question. I'm really interested by this decoupling in a sense between core services growth and storage growth. As you know, I've covered the company for over a decade and generally we've seen fairly good correlation between core services and storage with core services actually averaging slightly higher than storage.  And you partially answered the question by talking about transportation shredding, the impact of fuel surcharges and stuff. But I'm curious if you think that there is something more fundamental going on here or if this is a temporary thing. And if it is a temporary thing, is this just a deferral or is there something more fundamental than a deferral? 
Robert Brennan: Let me tell you how I think about it, Franco. The strategy if you back way out is to get storage and drive services on top of that storage. But one of our fundamental value propositions is to help customers get rid of information.  When we go in our value proposition is to actually lower your costs associated with this stuff. Most companies save much more than they need to save and that we end up with more storage as a result but it's really getting at their inefficiencies and our goal is to keep adding more services on top of storage. That's our fundamental value proposition but it's all driven to reduce cost and in many cases that means lowering their cost of storage without lowering our price. 
Franco Turrinelli – William Blair & Company: I guess where I'm not sure that I understand the impact of that is whether or not – and again with not a quarterly outlook but with a multiyear outlook. Should we think of services returning to being inline with or above storage growth, or are we now in a stage of the business where services will actually remain below storage growth. 
Brian McKeon: Are you referring to core services?
Franco Turrinelli – William Blair & Company: I am. I'm sorry I was imprecise. I was referring to core services only, I apologize. 
Brian McKeon: We do think over time our core services growth should be at or above our storage growth that's our intent, obviously. Areas like shredding, Franco, are a bigger part of the business that's a key growth area. And the factors that are pressuring in the short-term if you really look at it is activity levels its people are swapping out premium activity for standard activity. There is 10% unemployment.  There are records that are sustaining in our facilities and natural volume from businesses but there's less business activity going with those records in the short-term. So it's clearly, from our point of view, an economic impact and our strategy over long-term should support higher services growth. 
Robert Brennan: Actually as the economy rebounds. 
Brian McKeon: This is clearly unusual. We didn't anticipate – the changes have happened relatively quickly and it's something that we didn't anticipate which is why we have a lower growth outlook than we did when we came into the year. But we don't see this as a secular or strategic change in the business.  I think that concludes the call today. 
Robert Brennan: Yes, thanks very much again for attending Investor Day a few weeks ago. We very much appreciate your support and your time today on the phone. Enjoy the rest of your day. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain second quarter 2009 earnings call and webcast. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn today's call over to Stephen Golden, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Stephen Golden:  Thank you and welcome everyone to our 2009 second quarter earnings conference call. After my announcement this morning, Bob Brennan will give his state of the company remarks, followed by Brian McKeon who will deliver the financial review. When Brian is finished, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. We certainly had a busy June this summer, meeting with both equity and credit investors in Chicago, L.A., London and New York. We'd like to thank you all for taking the time to meet with us and we certainly appreciate your council and continued support. I'd also like to ask you to mark your calendars as our 12th Annual Investor Day will be held on Tuesday, October 6, 2009 in New York City. This year we will be holding the event in the Hudson Theater in the Millennium Broadway Hotel on 44th and 45th. Stay tuned. We'll be releasing more information as it becomes available. The best way to stay informed is to sign up for email alerts at the investor relations page of our website. Per our custom, we have a user controlled slide presentation on the investor relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2 of that presentation, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notable our outlook for our 2009 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our current report on Form 8-K filed on May 8, 2009 for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements.  As you know, operating income before D&A, or OIBDA and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments among other metrics are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information in the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the investor relations page of our website as well as in today's press release. With that, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bob Brennan.
Robert Brennan: Thanks Stephen. Good morning everyone. Iron Mountain's business remains strong. We continue to deliver stolid results and we expect that we can sustain good performance going forward. Our business is performing very well in this recession as evidenced by the fact that growth is solid and core revenues are expanding with core growth of 6% and internal growth of 4%. We will be below the aggressive targets we set heading into 2009, but we feel good about the expansion of our business and our prospects going forward as evidenced by the fact that our bottom line is very strong with OIBDA up 17% for Q2 on a constant dollar basis, and 19% for the first half on a constant dollar basis. As Brian will explain in a few minutes, our cash flows and our balance sheet also continue to strengthen. As many of you know, our strategy is to optimize our core business while investing in growth. This strategy is in full force as we manage to achieving our full year targets. Let me review the business by segment, beginning with our largest and best performing business, the North American physical business. North America has been working on an agenda of pursuing growth while increasing returns since we integrated the offsite data protection and hard copy records management businesses in 2005 under Harry [Epinhausen's] leadership and they're doing a great job pursuing both growth and productivity. Let me start with the growth front. We think about growing the business of the North American physical business through vertical segmentation and through the introduction of new services. I'll just describe a few of the key verticals.  Financial services is a very large market for us where there's obvious pressure to reduce costs, but we also have a tremendous amount of opportunity as we continue to help our customers in this sector manage through industry consolidation, litigation and the increasing amount of regulation that they face. During the quarter we actually landed two nationwide shredding deals in this space, both in the low seven figures on an annual basis. The health care market is also an important market and a large sector for us, and this is obviously an industry that faces acute records management problems and there's a lot of attention and money going to this market. We've had a dedicated organization for some time and have a very broad service line across this function.  So whether it's active file management for a person's medical records, all the way through to the image archive that occurs in a radiology department, on an in sourced or out sourced basis, we have a lot to offer that industry as it tried to grapple with a very large problem associated with records management. From a government perspective, this is an area we've been investing for a few years with a dedicated organization and if you're doing business with the U.S. Government today, there's a new set of rules around how you must comply with the storage and protection of information. Some of that is related to facilities, and we've already made investment in compliant facilities that are beginning to fill up where we fill very good about the potential going forward. Retail is another segment that we actually got into as a result of entering the shredding business earlier this decade. During Q2 we actually won one of the largest retailers in the world with a nationwide shredding win that covers 2,000 locations. This is a customer that we had won from a records management perspective years ago, and represents the opportunity for us to increase our share of wallet with that customer. That will give you a sense for how we're thinking about some of the most important verticals segments. In terms of new services, you've heard me talk about DMS for a couple of years now and we've been building up that business. We had some key wins in North America in Q2. The National Bank of Canada was faced with new legislation and we were able to help them with an image on demand solution for the work flow that was affected by that legislation, helping them be more compliant as well as save money. They've been a customer of our since 1996, so they knew we were very familiar with how to adjust their work flow. Navistar is a long term customer where we have actually noticed a spike in their retrieval activity and after inquiring about that, found out it was related to a specific legal matter. We were able again to apply our image on demand capability to help them with that matter and now are helping them across the entire legal function. I do want to be clear though, make no mistake about it. It is harder to sell these days, but our offerings are matching up well with the market needs that we see. Our pipeline continues to expand and we remain sharply focused on growing our core business as a top priority. We are also focused on optimization of this business through improving productivity, and there's two areas I just want to briefly highlight. One is record center optimization. This is where we take a market by market approach to improving work flow, and by focusing on improving work flow, it has the benefit of producing higher service gross margins, higher service quality and higher employee satisfaction. We're also focused as you know on extracting value for the investments that we've made through a pricing excellence program and we continue to build systems and processes to sustain pricing for the very long term so that we can capture value for the investments we've made on a sustainable basis. So North America is doing a good job pursuing their agenda of growth and productivity. That being said, we are seeing some pressure on the margin. Higher unemployment obviously means fewer employees which results in fewer transactions. Lower retail sales means fewer receipts. It takes longer for our shredding bins to fill up which means less frequent bin tips.  And activity levels in general have moderated. We also apply some of our pressure ourselves. We help our customers lower total programming costs, and sometimes that means that you'll see more destruction volume and this has a dampening effect on near term volume, but it positions us well with the account for future growth and helps us lower our customer's total program costs. But even when you take these factors into account, the North American physical business is doing a great job generating higher returns as we pursue a long term growth agenda and we expect it to sustain momentum in this business for the very long term. So let me move on to the international segment of our business. I'm very proud of the job our senior team from our international business is doing as they manage and plan the business, and they've done a good job improving the business. Performance in the quarter was good with internal growth improving to 6% despite the lapping effect associated with a very large project. Continental Europe is experiencing strong volume gains from the investments we've made in real estate capacity and in building out our sales force. We landed two large seven figure DMS deals out of France and Germany in the quarter. Latin America and Asia Pacific both showed double digit internal growth rates and our JV's which is how we establish ourselves in the markets are also performing well. One to highlight is Russia where under Tom Keller's leadership, just since 2006, we've built up five facilities, have 500,000 cubic feet of records under management for 400 customers. So international continues to improve as well. Our playbook is to drive for higher productivity from those markets where we're most established, invest in selective geographic expansion and we expect to achieve North American returns over time.  So digital; we're more than holding our own at Iron Mountain digital. I've been in the technology business for a very long time, and this is as tough as I've seen it. Many of the best and biggest technology companies are going backwards in absolute performance. Sales cycles are longer; deal to firming is common place.  Internal growth for us in the quarter was 4%. Not bad on a relative basis, but it's not what we targeted. The reason that we are growing in absolute terms is because it is a trends favored business. For those of you that follow technology, you know that cloud if you will, is all the rage right now, and while it's an overused term, cloud computing essentially refers to, it's about only using the capacity you need and only paying for what you use.  And if you step back, that's been Iron Mountain's business model since inception. That's how we built the box business. That's how we built the tape business. And that's how we built our digital storage services business. And digital had some key, key wins during the quarter. One of the largest technology companies in the world standardized on our PC data protection solution for their entire company. AT&T continued the roll out of our data protection solutions across Europe throughout the quarter and our new products continue to launch well.  As a matter of fact, our core physical sales for is selling more digital products and is responsible for 40% of the pipeline for virtual file store, a solution that we've been introducing over the last couple of quarters that takes inactive data off of a customer's primary computer systems and storage systems and stores it in our vaults more securely and cost effectively than the customer could for themselves, cloud if you will. We continue to benefit from the explosive data growth and the brand permission that we have to protect other's information. There is both a curse and a benefit in IT budgets being constrained, but it does favor outsourcing which favors us of course. So it remains a trend favored business where we have a unique competitive advantage, although I will tell you I expect continued pressure in the short term as it relates to selling technology. As I said before, we're more than holding our own. So that should give you a good sense for how we're managing strong performance across North America, International and Digital. I'm going to turn it over to Brian now, but before I do, I want you to know that we remain very well positioned to advance our growth agenda while delivering great bottom line performance. I look forward to your questions in a few minutes after Brian McKeon; our Chief Financial Officer concludes his financial commentary.
Brian McKeon: Good morning everybody. Q2 was a solid quarter for Iron Mountain. Our results were highlighted by continued strong year on year OIBDA growth in the face of economic pressures that are moderating top line gains. Core revenues which comprised 87% of our total revenues in the quarter and are a key indicator of the health of our business, grew a solid 6% organically and offset expected weakness in our complimentary service revenues. As expected, the year on year strengthening of the U.S. dollar against our major foreign currencies lowered both reported revenue and OIBDA growth in the quarter by approximately 7%. The dollar did weaken materially within the quarter which resulted in gains in other income and our book tax provision. This resulted in an increased of our reported EPS of $0.18 per share.  Excluding currency impact, revenues grew 17%, reflecting benefits from our continued focus on disciplined execution across our business. Overall, our Q2 performance was in line with our expectations and builds on the solid start to the year. We're positive about our business performance and outlook and remain on track towards delivering solid full year results. Today we will review our quarterly results and provide an update on our cash flow performance, capital spending and our current debt position. We'll also provide additional perspective on our 2009 guidance and the refinements we've made to some of its components. Slide 4 highlights the key messages from today's review. As noted, Iron Mountain delivered solid financial results in Q2 with performance trends similar to those we saw in the first quarter. Internal growth was sustained at 4% with overall growth constrained by an expected decline in complimentary service revenues including impacts from lower recycle paper pricing. Core revenue internal growth, while solid at 6% in the quarter, is tracking below our target range as economic factors continue to limit core revenue gains. As Bob mentioned, service activity levels have not moderated. Core technology services are longer to complete than usual, and destruction activity has increased as some customers implement long term cost saving initiatives. Despite these impacts, we continue to deliver very strong OIBDA performance at the high end of our forecasted range, benefiting from record center and transportation productivity initiatives, improved storage margins and disciplined cost controls. For the quarter, we delivered solid OIBDA growth of 10% on a reported basis and 17% excluding the impacts of foreign currency rate changes. As a reminder, 3% of this growth is due to the initial re-characterization of vehicle leases as we previously discussed. We also continue to improve our cash flows and strengthen our balance sheet. We remain on track towards delivering record cash flows this year, supported by disciplined capital spending and have maintained strong liquidity and record low leverage ratios. The factors driving our profit and cash gains are sustainable and are keeping us on track for a strong full year performance. In terms of our outlook for 2009, we are adjusting our full year internal revenue growth guidance to reflect year to date trends while refining our OIBDA outlook positively to incorporate our strong first half performance and reflect current FX levels. I'll speak to this in more detail later in the presentation.  Let's move on now to looking at details of our revenue growth performance on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. As noted, our total internal growth for the quarter was 4% consistent Q1 trends. Internal growth in our core revenues was 6% for the quarter. As noted, these revenues represent 87% of total revenues in Q2 and provide a solid foundation for our overall revenue growth. While core revenues growth remains solid, economic factors are constraining gains below the 8% to 9% growth range we targeted earlier this year. Storage growth is being moderated by longer new sales cycles in our digital business. While physical storage rates have sustained, factors such as higher destruction rates have constrained gains below strong target growth levels. Core service revenues which were up 5% on an internal growth basis in the quarter, have also been trending below our goals as activity based revenues have been impacted by the ongoing economic slowdown. Complimentary revenues which are the most likely to be impacted by economic conditions, declined 6% organically in the quarter. As expected, we saw pressure in Q2 due to the completion of a major public service contract last year and from lower recycled paper revenues. These impacts were partially offset by a large license deal completed in the quarter and the continued solid performance by our stratify business. We're planning for economic impacts to continue in the near term and have adjusted our full year internal growth outlook to reflect year to date trends. Offsetting these impacts are more favorable trends on the FX front. For the quarter, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against all foreign currencies over the last year, led to a 7% decrease in reported year on year revenues. However, more recently we've seen a weakening in the U.S. dollar and based on current foreign currency rates, we expect the year over year impact of FX to be less than originally anticipated. We're now expecting a full year negative impact of 5% rather than 7%. As a result, we expect our full year reported revenue growth to remain in the minus 3% to 0% range.  Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our P&L performance. Slide 6 compares the results for this quarter to Q2 of 2008. Overall, productivity gains, favorable business mix and disciplined cost controls enabled us to deliver continued strong bottom line performance. Our overall revenue performance was in line with expectations. Our largest segment, North American physical posted 4% total internal growth. Continues solid core internal core revenue gains were offset by the decline in recycled paper prices and lower project revenues. The weakening of the Canadian dollar reduced reported revenue growth in this segment. Our international physical business achieved 6% total internal growth, supported by strong core revenue gains in Continental Europe, Latin America and Asia. As expected, the total internal growth rate was impacted by decreased complimentary service revenues, including impacts from the completion of a large European project in 2008. Reported growth was reduced by more that 20% due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the last year. As noted in previous calls, our international revenues and costs are aligned in local currencies and these changes don't impact the health of our business. Finally, our digital segment posted 4% internal growth. Stratify continues to perform well and our Q2 results benefited from a major license win. Overall digital revenue gains were constrained however, by pressure on new subscription sales. Sustainable productivity gains, particularly in our North American physical business helped drive strong year on year improvement of 320 basis points in our gross margin. Gains were also supported by a higher storage gross margin in North American and the sale of our low margin data products business. Our gross profit and gross margin also benefited from the $5 million reduction in rent expense due to the initial re-characterization of certain vehicle operating leases to capital leases. SG&A growth was 2% in the quarter compared to prior levels excluding the impact of FX changes. This modest growth rate reflects the benefit of overhead cost controls we've advanced.  OIBDA was $217 million for the quarter, up 10%. Included in our OIBDA for Q2 of 2009 is a $1 million asset loss compared to a gain of $1 million in Q2 of 2008. Excluding asset gains and losses, OIBDA increased 11% on a year on year basis, including 3% of growth from the initial re-characterization of certain vehicle leases. OIBDA growth was reduced by about 7% due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in Q2, 2009 compared to Q2 of last year. Depreciation was $70 million and amortization was $9 million, in line with expectations, reflecting continued capital spending controls. D&A grew $6 million versus prior year levels in Q2, primarily reflecting the additional depreciation associated with the re-characterization of the vehicle leases. Operating income was $138 million for Q2 of 2009, up 11% versus the prior year. Excluding asset gains and losses, operating income grew 13%. Moving on with our review of Q2 P&L performance, Slide 7 bridges our Q2 operating income to net income attributable to Iron Mountain, and EPS results. As discussed, operating income for the quarter was up a strong 11% to $138 million on a reported basis.  Our Q2 interest expense decreased compared to Q2 of 2008, driven primarily by lower debt levels and reduced interest rates. These gains were further enhanced by positive impacts to other income and our effective tax rate from changes in FX rates since the end of Q1 which would increase net income by $36 million or $0.18 per diluted share in Q2. As a result, we reported net income attributable to Iron Mountain for the quarter of $88 million or $0.43 per diluted share. As discussed on prior earnings calls, large fluctuations in foreign currencies during the quarter can result in meaningful accounting impacts as we mark our foreign contracts and debt to market and record the appropriate tax affects from these changes. In Q2, favorable FX changes drove $17 million of other income. We also recorded a $19 million tax benefit on these amounts, reflecting both foreign currency gains and losses incurred in different tax jurisdictions. These impacts are one time and primarily non cash in nature. In Q2, the impact of foreign currency rate changes reduced our effective tax rate by about 26 points. Other discrete items such as FIN48 interest, changes to tax reserves and other adjustments reduced our effective tax rate by an additional 1% in the quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate before the impact of foreign currency rate changes and other discrete items was 41%. This was slightly higher than forecast due to a shift in income between foreign jurisdictions and higher un-benefitted losses in some of our foreign subsidiaries. We're currently forecasting our tax rate before the impact of foreign currency rate changes and other discrete items for 2009 to be approximately 40%. Let's turn to Slide 8 to look at our year to date results. Turning to Slide 8, you can see that our Q2 results continue the trends we saw in Q1, resulting in a very solid start to the year. Overall, we continue to drive strong operating profit performance, despite economic factors constraining revenue growth. Internal revenue growth is consistent at 4% supported by solid core revenue internal growth of 7%, offsetting expected pressures on complimentary service revenues.  We're building on these gains through a disciplined approach to deliver strong, sustainable profit results. Productivity gains and improved pricing in North America are key factors supporting a 290 basis point improvement in gross profit. Combined with controlled overhead spending, this resulted in a 370 basis point improvement in our year to date OIBDA margin. Net income for the first half of 2009 was $116 million compared to $69 million for the same period in 2008. The key factors impacting the 2009 results are higher operating income, and the impact of foreign currency rate changes on other income and our effective tax rate. For the first six months of 2009, FX changes have resulted in $24 million of other income including the associated tax benefit. Combined, these factors have added $0.12 to our year to date EPS. Adjusting both years EPS results to exclude these factors, comparable EPS has increased 45% year to date. Let's shift now to reviewing drivers of our cash flow performance. Slide 9 summarizes our capital spending for the quarter. It highlights our year to date results compared to the full year 2008 amounts and our current 2009 outlook. Our year to date 2009 CapEx is $116 million, including $9 million for real estate. Traditionally, the first half of the year is lighter with respect to CapEx as many of our projects are scheduled for later in the year and many require time to plan and source before the significant expenditures are eventually made. We're currently spending to our plan and expect to finish the year on target. As a percent of revenue, this will sustain the record low performance levels achieved in 2008. We remain focused on aggressively drive efficiencies in our capital spending while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long term return improvement. Let's now move to Slide 10 and look a free cash flow for the quarter. Slide 10 highlights our year to date cash performance compared to the same period in 2008. For the first half of 2009, free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $121 million. The year on year increase in free cash flow is supported by higher OIBDA and disciplined control of capital expenditures. For 2009 we continue to expect free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investment in real estate to be approximately $210 million to $240 million. This will result in a strong improvement over record 2008 levels, reflecting continued benefits from our efforts to improve profitability and capital efficiency. Now let's turn to Slide 11 to review our debt statistics. Our focus on cash flow improvement is supporting continued strengthening of our balance sheet and liquidity. In terms of our debt portfolio, we ended the second quarter of 2009 in a very strong position. Our weighted average interest rate is down to 6.8% and we're 81% fixed. Maturity is now 6.7 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2012. Consolidated leverage at the end of Q2 remained at 3.6 times, below the low end of our target range of four to five times OIBDA and substantially below our 5.5 times covenant limit.  As we've discussed in the past, our business will naturally de-lever in the absence of meaningful acquisition spending. With limited acquisition activity over the last year, and benefits from our stronger operating cash flow, we've seen significant improvements in leverage ratios and liquidity. We currently have over $315 million in cash and $565 million in additional borrowing capacity. We have a very strong balance sheet and we're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. This concludes of our review of the Q2 2009 results. In summary, we're positive about the results both operationally and financially. Operationally, we continue to make progress in strengthening our core North American business which is the engine for our financial performance, while expanding our international and digital growth platforms. Financially, we delivered financial results at the high end of our target ranges in a tough environment while strengthening our balance sheet and cash flow performance.  Let's now turn to Slide 12 to review our updated financial guidance for Q3 and the full year 2009. Slide 12 summarizes our full year 2009 and Q3 outlook. We've refined our full year revenue range to $2.980 million to $3,040 million. As noted, we lowered our internal growth forecast to 3.25% with these impacts offset by an improved outlook for FX. Our reported revenue growth guidance is in a similar range. With respect to OIBDA, we're moving up the low end of our guidance range to $830 million reflecting our strong first half performance and recent FX exchanges. We're now targeting 10% to 14% constant currency OIBDA growth. As a reminder, included in OIBDA for 2009 is about $20 million of reduced rental expense related to the re-characterization of our vehicle operating leases to capital leases. This adds about 3% to our 2009 OIBDA growth rate. Offsetting the reduction of the rent expense are increases to our depreciation and interest expense and as such, there's limited impact from the exchanges to net income. As noted, we're maintaining our capital expenditure forecast at $380 million for the year including about $55 million for real estate. For the third quarter, we're projecting revenues of $760 million to $780 million and OIBDA of $215 million to $225 million.  A couple of factors to note in terms of our outlook for Q3, first our core service growth will face a tougher comparison given the peak levels of fuel surcharges we saw in Q3 of 2008. Our OIBDA outlook also incorporates the advancement of select project spending in areas such as global procurement to help build on our progress in driving productivity gains. Turning now to Slide 13, you can see our updated expectations for the P&L below the OIBDA line for the full year 2009. As we just discussed, our OIBDA outlook calls for performance in the $830 million to $860 million range. Our outlook for D&A is slightly higher at $320 million reflecting FX impacts and interest expense remains unchanged from our outlook shared last quarter. As a reminder, we don't forecast other income and expense or non controlling interests, so the amounts you see are the year to date actual results. Likewise, with respect to our tax provision, we've assumed a 40% structural rate plus the actual impact of discrete items recorded in the first half of 2009. These expectations summed together yield EPS in the range of $0.99 to $1.06 per diluted share, assuming 204 million shares outstanding.  As a reminder, our first half results included impacts to other income and expense and our effective tax rate from changes in FX rates since the end of 2008 which increased net income attributable to Iron Mountain by $24 million or about $0.12 per diluted share. Adjusting EPS for 2009 and 2008 to exclude these factors, this outlook implies comparable EPS growth of 12% to 25%. That concludes my opening remarks. We'll now open the lines for Q&A.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Andrew Steinerman – J.P. Morgan.
Andrew Steinerman – J.P. Morgan: Obviously a very fine job on productivity gains. I want to focus in on Bob's comments that you're optimizing the core while still investing in growth in strategy is in full gear now. Are we investing for growth right now or are we holding back on some of those investments this year which will shift investment spending into next year, or do you feel like we're doing the investments we want, we're not holding back and there's not any kind of delayed on investment intentions?
Robert Brennan: We're not bridling the investment profile for long term growth. That would be stupid. I wouldn't do that.
Brian McKeon: We're absolutely advancing investments and I think Bob was hitting on the key themes around penetrating vertical segments, new product emphasis and we were able to at the same time drove productivity improvements so that we can manage that balance and deliver solid bottom line gains.
Robert Brennan: We are careful about prioritization. We're focused on the biggest opportunities and very small opportunities don't get as much attention, but we are very much focused on long term growth and we're not in any way bridling investment on the potential of our business.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Gold – Sidoti & Company.
David Gold – Sidoti & Company: Just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the changes in storage growth both as the years progressed and on the forecast. I think as we look at it over the last couple of quarters, we've gone from 8% to 7% to 6%, a fairly good showing in our view given what's happening over there economically speaking. But a couple of things; one, I guess just your confidence from here that it truly hold which is what the guidance seems to imply, maybe modestly down, and then two, curious and this may be a tougher one to answer, but in our view being the first quarter was terrible economically speaking and the second quarter was a little bit better, are we seeing now a little bit of a lag or has it truly slowed a little bit in the second quarter?
Brian McKeon: In terms of our outlook, our outlook is very consistent with our current trends, so I think that in terms of your question, and obviously that's a bit below the strong growth rates that we were posting coming out of last year and that impacted how we thought about our targets for this year. But I think our outlook is very consistent with the trends that we're seeing and they're consistent with the trends we're seeing year to date. So the pressure on productivity is level. It is something that we highlighted in our last call.
Robert Brennan: It's a tough environment for selling. It is driven by the economy. We do see it settling down, but I don't see a lot of catalysts like a sudden resurgence either
Brian McKeon: You should know that our outlook assumes that current conditions continue. We're not projecting an improvement so we think we've got the growth rate appropriately calibrated. We had some aggressive targets heading into this year. As you noted, we're still posting good growth but I think we felt it appropriate to calibrate to reflect current trends.
Robert Brennan: And just to give you some color on how we think about it internally, we think we're doing a really good job.
David Gold – Sidoti & Company: The improvement in margin, essentially could you give a sense of sustainability there? In other words, have we made any changes that are maybe shorter terms as things revert to growth that we might not be able to hold?
Robert Brennan: I want to bridge that back to Andrew's question. We think about this business as a team for the very long term. We have the benefit of a resilient business and we have the benefit of a market that is expanding rapidly as a result of information growth and constrained IT budgets, and we think about the business for the very long term. So we're not doing anything to as I said before, bridle the business for short term results. It's just not how we operate. And that's been the philosophy since we've been a public company and prior to that when Alisa and Richard talk about days gone by.
Brian McKeon: I would highlight one thing too, which is we've obviously very pleased with the results that we're seeing in areas like productivity gains and things that are supporting our performance. Those are results that followed investment. So the programs that we talk about, transportation improvement, pricing excellence, record center optimization, CFR, those are proactive investments that we feel very good about. I did try to highlight that we're going to continue advancing investments on that front. We're not launching a big initiative around global procurement as a company that involve some upfront investment that we think has great yield and payback over time.  My sense is that the core of the question is around the things that we're doing short term in nature and not sustainable or we're managing the results, and I'd say that this is consistent with the approach we've been pursuing and highlighting. We are going to continue to invest, be focused and prioritize. We drive benefit that enables us to keep up. A lot of folks inside would say we scrutinize the investments very closely.
David Gold – Sidoti & Company: So the questions mostly are more about thinking about the future. For instance, presumably even if you didn't bridle back on spend; there are factors in there like let's say salary freezes that when things come back, presumably you can't hold that. So just more trying to get a sense of how much of it is a function of the environment. Folks obviously understand salary freezes in this type of environment versus things revert to growth holding margins here.
Robert Brennan: We are very disciplined in how we manage the business. We have not frozen anybody's salary and we're being very careful about where we invest. We're being very careful about what head count we bring on. We're being very careful about what projects get put in play. But there's no arbitrary like everybody gets a salary cut. We're not behaving that way.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird.
Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird: I want to go back to the guidance and make sure I understand it clearly. When you think about what you have been looking at for the year, essentially your first half revenue guidance did really come in line with expectations, so is it fair to say now we're assuming revenue growth stays essentially in line with where we're at right now for the rest of the year, but what you had been assuming is that that growth would actually get a little bit better throughout the year? That's the difference?
Brian McKeon: Our current expectation is that our full year growth, our balance sheet growth is in line with current trends. I did highlight one factor which is in the third quarter; we're going to be up against our toughest compare on core service. Some of the dialogue that we have, in that we had fuel surcharges that were basically our position to offset fuel costs so we get a benefit in revenue and when we have an increase in costs and when the costs come down, our revenue comes down. We'll have a tougher compare on that in Q3 in the core service line, but effectively our outlook for the balance of the year is consistent with our recent trends. That is below where we were and that was the key news item, but we think we've got six months of experience in the current climate and we think that's appropriate given the trends that we're seeing.
Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird: I wonder if you could give us an update on scrap paper prices. It looks like they actually did improve sequentially from last quarter. Just wondering how that's playing at all. Is it really enough to move the OIBDA line at all and is that playing any impact on that number being a little bit higher as well?
Brian McKeon: We factored in some recent improvement. It's obviously still well below where it was last year. We were north of $200 a ton in the market and we had been trending in the $90 per ton to $100 per ton range. That's improved to about $110 very recently. It looks like a kind of calibration of supply and demand is coming through a bit favorably. Certainly supply has come down a lot and some of the Asian demand seems to be holding up okay, so we don't anticipate, we factored in those kind of levels for the balance of the year. We're not projecting continued improvement, so if we continue to see improvement on the at front, that could yield some benefit. But it looks a little bit better, but still well down year on year, so you'll still see those pressures in Q3.
Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird: When you look at your CapEx expectations going forward in terms of the level of spend, should we still assume that this 10.8% level when you look, you said 2010 initially, do we go below that level for 2010 or do we actually go up from there?
Brian McKeon: We'll give you an update on that, our preliminary view at I-day. Strategically we're absolutely trying to get that number down over time. Any given year you can have some movement and we're not prepared to go into the details on that yet, but we're absolutely trying to bring that number down over time and obviously we've made a lot of progress on that the last couple of years.
Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird: I was wondering if you could give us an update on pricing, particularly North America.
Brian McKeon: We continue to sustain the solid improvements we've seen in the North American records management business and we talk about moving that up into the 3% type range and we're as Bob mentioned, we feel very good about the progress we made putting sustainable processes to achieve that improvement and build on that over time. So that is a factor that helped our storage gross margins. It's obviously only one part of our business. When you look at other parts of our business, internationally, in digital, those are principally volume driven businesses. We're not doing the same of pricing strategies in every part of our business, but in the North American records management business, we've sustained that good progress.
Andrea Wirth – Robert Baird: So you actually were at 3% North America records or you're still working towards that?
Brian McKeon: In the year to date range we were in the 3% range for that business. I'm a little concerned just to be open about it that we confuse people with this. It's obviously, that's a number that incorporates price and mix. It's only one part of our business, but we've obviously highlighted that as an area of progress and we're in that same type of a range that we had talked about in our last call.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Within the health care vertical, how would you characterize the customers' ability to pay for services right now when hospital administrators are facing tight financials from fewer elective procedures, higher bad debts and so forth? How is that working out?
Brian McKeon: We don't see any material change in their ability to pay us, but we can help them because they're not having to outlay capital. That's where the big trend shifts to us, is that normally, if you're a mid market hospital, you have a choice to either send your patient to another hospital so you can have imaging services done because you can't afford to buy the storage, or you can turn to us and pay as you go. So it's actually, we feel that is a very strong market for us going forward and we have a lot of untapped potential. It's a business that builds over time like all of our businesses. It's a recurring business. But we'll continue to chip away at it, and we don't see any degradation from the receivables perspective in that segment.
Robert Brennan: It's an area of focus, not an area of concern. We're managing that well across the business.
Brian McKeon: I think Bob highlighted that. Across all customer segments the sales cycles are longer. It's a tougher environment to try to get new business, but we're certainly seeing a lot of interest in the services we offer.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: How does the joint venture nature of the international expansion when it is a JV, how does that impact the ultimate returns that you hope to see, because you mentioned that hopefully those returns will hit the North America levels over time. Could you give us a feel for that?
Brian McKeon: I think the right way to think about it is that we have a portfolio of businesses in our international markets, and so the joint ventures are, they're in the early stages of development. This is where we're working with partners to build the flywheel for the future. They are businesses that we anticipate investing and losing money in the early years and as those businesses mature and we buy them in over time, I know that's our strategic intent, they get on a track towards higher returns and our goals to get them to North American like levels.
Robert Brennan: I mentioned Russia. We've been pouring a lot of money into that business with our joint venture partner. We're not making money on that, but they're doing a great job building out our footprint.
Brian McKeon: I think it is an important point. We will always have a degree of a lag in our international returns versus our North American returns because we're explicitly investing in part of that portfolio to build for the future. But our strategy across the board is that we can build these businesses over time to North American like levels.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh – Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh – Credit Suisse: I wonder if you can give us an update on the government vertical and how that's been trending. I know we've been investing a fair amount there. I wanted to get your sense about how trends are there?
Robert Brennan: Not unlike other companies, it's slow. It's steady. There's a lot of spending going on there. We think the investments that we've made in these facilities that will allow us to offer compliant records management to anybody that does business with the government. That market will come to us. It's hard for some of our competitors to make those same investments. It's a lot of money in anticipation of revenue as opposed to reaction to revenue. But as people become more compliant and as the government insists on that compliance, we think the market will come to us. But like with all of our businesses, it's a flywheel. It builds slowly, but once it has momentum, we feel very good about it. We have a dedicated team down in D.C. that focuses on the market in co-ordination with our local teams, to focus on State and local governments. When we think about government that we're really focused on, the United States Government for the purpose of compliant Federal record keeping and we believe we have unique competitive advantage, and they're going to see their information grow, and they're going to see the requirements associated with protecting that growth.
Kevin McVeigh – Credit Suisse: I wonder if you could spend a minute on the competitive environment. Obviously as we get deeper into this, on the storage business versus the destruction business, how competitors have been behaving.
Robert Brennan: It's very mixed and can be erratic. From a storage perspective, I think that the industry understands the way we're managing the business and is following our lead. From a shredding perspective, that's a much or erratic business where we have to choose to decline business against certain competitors just taking the price perspective and we passed on that business. So it's really, I mentioned the large retailer where we got 2,100 locations and the two financial services firms that we won. So we're winning very large deals. That's meant to imply that there's a bunch of little ones that people are pricing aggressively because they're faced with economic scarcity, and we're passing on that business, and focusing where we have competitive advantage relative to chain of custody, relative to our footprint and our ability to handle very large projects with customers that don't focus on the overall cost of the program and it's hard to beat us across 2,100 locations.
Operator: Your next question comes from Franco Turrinelli – William Blair.
Franco Turrinelli – William Blair: Maybe it doesn't even make sense to think about this way anymore, but when we were primarily talking about a physical business, we talk about new documents coming in from existing customers, new sales to new customers and then obviously the destruction at the back end. Maybe it doesn't make sense to think about it this way, but I was really trying to get a sense of which pieces of that equation have really changed relative to your expectations at the beginning of the year?
Brian McKeon: I think it's right to raise the question. Our business is certainly a lot more complicated in terms of the different product lines we're in, geographies, etc. We did try to highlight within the physical business that we've sustained solid growth rates, that where we have seen a change relative to our expectations certainly in areas like destructions, as Bob mentioned, that's an area we have seen increases really much tied to the economic trends. It really was something that we saw start to increase in the fourth quarter and pick up more early this year and that's directly related to customers looking at cost controls.
Robert Brennan: And us helping them with it quite frankly.
Brian McKeon: I would say that the sales processes are not dissimilar to across the business that new sales are taking longer, and that's an additional factor with the margin. But fundamentally the business is growing and solid and it's just I think some of these factors are playing in and that's why we're updating you.
Franco Turrinelli – William Blair: Is there a meaningful change in, I think you sort of alluded to this a little bit, but maybe I can drill down a little bit. Has there been a meaningful change in the rate of document production that you've seen, really just from employment levels and overall macro activity. You talked about it a little bit. I'm just trying to get a sense of how meaningful that is.
Brian McKeon: Just to go back, we continue to see solid growth in our business and that reflects our business base, producing more records, and the factors that are changing are more related to some of these economic impacts, principally things like disruptions and to a lesser degree new sales.
Franco Turrinelli – William Blair: Destructions, I thought destructions actually started to push up near term revenue but take away from future revenue. Am I still thinking about it the right way?
Robert Brennan: They do have some benefit in the near term. That's right. It's something that's been building for a little bit and we're seeing some of those impacts here today.
Franco Turrinelli – William Blair: Does destruction fall in core services? Yes, right?
Robert Brennan: Yes. You see you have a lot of dynamics here. The earlier point about the complexity of our business, there's lots of dynamics in core services. We lost two points of growth from fuel surcharges, activity levels have moderated, so it gets a little complication, the dynamic. We're really trying to highlight as we're looking at our outlook, why our growth rates are a bit lower than we had targeted.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Could you speak a little bit to what the largest verticals are, perhaps percent of total revenue and how that's different from going back three or fourth quarters?
Robert Brennan: We don't break out the percentages but it hasn't changed materially over the last year. Financial services, health care, legal are our biggest segments.
Brian McKeon: As a group financial services is the biggest. If you put together professional services, legal, accounting, that would be in a similar range to financial services and then obviously you've got health care as kind of next on the list in terms of just size. But they're all meaningful large verticals. We basically do records management across everything.
Robert Brennan: When I called out the segments, government is still small for us and we see a lot of opportunity going forward. It's going to take time to build that business, but the others are very meaningful businesses for us. And we haven't seen a lot of movement in the percentage over the last four quarters.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: You mentioned when you're speaking on financial services, about litigation activity, regulation activity. Is that something that you're seeing here and now or is that something you're seeing building and think is an opportunity
Robert Brennan: Both. We're benefiting from the litigation that's occurring between counter-parties on sub-prime, the consolidation with companies acquiring one another within the sector and how we can help them through that and we see more of that going forward.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: In digital, how is the competitive landscape. You mentioned sales cycles extending. What are you seeing more specifically there?
Robert Brennan: Just look at the public comps, right. They're going backwards. So it's a very brutal environment for selling technology. I'm pleased actually with the growth. It wasn't what we expected, but the fact that our business expanded and it's because, again it goes back to the overall Iron Mountain Value proposition.  Everything that we offer as a service is meant to reduce cost. So it allows us to keep people at the table. But if you're selling technology that's in any way nice to have, it's very tough out there. When I talk about companies that are going backwards, we're talking about some of the best companies in the technology industry that have sterling reputations. So we feel we're very much holding our own, but it's a tough, tough environment.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: So pricing is tough as well I would assume.
Robert Brennan: It's very difficult to get people to pull the trigger on purchasing. Price negotiations are tough, but it's more getting them to move on buying, and so the sales cycles are taking longer. The pipelines are doing great. The top of the funnel is doing great. It's getting people through the funnel. I think if you listen to the commentary from some of the biggest names in the business they can offer very granular detail on that. We have the benefit of being a recurring business so we don't have to push the rock up the hill to the same extent.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: On your cost management and productivity initiatives, I now it's ongoing and persistent, would you say that the low hanging fruit is captured? What inning are we in of those initiatives and if you could take us a level deeper there.
Brian McKeon:  I would say we're, the inning reference is always a great one. We still see a lot of room here. I think a good way to think about it is, we're moving to different phases of opportunity so I know that procurement as kind of a next phase. It's an area we have a level of co-ordination but I think we can do a lot better. So we think there's a lot of fruit left to pick.
Robert Brennan: We try to hold to our one hour limit so we're going to wrap up the Q&A now. Thank you all for your time and attention this morning. We very much appreciate you listening to us and your support.

===== 2009 Q1  (2009-04-30 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Stephen Golden – Vice President, Investor Relations Robert Brennan – President, Chief Executive Officer Brian McKeon – Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Andrew Steinerman – J. P. Morgan Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi David Gold – Sidoti & Co. Kevin McVeigh – Credit Suisse Edward Atorino – Benchmark Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer Franco Turinelli – William Blair & Co.
Operator: I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Golden, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Stephen Golden: Welcome everyone to our 2009 first quarter earnings conference call. After my announcements this morning, Bob Brennan will give his state of the company remarks followed by Brian McKeon who will deliver the financial review. When Brian is finished, we'll open up the phones for Q&A. Now that spring has officially sprung, we'll be getting out just a bit. We'll be appearing at the Bank of America One on One Conference in New York in about two weeks followed by the Citigroup Conference One on One in Boston at the end of the month. In June, we are presenting at the William Blair Conference in Chicago. On the credit side, we'll be presenting at the Deutsche Bank European Leverage Finance Conference in London in mid-June. We're looking forward to seeing many of you at these events. Per our custom, we have a user controlled slide presentation on the investor relations page of our website at www. ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2009 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our most recently filed 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, operating income before G&A or OIBDA and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments are metrics we speak of frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures as required by Rate G at the investor relations page of our website as well as in today's press release. With that, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bob Brennan.
Robert Brennan: Good morning everyone. I hope you're doing well. Since we just recently had our year end call, this call will be more of an update on our performance than it is a revisit of our long standing strategy. I'm going to highlight our business performance in Q1 and touch on our segments. Brian's going to cover our financial performance in detail, review our full year guidance and then afterwards we'll both take your questions. A couple of key things I want to get across to you this morning. The first is, we're off to a very good start and our business is performing as expected. While reported revenues were down 3% including FX impact, on a constant currency basis, we're up a solid 4%.  Our core internal revenues were up a strong 7% and as a reminder; these are largely recurring revenues in our business that represent 88% of our sales. They are a key indicator of our business health and they're tracking well. These gains offset pressures that we expected on complimentary revenues which remain impacted by economic conditions. The second key message I want you to hear is that the environment is tough. We are facing some unfavorable macro factors but we're managing well. We're delivering strong financial results benefiting from disciplined management and focused prioritization. OIBDA grew 12% and we exceeded our Q1 expectations while strengthening our cash flow and balance sheet so we believe we're on tract to deliver against our full year financial objectives and we're raising our OIBDA guidance to reflect our strong Q1 performance. I do want to pause though and reinforce that we manage to the full year, not quarterly results. While we're pleased with our strong profit performance in Q1, we intend to continue investing against our growth potential and believe our updated OIBDA outlook for the full year reflects an appropriate target range for Iron Mountain. Before I review some key areas in our business, let me comment briefly on market conditions. It remains tough out there, but consistent with the expectations that we set for ourselves and that we've set with you, we're seeing pressures in the areas that we expected to see pressure. Special projects are pressured. Software license sales are pressured. Fulfillment services are pressured. We're also seeing pressures from factors such as foreign exchange and low paper pricing.  We expect these impacts to continue and will continue to manage them in a disciplined way, prioritizing our focus, prioritizing our investments, but we're managing them well. And despite these pressures, I just want to reinforce that we have a highly resilient business. We're performing well and we're very focused on the right investments. Our customers, it's also worth noting, need us whether times are good or bad. We're in the business of providing information management services, and the mega trend that we follow is one of information growth. Information growth doesn't go on recession and all of our solutions, every one of our solutions across all of our businesses focus on lowering costs. So our business remains strong. Let me just review our progress across the business segments starting with our biggest and best business, North America. North America as you know is strategically driven by both growth and returns. The team continues to improve their execution. They had solid core growth in the quarter and exceeded their bottom line targets. We also had some key wins that are worth noting. One was one of the largest transportation companies in the world that wanted to really look at their rich heritage and all of their files that went back to 180 year history and how we could help them convert those back files and also manage their records on a go forward basis so that we could capture them, convert them and store them appropriately for their most vital records. And the decision to work with us on this massive project really came down to the chain of custody in the investments we've made in security over the years, that you can see us getting value for throughout the business today. Another key win for us was the Principal Financial Group. Like many customers, Principal is an existing customer, but they chose to in source some of their records management. Having worked with us over the years, and spending a lot of time with us in Q1, we were able to convince them that what they were doing in house, we could do for them less expensively and more securely, resulting in an awful lot of business coming from them both in terms of recurring revenue and special projects. We also made progress in the government sector during the quarter. This is something that we've been signaling for a few quarters now, because we anticipated changes in regulations as to how you store federal records whether you're a government agency yourself, or you do business with the government, there are deadlines that are approaching around you have to store that. We anticipated that and have built nearly two million cubic feet of space that is under development. We've got over a third of that space already booked and we expect to add more facilities as that market demand reveals itself. So a lot of good wins during the quarter from a growth perspective. As you know this is a balanced agenda that we have with North America so we remain focused on productivity, the same productivity initiatives that we've been talking about for years.  So when we talk about work flow optimization internally, we refer to it as record center optimization. Think of that as to what we do inside the building to be more productive. Transportation optimization, think about that as what we do outside the building. We do a lot of management training, but it's all focused on moving from market to market and we're realizing big savings as we move from market to market. We also chose to work with some best in class partners from an infrastructure perspective during the quarter, having reached an agreement with Jones, Lange, and LaSalle to help us with real estate administration and salesforce.com to help us with our sales force automation. The most important thing I want to get across to you is that we continue to improve in how we invest capital and it's showing in our results, but we're being very sharply focused, a little more centralized than we have been in the past, and again, it's showing in our results. Bottom line though is North America is doing a great job. So let me move to International. Brian and I actually just came back from a review of our international businesses and the team is executing well on the strategy of driving a North American like return in established markets like the U.K., investing in sales and facility capacity in expanding markets like Latin America and continental Europe, and co-investing with JV partners in emerging or nation markets like Russia and Turkey. During the quarter core revenue grew 6%, supported by solid storage growth in Europe and continued gains throughout Latin America. International leads our DMS innovation and has moved further up the value chain with our customers taking over processes that range from credit card applications, to cell phone activation, to invoice tracking systems. Overall during the quarter, international progress was constrained by the expected end of a big project and the foreign exchange pressures you're aware of. I am pleased however with the momentum that's building between and amongst the leaders and their businesses in the international segment and I expect that our investments in selling resources and management capability will result in continually improving performance with returns that approach those of North America. Let's move to digital. This is a business where we're focused on growing the business and building out a platform as a long term driver of growth. Our digital business made a lot of progress in Q1 mainly through new product releases, new partnerships and the continued strong performance of Stratify. New bookings are down and big license deals are off as we had expected them to be. It's harder to sell technology and it takes longer in this time. Having said that, new product releases, we did release a product that we first signaled to you on investor day last year, Virtual File Store which essentially stores inactive digital data in our digital vaults.  Think of it like it's really the box business for digital data. We announced a partnership with Micro Soft around cloud recovery. When you're using Micro Soft's data protection manager, and you want that information protected off site, it comes to Iron Mountain's digital vaults. A key win during the quarter was with one of the top financial institutions in the world, and this was really a function of our stratify solution where they were faced with a tremendous amount of litigation around their stock cropping, around sub prime litigation, disputes with counter parties and we were able to provide them a solution that gave them a single master repository with attorney/client privilege maintained across all these matters, applying a combination of people, technology and process like no competitor can, across nearly 20 million documents on multiple concurrent matters, saving our customer a lot of time, a lot of money and dramatically improving the likelihood of their success in litigation. So that's a review of our segments and our business. Before I turn it over to Brian, a couple of key points I want to reinforce, really where I started out. We are performing as expected. We've had a good start and I'm confident that we'll achieve our targets.  Most importantly, I want you to know that we are determined to extend our leadership for providing information management services and are of course committed to extending that leadership within the context of delivering our financial objectives. We appreciate the support of our customers, our employees, and of course you, our investors. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Brian McKeon.
Brian McKeon: Good morning everyone. Q1 was a solid quarter for Iron Mountain. Our results were highlighted by sustained core revenue, internal growth and strong year on year OIBDA margin gains which reflected favorable business mix shifts and benefits from our enhanced focused on disciplined execution across our business. Core revenues which represent 88% of total revenues in the quarter and are a key indicator of the health of our business, grew 7% organically. These gains offset expected weakness in our complimentary service revenues. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against our major foreign currencies lowered reported revenue and OIBDA growth in the quarter by 7% and 9% respectively. Similar to Q3 and Q4, 2008, exchange rate changes during the quarter required us to recognize charges in other expense and our book tax provision which lowered our reported EPS by about $0.06 per share. These factors however don't alter the fundamental of our business. Our Q1 performance provides a solid start to the year and based on these results, we're raising our OIBDA outlook for the full year. We're also making favorable revisions to our CapEx forecast. Today we'll review our quarterly results and provide an update on our cash flow performance, capital spending and our current debt position. We'll also provide an update on our perspective on our 2009 guidance. Slide 4 highlights the key messages from today's review. As noted, Iron Mountain delivered strong financial results in Q1, supported by healthy core revenue performance. Core internal revenue growth was 7% with solid gains across our major business units.  As expected, pressure on complimentary service revenues and impacts from the substantial strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the last year, constrained reported revenues. Despite these impacts, we drove strong OIBDA performance ahead of our expectations benefiting from year on year gross margin gains and overhead costs leverage in Q1. We delivered solid OIBDA growth despite negative impacts from FX which reduced reported results by 9%. We also continued to improve our cash flows and strengthen our balance sheet. We're on tract towards delivering record cash flows this year which is supporting continued improvement in our liquidity and leverage ratios.  In terms of our outlook for 2009, we're reinforcing our full year revenue guidance. As a result of our strong Q1 performance, we're raising our full year guidance for operating income and OIBDA. In addition, we've refined our capital spending plans for the year and now expect CapEx to be about $380 million for 2009 in line with controlled 2008 spending levels. Let's move on to looking at the details of our revenue performance on Slide 5. Slide breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. Form an internal growth perspective, our first quarter performance was as expected with results reflecting some of the toughest comparisons this year. Based on our current forecasts, we continue to expect full year internal growth of between 8% to 9% for core revenues and between 5% to 7% for total revenues. As noted, we drove solid internal growth of 7% in our core revenues for the quarter.  Core revenues which are comprised on storage revenues and core service revenues are key indicators of the health of our business. These revenues are recurring and predictable and represented 88% of total revenues in Q1. Overall, internal revenue growth was impacted by a 15% decline in complimentary revenues. As expected we saw pressure in Q1 due to the completion of a major European public service contract last year that resulted in a $5 million reduction in quarterly revenues. Lower recycle paper prices also impacted complimentary service revenue in the quarter by approximately $13 million. Together, these factors caused a 16% negative impact to Q1 complimentary service revenue growth. We've also seen lower growth in areas such as special projects, fulfillment services and software license sales, which are the areas most likely to be impacted by economic conditions.  As we've noted in the past, complimentary service revenue which represented about 12% of total revenues in the quarter can vary over time given fluctuations in demand and timing for special project activity as well as variation of factors such as recycle paper pricing. Based on these factors, our total revenue internal revenue growth rate was 4% for the quarter. As previously discussed, reported revenue growth was impacted by the year over year strengthening of the U.S. dollar against all foreign currencies. Our three largest currencies, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Euro weakened by 26%, 19% and 10% respectively over the last year leading to a 7% negative impact on reported revenues for the quarter. Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our P&L performance. Slide 6 compares the results for this quarter to Q1 of 2008. Overall, our revenue performance was as expected with solid core revenue internal growth offset by a decrease in complimentary service revenues and further reduced on a reported basis by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our largest segment, North American physical, posted 4% total internal growth supported by 7% core revenue internal growth. Core revenue gains were offset by a decline in recycle paper prices which along with lower project revenues contributed to a 17% decline in complimentary service revenues. The weakening of the Canadian dollar further reduced reported revenue in the North American segment. Our international physical business obviously felt the largest impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar as the segment's internal growth rate of 3% was reduced by more than 20% points due to FX changes. That being said, we did see solid core revenue performance supported by strong performance in Latin America, and consistent growth in Europe. As expected, the total internal growth rate was impacted by decreased by complimentary service revenues including meaningful impacts from the completion of a large European project in 2008. Finally, our digital segment posted 6% internal growth supported by double digit growth in core revenues and continued solid performance from our Stratify acquisition. As discussed on our last earnings call, this is a difficult environment for selling technology and we're seeing the expected pressure on our complimentary revenues particularly with respect to software license sales. Productivity gains, particularly in our North American physical business helped drive strong year on year improvement of 260 basis points in our gross margin. The higher storage gross margin and the sale of our low margin data products business were also key factors supporting gross margin gains. Our gross profit and gross margin also benefited from the $5 million reduction of rent expense due to the re-characterization of certain vehicle leases from operating leases to capital leases. SG&A growth was 1% in the quarter compared to prior levels excluding the impacts of FX changes. This modest growth rate reflects the benefits of overhead cost controls we've advanced as well as some shifts in the timing of planned initiative investments. OIBDA was $197 million for the quarter, up12%. Included in OIBDA for Q1 2009 is $2 million of asset gains compared to losses of $4 million in Q1 of 2008. Excluding asset gains and losses, OIBDA increased 9% on a year over year basis including 3% of growth benefit from the re-characterization of certain vehicle leases. OIBDA growth was reduced by 9% due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in Q1 2009 compared to Q1 of 2008. Depreciation was $68 million and amortization was $9 million, slightly below expectations, reflecting continued capital spending controls. G&A grew $6 million versus prior year levels in Q1, reflecting the additional depreciation associated with the re-characterization of the vehicle leases.  Operating income was $121 million for Q1 2009, up 14% versus the prior year. Excluding asset gains and losses, operating income grew 9%. Moving on with a review of our Q1 P&L performance, Slide 7 bridges our Q1 operating income to net income attributable to Iron Mountain and EPS results. Included in today's press release is a brief note on our adoption of SFAS-160 regarding among other things the presentation of non controlling interests and our consolidated financial statements? Going forward we'll be using the new term net income attributable to Iron Mountain, formerly net income as required by the new announcement. We'll include a more detailed discussion of this change in our first quarter 10-Q. As discussed, operating income for the quarter was up a strong 14% to #121 million on a reported basis. Our Q1 interest expense decreased compared to Q1 of 2007 driven primarily by lower debt levels and reduced interest rates. These gains were offset by impacts to other expense and our effective tax rate from changes in FX rates since the end of 2008 which reduced net income by $12 million or $0.06 per diluted share in Q1. As a result, we reported net income attributable to Iron Mountain for the quarter of $29 million or $0.14 per diluted share.  As we've discussed in our last two earnings calls, large fluctuations in foreign currencies during a quarter can result in meaningful accounting impacts as we mark our forward contracts and debt to market and record the appropriate tax effects from these changes. In Q1 FX drove a net $7 million charge in other expense. We also recorded a $5 million tax provision on these amounts reflecting both foreign currency gains and losses incurred in different tax jurisdictions. Note that these changes are one time and primarily non cash in nature. In Q1 the impact of foreign currency rate changes increased our effective tax rate by about 13 points. Other discrete items such as spin 48 interest, additional tax reserves and other adjustments also added a net 2% to our effective tax rate in the quarter. For the quarter, our tax rate before the impact of foreign exchange rate changes and other discrete items was 39% as expected. We're currently forecasting our tax rate before the impacts of foreign currency rate changes and other discrete items for 2009 to be approximately 39%. Let's turn to Slide 8 to look at our capital expenditures. Slide 8 summarizes our capital spending for the quarter. It highlights our year to date results compared to the full year 2008 amounts and our current 2009 outlook which we're lowering today. Our Q1 2009 CapEx was $51 million including $2 million for real estate. Traditionally the first quarter is a light CapEx quarter as some projects are scheduled later in the year and many require time to plan and source before the significant expenditures are eventually made. We scrutinize our capital spending on an ongoing basis and since our last earnings call, we've refined our full year CapEx estimates and now expect to spend approximately $380 million in 2009. This amount is consistent with 2008 levels in both dollar terms and as a percent of revenues. We're currently spending to our revised plan and expect to finish the year on target. We remain focused on aggressively driving efficiencies in our capital spending while also supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long term return improvement.  Let's now move on to Slide 9 and look at free cash flow for the quarter. Slide 9 highlights our year to date cash flow performance compared to the same period in 2008. For Q1 2009, free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $57 million. The year on year increase in free cash flow is supported by higher OIBDA and disciplined control of capital expenditures. Also included in the cash flows from operating activities is a $15 million realized cash gain on a British pound hedging contract that rolled over in the first quarter of 2009. For the full year 2009 we now expect free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to be approximately $210 million to $240 million. This will result in a strong improvement over record 2008 levels, reflecting continued benefits from our efforts to improve profitability and capital efficiency. Now let's turn to Slide 10 to review our debt statistics. Our focus on cash flow improvement is supporting continued strengthening of our balance sheet and liquidity. In terms of our debt portfolio, we ended the first quarter of 2009 in a very strong position. Our weighted average interest rate is down to 6.9% and we're 81% fixed. Maturities now at 6.9 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2012. Consolidated leverage at the end of Q1 was 3.6 times, below the low end of our target range of four to five times OIBDA and well within our 5.5 times covenant limit. As we've discussed in the past, our business will naturally de-lever in the absence of meaningful acquisitions pending. With limited acquisition activity over the last year, and benefits from our stronger operating cash flow, we've seen significant improvements in leverage ratios and liquidity. We currently have over $270 million and $560 million in additional bond capacity. We have a very strong balance sheet and we're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. While we maintain a solid operating outlook, we anticipate maintaining a more conservative approach to cash management in the current environment. This concludes our review of the4 Q1 2009 results. In summary, we're pleased with our results this quarter both operationally and financially. Operationally, we continue to make progress in strengthening our core North American business which is the engine for our financial performance while expanding our international and digital growth platforms. Financially, we delivered financial results that met or exceeded our targets in a tough environment while strengthening our balance sheet and cash flow performance. Let's now turn to Page 11 to review our updated financial guidance for Q2 and the full year 2009. Slide 11 summarizes our full year 2009 and Q2 outlook. We continue to target 5% to 7% internal revenue growth overall for the year with flat to moderate declines in reported revenues reflecting an estimated negative 7% impact from FX changes. With respect to OIBDA based on our Q1 performance, we're now targeting 11% to 16% constant currency growth. As a reminder, included in OIBDA for 2009 is $21 million of reduced rental expense related to our re-characterization of our vehicle leases from operating leases to capital leases. This change adds about 3% to our 2009 OIBDA growth rate. Offsetting the reduction in rent expense are increases in depreciation and interest expense and as such, there will be limited impact on this change to net income. As we noted, we're reducing our capital expenditure forecast by $40 million to approximately $380 million for the year.  For the second quarter, we're projecting revenues of $730 million to $750 million and OIBDA of $210 million to $220 million. We expect continued pressure on reported results from foreign exchange and year on year complimentary pressures in Q2 which is factored into this outlook. Turning now to Slide 12, you can see our updated projections below the OIBDA line for the full year 2009. As we just discussed, our new outlook calls for OIBDA in the range of $820 million to $860 million with expected G&A down slightly to $135 million. We also expect our interest to be moderately lower based on our existing debt levels and the lower interest rates in the current environment. As a reminder, we don't forecast other income and expense or non controlling interests. The amounts you see here are the Q1 actual results. Likewise, with respect to our tax position, we've assumed that 39% structural rate plus the actual impact of discrete items reported in the first quarter. These expectations yield EPS in the range of $0.81 to $0.91 per diluted share, assuming $204 million shares outstanding. As a reminder, our first quarter results included one time impacts to other expense in our effective tax rate from changes in FX rates since the end of 2009 which reduced net income attributable to Iron Mountain by $12 million or $0.06 per diluted share. Overall, we believe we're on tract to delivering solid financial results this year.  That concludes my opening remarks and we'll now open the lines for Q&A.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Andrew Steinerman – J. P. Morgan.
Andrew Steinerman – J. P. Morgan: I want to ask about core storage growth, the tick down to 7% after the previous six quarters have been 8%, but you chose to keep your targets for the year to 9%. Could you go over your thinking there? What do you think slowed it one tick in the quarter and what might keep it a slightly upward bias for the year?
Robert Brennan: It's really tough for comps early in the year. That's the punch line for this issue.
Brian McKeon: We did have some tougher comparison. We had some impacts from larger destructions in 2008. The public service contract that we've been talking about in Europe actually had a storage component that impacted it a bit.  We are seeing some impact from the economy on storage in the sense that customers have been looking at destructions as a way to save overall costs and that is putting some pressure on the number at the margin but we're continuing to target, as we work through the year, we think we'll be looking at some more favorable comparison and should be able to improve that growth rate.
Andrew Steinerman – J. P. Morgan: Could you give us a word on how volumes are doing in shedding?
Brian McKeon: The shredding is one area that I think I was just mentioning the impacts of the economy that we are seeing some factors impacting core revenues and I think shredding is one of those areas. The activity levels has been soft and we still posted solid growth in shredding excluding paper, but it was down from the much stronger growth rates we saw last year, and that is an area that we're monitoring closely. It is an area where we're seeing some pressure.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird.
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird: I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the SG&A. You obviously did a fantastic job of controlling the cost there but I believe you also mentioned that you saw a little bit of a shift in cost this quarter. I wonder if you could detail a little bit more what that shift was and maybe event quantify what it was in the quarter and when we should expect to see that actually make up later on in the year.
Robert Brennan: I just wanted to highlight. We obviously had quite a bit of cost favorability in Q1. It was the key driver of our B versus our guidance. That's principally related to the strong cost management practices we put in place over the last year. We had some select deficiencies in Q1 I just want to highlight. We substantially scaled back our national meeting this year. We were able to execute an excellent session but that was done at a much reduced cost and that gave us some benefits. We have some select initiative investments that we are prioritizing. They are focused in the areas like advancing our DMS growth strategy that we will be initiating as we work through the year. We don't have that quantified specifically. I think what you should take away is that we will maintain a control over cost growth, be very focused and prioritized and for the full year we should have SG&A growth relatively in line with revenue growth. That's our business plan.
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird: Could you give us an idea roughly where you're at right now in terms of capacity utilization, comparing both North American and international?
Brian McKeon: We typically just focus on the North American number because we have a lot of variability depending on our stage of development in different international markets. Our building utilization remains in the 85% range. We're actually improving our utilization in much of our system where as Bob mentioned, we've been adding some capacity related to compliant federal records ahead of growth which is constraining the overall gains, but we're hoping to move that number up over time to the 90% range.
Robert Brennan: The thing I want you to hear is that we're being very careful to invest in growth opportunities and we're being very prudent on all of the costs.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Could you give us a feel for the conversations you're now having with customers in terms of their appetite for complimentary services once the economy improves? So in other words, are they saying we like the idea, just not now? Call us in six months. Is there any of that which would suggest the possibility of stronger growth at some point down the road?
Brian McKeon: There is, I think you should remember we approach every conversation from the standpoint of lowering costs. All of our solutions are focused on lowering costs. The issue that we run into in this environment is that when the costs are going to be saved over a longer time, in other words, we're asking the customer to deploy money and people up front in anticipation of long term cost savings, they're deferring in a lot of those cases. And as things improve, I expect them to defer less. But fundamentally what we're seeing is that big deals are getting smaller and taking longer and whether it's a special project or software license or in our fulfillment business, and I would expect that to improve as conditions improve. Fundamentally we feel good about the business simply because our value proposition is driven around saving money.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Any updates that you can provide on the uptake of complimentary services, the percent of customers now taking two services, the percent take three for example?
Robert Brennan: Don't have an update for you on this call.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: On real estate acquisitions, are you getting noticeably better deals now than you would have a year ago or are you still holding off on the expectation that prices could fall further?
Brian McKeon: Our real estate strategy is driven much more by the need for capacity rather than try to time the market. I would say that the key trend that we're seeing is more related to our international markets that we are seeing more favorable economics for us to own real estate versus working through leasing partners.  That's why you see some increase in our forecast through the level of real estate spending this year, and obviously market conditions are more favorable than they were. So that should benefit us over time. 
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: You mentioned the ability to naturally reduce leverage in the absence of significant acquisition activity so perhaps you could update us on the M&A outlook. Is there a pipeline so to speak or is the conservative balance sheet approach that you referenced an indication that we shouldn't expect much in that regard?
Brian McKeon: There's a pipeline. It's the same pipeline that we've had for a few quarters now. We're being very careful to make sure we form commercial partnerships where we would want to think about acquiring. It's primarily focused on digital and selective international expansion. But we're being very prudent right now and we don't feel the market running away from us by any means.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi: With regards to margins, obviously a good performance but I wanted to ask about the sustainability of the SG&A leverage and the productivity gains as internal growth ticks back to the 8% plus range that you're still projecting.
Brian McKeon: Let me differentiate. On the SG&A front just to reinforce our response to the earlier questions. You should expect SG&A to be roughly in line with our revenue growth this year. We're managing that business in a way that we're prioritizing the investments we're making and trying to control that growth. So I wouldn't project SG&A, a negative impact from SG&A or significant leverage. Kind of balance that. The productivity gains that we're driving are principally supporting the gains that you see in gross margins. There are number of other factors that are also supporting that. We've seen some favorability in areas like business mix, the pressures that we're seeing in the business are more on lower margin project sales while our higher margin storage services have sustained. We've improved our storage margins. Some of those are supported by improved trends in pricing over the last year and obviously the biggest factor is that we're driving strong productivity improvement in areas like the North American business, the initiatives that Bob was highlighting in his speech. Those factors all should sustain, so we're continuing to focus on managing the business with strong emphasis on execution. We're seeing good results from that and we should be able to sustain those improvements as we move forward. Obviously the year on year gains will moderate. We've been doing this for the past few quarters and so we'll be up against some tougher compares, but we should be able to sustain solid gross margins moving ahead. Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citi One question on CapEx, it's I believe the third quarter in a row that you've defined CapEx, is there any geography specificity or any particular kind of project that are not making the cut here? What are you preferentially investing in versus not, if you can talk on that.
Brian McKeon: It really just reflects controlled phasing of capacity additions. I would highlight that we have scaled back some of our cost estimates for elements of the U.K. expansion. We're still moving forward with that but we've just refined those estimates in how much racking do we need to bring on when, and that's a meaningful efficiency for us. It's roughly $10 million efficiency. But it really just an extension of good capital controls.
Robert Brennan: It's also just the disciplined approach to how we manage and how we evaluate these things where we're getting better and better. It's just fundamentally improving execution.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Gold – Sidoti & Co.
David Gold – Sidoti & Co.: Following up on the CapEx question, presumably on the pieces that we cut back on, should we view that more as a delay of something that will be invested in next year should the climate pick up or how is it best to think about it?
Robert Brennan: The way to think about it is that we are concentrating our investments on the biggest growth opportunities that we see around building out our digital platform, around building out our DMS business and select international expansion. As things improve, we will continue to look at those investments and how they can pay off but we feel like we have a very resilient business and we're managing well through this environment. We don't expect our management profile to change as conditions improve.
Brian McKeon: I think that's exactly right. We made good progress getting our efficiencies down. We're actually right now in line with our longer term goals for capital efficiency excluding real estate. I think this isn't about taking a project that we're going to do this year and pushing it into January. This is about being disciplined about when we need to bring on new capacity. The thing that could swing our numbers, it's more factors like if we had a significant new business opportunity to bring capacity in house. That could drive the number. Some elements of our capital additions are lumpy by nature. We're adding data center capacity or as we highlighted this year, we had a big opportunity to improve returns in specific markets by rationalizing real estate. It would be a big thing. But the underlying efficiencies should be sustained. 
David Gold – Sidoti & Co.: Presumably one thing that we're hearing from everybody out there consistently across the board, obviously not specific to your business is the environment lends itself to customers coming back and looking to renegotiate particularly on price. Can you give us a sense for what type of conversations are ongoing if you're seeing some of that pressure and basically how the trends are going, how you answer these calls, because presumably you're getting the same calls as everyone else is.
Brian McKeon: We're fortunate in that we're able to approach each conversation with our customer around lowering their total cost of their program around information management services, what they're outsourcing with us. We can give them very practical advise about how to lower their total costs which is not euphemistic with lowering their price. There are many things that they can do around which information they choose destroy, how they choose to retain it, what form factor, and so we're actually able to come out of nearly every conversation saying here are practical ways you can lower your cost which allows us to successfully manage the price issue. 
David Gold – Sidoti & Co.: On that basis, presumably, I think last quarter your commented on maybe 3% year on year price increases of growth?
Brian McKeon: We think that's appropriate given the investments we've made in the business and the level that we operate at compared to our competitors and we're committed to helping our customers lower their overall costs so that's baked into that on a sustainable basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh – Credit Suisse.,
Kevin McVeigh – Credit Suisse: I wanted to follow up on the question a little bit. As you think about the competition, have they become much more aggressive not necessarily from your client to client discussions but some of the competitors out there and how you're thinking about that.
Robert Brennan: It's always been an aggressive set of competitors that we deal with and when we look across the network and we look across Iron Mountain we feel very comfortable with our competitive position. If I were answering that as the General Manager in a local market, I'd say oi, it's very difficult. There's a lot of competitive pressure. ' Having said that, we have a value proposition that we believe is unmatched by our competitors from the smallest account to the largest and we feel very comfortable with that position. There's business where we're getting picked off based on price but we're okay with that. It's not something that's adversely affecting our overall business. Our value proposition stands alone and we're going to get the value that we think it deserves.
Kevin McVeigh – Credit Suisse: The reduction in the CapEx of the $40 million, the $10 million on the racking that was helpful. The other components, was that on the digital side or real estate? Could you help us understand what that was a little bit more?
Brian McKeon: It was a variety of factors. Just to give you some context to try to see this in the year end call, but we build a plan as we enter the year based on what people believe, within our business we believe we need to execute against our growth agenda. We obviously get updated estimates and refine those as we look at the projects on a more detailed basis. Part of our process now is we have a disciplined capital committee approach where we go through and really question when do we need to bring some things on line and that creates some efficiencies. We had some contingencies in for some new business opportunities on acquiring some business that we think are going to be somewhat lower than we had earmarked, and we had some efficiencies as we looked at areas like the U.K. expansion. So it's not one thing specifically. I would say the principal throughout our approach has been we're not going to back off on our growth agenda. Let's just be as efficient as we can on how we fund that.
Robert Brennan: The think I want you to hear is we're getting better at this and the way that we think about this. We're better at it.
Kevin McVeigh – Credit Suisse: The margins look really strong with seasonally quarter, so nice job on the margins.
Operator: Your next questions come from Edward Atorino – Benchmark.
Edward Atorino – Benchmark: On the CapEx, I believe CapEx had been running at 12% to 13% of sales. Is that going to trend down normally as you exercise your discipline? And second, could you talk a little bit more about the acquisition landscape? I can't believe there are a lot of opportunities is storage but in the digital arena, the size of deals you might be looking at, can they be handled without necessarily ratcheting up debt? 
Brian McKeon: On your first question, there are factors that should naturally benefit our capital ratios over time. One is the strategic to grow our services revenues at a faster rate than storage. That should create capital efficiency and we're seeing some of the benefit where in the past we were really 100% volume driven, now we're getting relatively more of our growth still within a modest range, but relatively more of our growth in factors like pricing. So those factors should benefit us over time and we feel good about the progress that we've driven. We think we can at least sustain that and that's our intent as we move forward.
Robert Brennan: From a digital M&A perspective, remember there are three platforms that we have; data protection, archival and E discovery and we see opportunities to add to those platforms. Fundamentally the market right now, if you're a small venture backed start up trying to sell technology into the enterprise is really tough. We think that that will favor us as we look at those opportunities.
Brian McKeon: In terms of the financing, I think we start by looking at what we think is a reasonable leverage range for our company and we've historically been in the four to five times range and now we're obviously below that. We think actually in the near term it's probably proven to be in a slightly lower range, perhaps 3.5 to 4.5 and we'll look at any acquisition in that context and we believe that's the right capital structure for the company so we'll look at our deployment for a specific acquisitions in that context.
Edward Atorino – Benchmark: On natural deleveraging would result in a trend down ward of interest expense I would guess and G&A might start to level off and you get some interesting bottom line dynamics out of that I suspect.
Brian McKeon: I think you're seeing some of that. We took up the EPS number.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Could you speak a bit to your largest vertical, financial services, core and potentially complimentary I think you alluded to, what type of activity you're seeing good and bad there.
Robert Brennan: Good goes back to my opening comments so in the litigation associated with everything that's going on in that sector, we have services through our Stratify acquisition that we're able to offer that we're actually doing quite well and we're helping our customers quite a bit. There's also as consolidation occurs in that space, helping people rationalize retention programs, helping them understand what can be destroyed. So we're able to give them some practical advise which allow us to sustain our business in that sector despite everything that they're going through
Brian McKeon: I would say it's as expected. We expected to see pressures on the discretionary front and that's what we've seen and I think we expected to sustain our strong storage relationships, customer relationships and that's been the case as well. Obviously some consolidation going on, but we're managing through that well.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Any interesting developments in other verticals beyond that?
Robert Brennan: We've actually put a lot of focus into health care and you've heard me talk about our medical imagery archive offering, and there's a lot of attention coming from the stimulus package into that so I think the natural dynamics of moving electronic health care records, the fact that we can help them with that with out sourcing, we feel very good about the way that vertical is building. We feel very pleased with the investment that we made over the last year and a half in government. As I mentioned in my remarks, we've got a third of that capacity already booked, more than a third and we believe that as contractors to federal government start to realize the constraints that they have to face around how they store things, that that will be a larger and larger business for us. So those would be the two that I'd call out that we feel real good about.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Are you doing any partnerships on the health care front with regard to capturing stimulus money or is that something that's a really big opportunity independently?
Robert Brennan: I don't know. We're just looking at that. There's just a lot of attention going into that sector right now, but it would be premature for me to talk about. We're just looking at that in terms of capturing part of that package, but it's very early.
Scott Schneeberger – Oppenheimer: Could you give us any insight into how April is progressing or the progression through the first quarter on a monthly basis of just the business activity that you saw? You alluded to litigation activity in Stratify, with specific to that and then broader.
Brian McKeon: Just as a matter of policy, we don't comment on in quarter trends but we were comfortable with our outlook and I think we're on track for a good year this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Franco Turinelli– William Blair & Co.
Franco Turinelli – William Blair & Co.: You were talking about the leverage continuing to come down and it is now below what you've historically indicated as your level of comfort. I understand all the reasons for doing that in the current environment, but nevertheless it's not clear to me with just letting cash build up on the balance sheet is the right approach here. Is your thought maybe to pay down some of the debt or is something else in the capital structure point of view, but it might be important for us to understand as we think about the future here?
Brian McKeon: I think picking up on the theme that you mentioned, this is obviously impacted by the current environment and we do think it's prudent to maintain flexibility. So we're operating in a way that's a little outside of our normal and we think that's okay just given some of the uncertainty. We're not changing our strategy in terms of acquisitions. We want to maintain flexibility on that front. I would highlight that we will consider actions to strengthen our financial position as appropriate so where there are opportunities to extend our debt maturities and revisit the right balance in terms of our debt structure, we're going to take advantage of that. Over time, we've said that we intend to drive our cash generation capacity as a company and look at other options as well as returning cash to shareholders. We're not anticipating any announcements on that front in the near term given the current environment, but that's obviously an option that we'd certainly consider in the context of being appropriately balanced from a value creation point of view. So right now we think we're okay in terms of how we're managing it and we're certainly considering the factors that you're highlighting.
Franco Turinelli – William Blair & Co.: As I look at that 7% core internal growth rate, M&A factor in what you said on pricing around 3% then 4% is left for growth from volume. Can you help us think through a little bit about what's going on in this current environment? Are you in fact seeing fewer records coming in to the facilities but maybe lower destructions? Just give us some help on the volume side as well.
Brian McKeon: I just want to clarify one thing. The 3% that we refer to is the North American storage growth rate. It's not the simple math to go from the 7% for the company to that. There's obviously business mix impacts. It's more complicated. So I just wanted to highlight that.
Robert Brennan: We see some pressures. If one bank acquires another, and there's a lot of layoffs, those records may lay dormant for awhile. As Brian said before, there are customers that are looking to save over the long term by doing more distributions and we're seeing some higher distribution activities. So there's more variability on the margin, but we feel very good about the business in general and our ability to drive to the projections that we've made. There were tougher comps.
Brian McKeon: Our own projections for storage gains are primarily driven by volume gains, so we feel quite comfortable with the volume trends.
Franco Turinelli – William Blair & Co.: That seems like an important comment. You're saying that the projections for internal growth are primarily driven from volume gains with price being helpful but not a necessary factor?
Brian McKeon: I would say that our projections for storage gains globally are principally driven by volume.
Robert Brennan: Thank you everybody. We appreciate your time and attention this morning and we look forward to speaking to you again on July 30.

Operator: Good morning, my name is Vanda and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain fourth quarter 2008 earnings webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any backgrounds noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instruction) Thank you. Mr. Golden, you may begin your conference.
Stephen Golden:  Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to our 2008 fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. After my announcement this morning, Bob Brennan will give his state of the company remarks, followed by Brian McKeon, who will deliver the financial review. When Brian is finished, we will open up the phones for Q&A. For those of you here in Boston, we will be presenting at the Robert Baird 2009 Business Solutions Conference at the Four Seasons Hotels later this afternoon. For our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to slide two. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2009 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release or the Safe Harbor language on this slide, and our most recently filed 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, operating income before D&A or OIBDA, free cash flow before acquisitions and investments and other non-GAAP measures are metrics we speak too frequently, and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliations of various non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. With that, I would like to introduce our CEO, Bob Brennan.
Robert Brennan: Thank you, Stephen. Good morning and welcome to our year-end conference call. The format of today's call: I’ll cover our business performance in 2008 as well as the progress we made against our strategy and a few remarks on how I feel about this coming year.  Brian will then review details of our financial performance and provide guidance for 2009. And afterwards we will take Q&A both Brian and I. But before I get into 2008, I want to [share] some key messages with you. First and foremost the business at Iron Mountain is doing very well. Our business is performing, the team is doing a good job, the core business itself is particularly strong and continues to strengthen. We are managing well and improving both capability and execution and this is evidenced by the fact that we hit our 2008 targets and we expect to produce solid results in 2009, where we improved our cash flow and balance sheet and advance against our strategy with significant progress across all of our business segments, and I’ll touch up on that in a few minutes. Now we are experiencing some pressures from foreign exchange, paper commodity prices, which drop dramatically in the back half of last year, as well as customers deferring on some purchases with our complementary revenue. Despite those pressures though we expect solid performance in 2009. Now let’s drop back and take a look at 2008. First of all, we had a good Q4. OIBDA is at the high end of the range. We did expect pressures on complementary revenue, which represent about 14% of the total revenues. There were impacts from the completion of two public sector projects as well as lower paper prices and project sales customers did defer in some cases and continued to defer in some cases. So then the question is how did we hit the numbers? First revenue. Core revenue growth was solid across all of our business units and remained solid. Just as reminder, core revenues are the bulk of our revenues. In other words they are the other 86%. These results are driven in large part by North America. Our North American business just keep in better execution as well as realizing value for the services we provide in the market where we have significant competitive events. Core revenues for quarter was 9% with solid 7% internal growth. So in addition to solid revenue growth, we also hit the numbers through disciplined execution against control and costs. We are very careful about which costs we grow, which investments get prioritized, we’re also been very careful about driving efficiency into our organization and in some cases make targeted reductions because we’ve realized inefficiency. This is all a function of performance management that has been taking place and then a primary focus of ours for the last few years. We have been increasingly disciplined about how we managed the business and it’s showing in our results. For 2008 revenue was up 12% and OIBDA was up 13%. Capital efficiency improved with CapEx at 10.8% of revenue excluding real estate and free cash flows are 182 million before real estate and acquisitions, well ahead of our original expectations. Iron Mountain is financially stronger entering 2009 with our leverage down at 3.8 times and hasn’t been that for a long time. Our cash capacity stands at $775 million and we have no debt obligations until 2012. In other words, business performed well. Our team is doing a good job and our value proposition despite all the pressures in the economy continues to resonate with our customers, is driven by driving that cost and driving out and reducing risk and that’s particularly helpful in these times. So let me talk about progress against our strategy in 2008. Many of you know we’ve employed a consistent time tested three-phase approach. And what I want you to know is that and what I’m really trying to bring for life in the next few minutes is that we needn’t compromise on our strategic agenda hit our target last year. And we are not going to compromise on it this year. We believe we can walk into them at the same time that we can perform and pursue a solid strategic growth agenda. So the three phases that mentioned - for those of you that have been following these notes, Phase 1 is build the platform and market some products. Phase 2 is build distribution into those markets and Phase 3 is not capitalizing on the business driving growth and returns. So let’s start with the North American Physical Business. It is a great business and it’s squarely in Phase 3 driving growth and returns. We do as I mentioned before, we have significant competitive advantage here. We made solid progress strengthening this business. While we improved returns but we remained growth focussed. Some areas of growth for us where I’m going to talk about some relatively small businesses relative to the market opportunity, where we have made great progress and have strong potentials. Our Document Management Solution Business. Think about this as taking the box business and getting to what’s inside the box and helping customers with their workflow from imaging to physical to digital conversion. This is the business where we’ve dedicated focus. We tremendously increased our sale capability as well as our service delivery capability in the past year and we are very bullish about the business over the short, medium and long term. Our healthcare focus, obviously this is an exploring market with the proliferation of records in the healthcare segment and just the math that occurs between physical and the digital records and we can help customers across that spectrum. I’m taking over a file room for a hospital to doing their medical image archiving. Relatively small business for us today, but we see a large market opportunity. And in the government sector and just a last few years, we’ve been very much focussed and provided a dedicated team against selling to the government as well as helping our customers who had to be compliant with federal records because days sales is up and with invested significant capital against this final touch in a few months relative to our facilities, with small dedicated teams, small business today we see great growth potential going forward. So this is North America, while we are producing strong return setting long lines into the future. In terms of returns, the same story often been for a few years i.e. productivity focussed on our real estate, network focussed on our transportation network, our workflow we’re doing a good job here. We go market-by-market. We’re making steady progress that is sustainable for years to come in driving more efficiency at our business and we continue to get value for the services that we provide. And we’re pleased with the progress we’re making on that front. So net-net North American Physical, great business managed by a great team. I expect solid performance from that team in our business this year. Let’s move to International. International is a key component of our growth agenda. This is a business that’s been developed through acquisitions, joint ventures as well as organic growth. So, we are really in all three phases of the business. Now International is behind North America in returns but it’s a business with great potential where we believe we can pursue North American like return over time. The key story is that we did consolidate leadership in this segment in the last year and really upgraded management. Marc Duale is now in charge of International Asset segment and we upgraded management across the continent of Europe with our country managers over the last couple of years as well as in our Australian business. We’ve also had a great deal of success building joint ventures internationally. If you look at some of our better performing businesses in Chile, Peru and Mexico, these came from ex-joint ventures where we’ve done 15 events, eight have resulted in acquisition. Those eight are performing very well. And today we’re incubating joint ventures with very strong partners in Russia, China, Turkey, India and other emerging economies where it takes a long time. These are flywheel businesses. Building our Storage business takes a long time but we believe we can establish the same competitive advantage we have in North America and build a very strong business with a very long haul. We’re also continuing to build out distribution capability, having invested in sales capability in continental Europe where we are seeing strong benefits from that. And in our largest businesses, Australia and U.K., it is very much like North America. It’s about driving growth and returns and we follow a similar playbook. In Australia and U.K., we bought lower return businesses but we know we can improve those returns by focusing on revenue growth and penetrating our customer base, driving basically up selling and cost selling our existing base and to cost and performance management that were familiar with the playbook and we know the potential in these businesses because we see that in our Latin American businesses, which drive very high growth and returns and of course we see that in our North American business. So, we expect improved incremental financial performance and scale out of International as we go forward. So, now if I can just turn our attention to Digital. Digital is about 7% of our business today and we expect to increase that overtime. But we are still building up the platform. There are three legs to this platform. There is data protection, also known as backup, archival and eDiscovery. Together that's a platform for providing digital storage and service where we are the leader and with attention created the category. In building out that platform we announced a few key products in the past year, one through acquisition, which was the acquisition of Stratify. This is a great acquisition for us. It's a very hot market. It's a wonderful team. We had no turnover and they performed admirably against their targets. We’re very pleased with the acquisition of Stratify and what that can do for us going forward. We also announced the product that we previewed for you on Investor Day called Virtual File Store. We announced it this week. Think of it as a box, this is all over again. We are going to IT organizations announcing give us your inactive data. It doesn’t belong on your primary computer systems. We can store it more securely and more cost effectively than you can and I don’t want people who don’t want to spend money on capital expenses, that’s resonating. We are very proud about the potential of the product. We also built data distribution capability during the past year having announced significant partnerships with Microsoft where they came to us as the experts for doing cloud recovery because we are the leaders in digital storages and service. So we are the cloud recovery offerings to their data protection management product. McKesson and HP use us as the service provider for their medical image archive technology. IBM partners with us through their FileNet Group for perspective record management. And it's again that’s where we have the brand, that’s where we have the expertise in the permission with our customers. And within our eDiscovery platform with Stratify we are getting very significant traction through strong partnerships with TWC and Navigant. But it’s our brand and it’s our expertise that has these industry giant seek us out. I want to make no mistakes about the tough times that is on store for us. Sales cycles are longer. People are scrutinizing ROIs. Customers are delaying whenever they can. It’s a hard time to be in the technology business. But one should remember that most of our business is recurring and already under contract. We have a recurring business model and our value proposition is around saving money. So we feel very comfortable with the shakeout that’s going to occur in this stage. We are going to be a net beneficiary of it and there is going to be a lot shakeout to the small firm just unable to sell our stock. So, if we backout against that, Digital had a very good year making strategic progress as did International, as did our North American Physical Business. Let’s talk a little bit about 2009. As we head into 2009, we remain focused on the strategy that got us here. But there are some key points that I want you to consider. First of all, we are tracking to plan. Iron Mountain is also a good start against our growth and productivity agendas across all of our business segments. We expect to hit our targets despite significant pressures on the complementary revenue that 14% of our revenue where we are subject to lower paper prices. There is pressure on project revenues and customers are hunkering down as it relates to making discretionary investments. We’ll also see pressure on our reported results from foreign exchange, but this does not affect the underlying strength of our business. Business is strong and that strength is reflected in our targets of solid core revenue growth and even help your profit gains. Let me just talk for a minute about how we are managing in this environment. We are being very disciplined about where we grow costs, rich growth and capital investments we make and calibrating our spend to reflect both pressures in the market as well as the opportunity. We are pushing the team hard and they are responding. So while we are managing the business tightly making sharp choices, we’re also very much committed to investing against our strategic agenda. Key initiatives this year will include advancing our document management services and solutions business. We have unique competitive advantage here. We already have the facilities. We have got to be at the customer’s records. We have the people who have made the investments, so we have a unique competitive offering here and we will scale that business aggressively. We will also focus on scaling digital users. They just pointed out through the partnerships that I mentioned. We have permission to become the de facto offsite store for businesses. And we will focus on strengthening our global footprint both through improving returns in established markets like the U.K. and increasing growth capacity in markets around Latin America and Continental Europe. We will also remain sharply focused on enabling long-term return improvement through smart concentrated investments in our core business. We’ve really continued to drive standardization of workflow, including a relentless focus on securing our customer’s information assets. We’ll be focussed on realizing value to the investments we make. So in closing, I just want you to know that we are very pleased with the fact that we hit our targets and advanced our strategy in 2008. And I want you to know that I’m confident and the team is confident that we can deliver solid performance like the current [phase] and build value for the very long term. So with that if I could just turn it over to Brian McKeon, our Chief Financial Officer. Brian?
Brian McKeon: Thanks Bob. Good morning everyone. Q4 was another solid quarter for Iron Mountain, highlighted by healthy internal revenue growth and strong OIBDA gains. Storage revenues, which comprised 55% of our total revenues and are a key financial driver, grew 8% organically in the quarter. Core service revenues representing another 31% of revenues posted 11% internal growth. As expected, the record recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar did lower reported revenue and OIBDA growth in Q4. Similar to Q3, unusually large exchange rate changes also recorded as to recognize charges in other expense in our booked tax provision, which lowered our reported EPS by about $0.20 per share. These factors however don’t alter the fundamental suaveness of our business, which performed well throughout the year. For the full year, we delivered against all of our financial objectives posting 8% internal revenue growth, 13% comparable OIBDA growth and significant improvements in capital efficiency. Today we will review our quarterly results and provide an update on our full year 2008 cash flow performance, capital spending and our current debt position. We will also provide an update perspective on our 2009 guidance. Let’s turn to slide four, which highlights the key messages from today’s review. The first key message you should here today is that we continue to drive solid business performance, reflecting the strength and resiliency of our business model. In Q4 we delivered 9% internal growth in combined core storage and service revenues. We also drove a 11% comparable growth in OIBDA in spite negative foreign exchange impacts and pressures from lower recycled paper pricing. We continue to execute with discipline and leverage strong Q4 performance to deliver against our 2008 financial objectives. Revenues exceeded $3 billion for the first time in our history and we delivered 8% internal revenue growth for the full year, solidly within our forecasted range. OIBDA finished the year at $783 million at the high-end of our guidance, we originally issued a year ago, 13% year-on-year growth in OIBDA excluding asset gains and losses was supported by strong gains in gross profit and tight cost controls. We also strengthened our liquidity and leverage ratio this year. At year-end we had over $775 million in total liquidity including more than $500 million of availability under our revolving credit facility, which is supported by well-diversified bank group. We ended the year with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.8 times OIBDA moderately below our long-term target range, reflecting our heightened focus on cash management. We have a free cash flow positive business before acquisition, so these positions should continue to strengthen in the absence of significant acquisition activity. We intend to build on our financial progress in 2009 with goals for solid underlying operating performance. Our outlook in corporate expectations for continued solid momentum in our North American business where we are driving strengthened returns to enhance focus on execution. As noted on our last conference call, the unusual strengthening of the U.S. dollar in recent months will pressure our reporting results in 2009. At current rates we expect foreign exchange will lower reported growth by about 7%. Large recent declines in commodity such as recycled paper will also constrain near-term results. We’ll review our updated 2009 guidance in more detail today, isolating impacts from these factors to highlight the underlying strength of our financial outlook. Let’s begin with the review of the details of our Q4 performance starting with a look at our revenue growth performance in slide five. Slide five breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions in foreign exchange. As a remainder, we removed the 2007 and 2008 revenues associated with the divested product sales business from our internal growth calculations. Overall, we drove solid growth in the quarter although reported revenue gains were constrained by negative foreign exchange rate impacts and lower benefits from acquisitions. Internal revenue growth for the quarter was solid at 7%. As noted core internal revenue growth was up a strong 9% supported by 8% storage growth and a 11% core service growth. Storage gains were solid across our key businesses. Strong core service growth was supported by gains in North America including benefits from fuel surcharges and strengthened pricing. Overall internal revenue growth gains were moderated by 6% decline in complementary revenues. As expected, we saw pressure in Q4 due to the completion of a major European public service contract over the last year that resulted in $5 million reduction in revenues in the quarter. While recycle paper prices also impacted complementary service revenue in the quarter by approximately $4 million. Together these factors caused a 9% negative impact to Q4 complementary revenue growth. We’ve also seen lower growth in areas such as fulfillment services and software license sales, which are areas more likely to be impacted by economic conditions. As we noted in the past, complementary service revenue, which represents about 14% of overall revenues can fluctuate over time, given fluctuations in demand and timing for special project activity as well as variations in factors such as recycled paper pricing. Despite these impacts, our overall internal growth rates remained solid throughout the year and we delivered against our full year internal growth goals. Slide six compares the P&L results for this quarter to Q4 2007 and brings down our revenue growth by business segment. As shown here, we delivered solid OIBDA gains despite pressure from foreign exchange and lower complementary revenues. Reported revenues reached $753 million in Q4, up 4% supported by solid storage growth across our business. On a constant dollar basis, revenues grew 8% while OIBDA grew 13%. Our largest segment, North America Physical posted strong core revenue internal growth of 10% and 7% internal growth overall. We saw solid growth across our records management and data protection and secure shredding product lines. Overall growth was supported by solid storage gains and strengthened core service revenues. These gains were offset by declining recycled paper prices and anticipated softness in more discretionary areas such as special projects and fulfillment revenues. Our International Physical business reported internal growth of 4% supported by continued strength in our Latin American business and solid storage internal growth in Europe As expected, we saw declines in complementary service revenues in Europe as the second major project we have been speaking was concluded in the third quarter. These declines reduced International revenues by $5 million or about 3% in the quarter. In addition, significantly weakened foreign currencies reduced our reported results in the segment by approximately 11 percentage points. Our Digital segment also drove strong revenue growth with 26% gains overall supported by a 11% internal growth and continued solid performance from Stratify. We saw solid growth in storage revenues and as expected some weakness in more discretionary purchase areas such as software license sales. Operational gains in our North American Physical segment drove improvement in gross profit. Gross margins were up a 150 basis points for the quarter, compared to the same prior year period, supported by productivity gains and improved storage gross margins in North America. Gross margins also benefitted from the sale of the low margin data product sales business. Year-on-year SG&A growth was 3% in the quarter slightly below the rate of revenue growth. SG&A cost growth moderated as expected in the fourth quarter reflecting our tight focus on execution and cost control. OIBDA, which grew 9% on a reported basis to $199 million in Q4 of 2008, included $3 million of asset write-offs related to building moves in North America. Note that our Q4 2007 results included a $1 million net gain on asset dispositions. On a comparable basis, excluding asset gains and losses, OIBDA grew 11% in Q4 2008 compared to Q4 2007. Depreciation was $64 million and amortization was $9 million for the quarter. The year-on-year increase in D&A was driven primarily by amortization related to the Stratify acquisition completed in December 2007. Operating income was $126 million for Q4, up 10% versus the prior year, in line with our OIBDA gains. Slide seven bridges our Q4 operating income and net income and EPS results. While we drove solid operating income gains in Q4, our net income and EPS were negatively impacted by charges related to large recent changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As noted operating income for that quarter was up 10% to $226 million, supported by strong gains on the gross profit line in moderating growth and depreciation, reflecting tight capital controls and the absence of acquisitions in the quarter. Our Q4 interest expense was $57 million, down 3% from Q4 2007 due primarily to decreases in our net debt and weighted average interest rate. These gains were offset by impact of other expense in our effective tax rate from changes in FX rates since the end of the third quarter, which reduce net income by $40 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in Q4. As a result, we reported net income for the quarter of $1 million or $0.01 per diluted share. As we discussed in our last earnings call, large fluctuations in foreign currencies during a quarter can result in meaningful accounting effects as we mark our forward contracts in debt to market, and record the appropriate tax effects from these changes. In Q4, FX changes drove us net $16 million charge in other expense. We also recorded a $24 million tax provision on these amounts, reflecting both foreign currency gain and losses incurred in different tax jurisdictions. As noted on our last call, well large changes in FX can impact our reported results. Two economic impacts to our business are mitigated by some key factors. First as a service company, our costs are matched with our revenues in local currencies. We’ve also aligned our international assets and liabilities in the same currency with international net asset positions at 90% hedged. Finally, our International businesses are funded with local currency cash flows and debt financing. As such we are not exposed to reliance and repatriation of funds from our international operations. We’ll continue to highlight the discrete impact from FX changes and reporting our results to reinforce the strength of our underlying business performance. In Q4, the impact of foreign currency rate changes increased our effective tax rate by about 60 basis points. Discrete items such as FIN 48 interest addition to tax reserves and other adjustments also added in that 5% to our effective tax rate in the quarter. For the full year, our tax rate before the impact of foreign currency rate changes and other discrete items was 38%. We are estimating our tax rate before the impact of foreign currency rate changes and other discrete items for 2009 to be approximately 39%. Let’s now turn to slide eight to look at our full year performance. Our solid Q4 performance supported strong full year results at the high-end of our original full year goals for revenue and OIBDA growth. For the full year, we achieved all of our stated financial goals: 10% to 13% revenue growth; 10% to 14% OIBDA growth excluding asset gains and losses and improved capital efficiency. Balance growth across our key businesses and service lines drove solid overall revenue gains of 12% and internal growth of 8%. Acquisitions added another 3% and year-over-year favorable currency changes added about 1% to revenue growth. OIBDA growth of 13% excluding asset gains and losses were supported by 14% growth in gross profit reflecting our focus on operational execution, particularly in North America. Net income and EPS declined to reflect the impact of foreign exchange rate changes or other expense in our effective tax rate. Other expense was $31 million in 2008 versus $3 million in 2007. Our effective tax increased to 64% in 2008 versus 31% in 2007. Combined foreign exchange impacts and the related tax provision reduced net income by $69 million, or $0.34 per diluted share in 2008. Also included in our 2008 results is $0.02 per share impact of net losses on our asset dispositions. As a reminder, our 2007 results benefited approximately [$0.80] per share from net gains and asset dispositions and a lower effective tax rate due to the impact of foreign currency rate changes and other discrete items. Absence of these impacts we drove solid underlying profit growth in 2008. It’s important to note that the impact of foreign exchange changes on our tax rate were primarily non-cash in nature. Let’s now shift to reviewing drivers of our cash flow performance, which improved solid in 2008. Slide nine summarizes our capital spending for the year compared to 2007 full year results. We made significant progress against our capital efficiency growth in 2008 with CapEx before discretionary investments in real estate representing 10.8% of revenues. This is down 270 basis points from the comparable measure in 2007. Our total CapEx for 2008 was $373 million including $44 million through real estate. Semi controls on our capital spending and increased asset utilization rates were key drivers of improved capital efficiency in 2008. Additionally, we deferred a portion of our data center expansion into 2009. We remain focused on aggressively driving efficiencies on our capital spending while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help to drive long-term return improvement. We’ll review our updated projections for 2009, which looked to extend this solid progress as part of our guidance discussion. Let's now move to slide ten and look at our free cash flow for the year. Slide ten highlights our cash flow performance for the year compared to 2007. For 2008, free cash flow before acquisition and discretionary investments in real estate was a $182 million well above our original forecast range. The year-on-year increase in free cash flow is supported by solid OIBDA growth and tighter control over capitals expenditures - capital expenditures, reflecting the benefits of our disciplined approach to managing the business. Also included in the cash flows from operating activities is a $24 million realized cash gain in our British pound-hedging contract that rolled over on the fourth quarter of 2008. Relatively low levels of cash tax payments supported strong cash flow this year. Cash paid for taxes in 2008 was $44 million as we benefitted from the use of past NOLs and a change in U.S. law that allowed for accelerated depreciation on most U.S. property additions. In 2009, excuse me, we expect our cash paid for taxes to be approximately $50 million to $55 million including the benefit of continued accelerated depreciation provisions contained in the recently inactive stimulus package. We discussed our projected free cash flow for 2009 in the outlook section of today's presentation. Now let's turn to slide 11 for review of our current debt and liquidity position. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity. In terms of our debt portfolio we ended 2008 in a very strong position. Our weighted average interest rate is down 7% and were 80% fixed. Maturity is now at 7.2 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2012.  Consolidated leverage at year-end was 3.8 times below the low-end of our target range of four to five times OIBDA and well within our 5.5 times covenant limit. As we’ve discussed in the past, our business will naturally delivered we choose in for acquisitions. With the modest level of acquisitions spending in 2008, in the benefits of our just when focussed on operating cash management, we saw significant improvement in leverage ratios and liquidity this year.  We currently have over $275 million in cash and $500 million in additional borrowing capacity. As Bob mentioned in his opening remarks, we’ve a very strong balance sheet and we're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. While we maintain a strong operating outlook, we anticipate in maintaining a more conservative approach to cash management in the current environment.  This concludes over review of Q4 and full year 2008 results. In summary, we’re very pleased with our results this year, both operationally and financially. Operationally, we’re particularly pleased with our progress and strengthening our core North American business, which is the engine for our financial performance while expanding our international and digital growth platforms.  Financially, we delivered our financial goals this year in a tough environment while strengthening our balance sheet and cash flow performance. Let’s now turn to page 12 and discuss how we intend to build on this progress in 2009 to review of our financial guidance. In terms of our guidance for 2009 there are three key methods you should hear today. The first is that we intent to sustain solid internal revenue growth in 2009 supported by 8% to 9% core internal revenues gains. As demonstrated to our recent performance, our recurring storage revenues remain strong and we believe we can sustain solid quarter service revenue growth in 2009. We also intend to drive strong comparable OIBDA gains at or above the rate of revenue growth. Our objectives in 2009 are of 8% to 13% growth in OIBDA on a constant dollar basis, building on our solid 2008 results. As we’ll discuss some more detail later about 3% of this growth is related to certain of our vehicle operating leases now being classified as capital leases upon renewal. These objectives reflects the solid progress we’re driving across our business including benefits from pricing and productivity initiatives on our North American business, and a discipline approach to cost management across the company. Finally, well our underlying business fundamentals remain solid we do expect pressure on our reported results from significant recent changes in foreign exchange rates and recycle paper pricing. We estimate that FX changes will reduce reported growth rates by about 7% in 2009. Commodity prices, which declined dramatically in Q4 will add pressure to complementary revenues and lower our internal growth rate in 2009 by about 2%.  Let’s review our outlook in more detail starting with the breakdown of our revenue growth guidance. Table on slide 13 shows our expectations for internal growth and total growth in 2009 including impacts from FX and acquisitions. In terms of our core revenues, which represent 86% of our total revenues currently we’re targeting sustain strong 8% to 9% internal growth in 2009. We expect our core storage trends to remain solid across our business. We also expect benefits in 2009 from efforts we’ve been advancing to improve our pricing for storage and for services, which is adding support to our growth outlook. We believe the core internal revenue growth is the best measure of the underlying health of our business, and we expect to sustain solid performance on this front in 2009.  While core revenues will remain strong, we’re planning for pressure on complementary revenues, which will constrain our overall internal growth to 5% to 7%. This outlook is consistent with our preliminary outlook for 7% and 9% growth showed at Investor Day adjusted for the record downturn in the recycle paper pricing experienced since October. We estimate the changes in commodity prices will reduce our overall growth rate by 2% this year.  The 10% to 20% projected decline in complementary revenues also factors and impacts from the recent completion of a large public sector project at Europe and expected pressures on more discretionary revenues in the current economic climate. To put this in context, the 10% to 20% decrease in complementary revenues equates to approximately $40 million to $80 million on revenue reduction before our $3 billion accompanist. As we noted many times in the past, complementary revenues do fluctuate in our business but we want to reinforce that this represents the smaller part of our overall revenue base. Combined with the estimated 7% impact from the record strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the second half of 2008 we’re projecting reported revenues to be flat to down moderate in 2009. Let’s spent a moment reviewing the impact of commodity prices and foreign exchange impacts, as these effects will be greater in the first three quarters of the year. As we discussed we’ve seen some dramatic changes in factors such as recycle paper pricing and foreign currency exchange rates in recent months. At current rate these factors will combined to lower reported revenue growth by 9% to 10% in 2009 with greater impacts in Q1 through Q3. In terms of recycle paper pricing the October to December 2008 timeframe so the fastest EPS decline in the reported history in the paper market. Market pricing for sorted office paper drops from levels and excess of $200 per tonne from much of last year to below $90 per tonne recently. As shown in the left hand chart above we’ve generated over $90 million of revenue from recycle paper sales last year during periods on average market pricing was an excess of $200 million per tonne.  A current rates we expect that commodity price changes including lower fuel surcharges were lower overall revenue growth by about 2% this year with greater impacts on the first three quarters. Foreign exchange changes will also have a more significant effect on a reported growth in Q1 through Q3 with negative impacts in the 8% to 9% range. It’s important to reinforce that FX movements don’t impact the underlying fundamentals of our business. As a service business our revenues in cost are aligned international markets and we continue to target solid underlying operating performance.  As we report our performance in 2009 we’ll enhance our use of constant dollar growth rates to highlight or underlying operating trends. With now turn to slide 15 to review our internal growth projections by business. Slide 15, highlights our expectation for internal growth rates across our three business segments. For our North American physical segment, which finish the year within 8% internal growth rate, we’re expecting 2009 internal growth to be in the 5% to 7% range. This outlook reflects consisting performance in core revenue growth is supported by solid toward revenue gains. This gains will be moderated by some of our complementary service revenue including impacts from lower recycle paper pricing. For our international physical segment we are projecting internal growth in the 46% range. 2008 was a good year in a international supported by solid in growth rates core revenue partially offset by pressures and complementary services due to the completion of two large projects was to be working through some comparisons do these project revenues in early 2009, which will lower internal growth rate for the year by 2%. Similar to the North American business we’re targeting strong core revenue growth rates in our international operations building in our solid moment in these markets. Finally, which respect to worldwide Digital segment we’re targeting a internal growth rate of 7 or 12% this year. What we expect to solid growth contribution from our expanding – business we are calibrating our new business growth expectations for digital in the current environment. Given pressures on customers IT budgets we’re planning for software performance in areas such as software license sales contributing to our moderate growth outlook. Slide 16, corporate these projections into our overall guidance for 2009. Slide 16 summarizes our full year 2009 in Q1 outlook. As noted we are targeting 5% to 7% internal revenue growth overall with flat to moderate declines in reported revenues reflecting the estimated negative 7% impact on foreign exchange changes. With respect to OIBDA we are targeting 8% to 13% cost in currency growth. In 2008 primarily due to the softening vehicle resale market the residual values are our vans and trucks decline to a level where certain vehicle leases that previously met the requirements to considered operating leases are now classified as capital leases or bond renewal. As a result included in OIBDA in 2009 is $21 million of reduced rental expense. Offsetting the reduction in our rent expenses or increases in depreciation and interest expense. As such there will be limited impact from this change to net income. Our capital expenditures of approximately $420 million include $20 million for the – triangle real estate project in London and $12 million for new capacity to store compliance have records in the U.S. which is a key growth initiative for us. For the first quarter we are projecting revenues of $710 million to $730 million and OIBDA of $170 million to $180 million. We expected greater pressure on reported results from foreign exchange changes and year-on-year complimentary revenues pressures in Q1, which is factored into the dollar. Turning to slide 17 you can see our expectations for the P&L below the OIBDA line for the full year 2009. As discussed both OIBDA and D&A plus interest have been increased by approximately $21 million as a result of our vehicle leases now been classified as capital leases. We are expecting our structural tax to be 39% for 2009. As noted we expect this to continue variability in the effective tax rate relate to FX changes and other discrete items such as FIN 48 interest, tax order activity and changes in tax loss or our tax reserves. As discussed earlier FX changes impacted our 2008 EPS by $0.34 per share. We also saw at $0.02 per share impact in 2008 from net losses on asset dispositions. Our expected 2009 EPS assumes no impact on future FX changes discrete tax items are asset dispositions. In terms of free cash flow we intent to build on our strong 2008 performance with goals for free cash flow before real estate acquisitions of $130 million to $170 million.  In summary 2008 was a solid year as disciplined management and strong execution draw the successful achievement of our financial objectives. Our business fundamentals are solid and we expect to build on those results in 2009. We’ve a strong balance sheet and we’re very well positioned from our liquidity perspective to fund our objectives.  Thank you and we’ll now open the phones to take a questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Hi guys. I wanted to ask about pricing on the storage side. Are you seeing any pushback on getting these 32% effective price increases in this environment and to what is that in your internal growth guidance?
Brian McKeon: Its in our projections Ashwin I think fundamentally the way that we’re going about during is really very – that our customers recognize that it is a function of investments that we’ve made it really in our value proposition, we’ve been investing aggressively if you go back a few years we talked about the need to invest in security and how we are making those investments and that we wont go to realize value having full investments are in place. It wasn’t a competitive issue right, we were already more secure than in our competition in this market requirement. So we found it very much to the investment that were making we’re really not seeing any material push back because of the marked upon – is very slight majority in individual customer. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Okay guided and Bob you mentioned your presence in the healthcare segment in your prepared remarks as this may be too early to do this, but it might still be what – your could either size or qualitatively address the potential impact of healthcare record conversation specifically with the larger. I want to laid out in the Obama.
Brian McKeon: Well there is a great opportunity there again we have – to business in the last couple of year now have a dedicated focussed, this tremendous amount of opportunity, we have a strategy and placed ago after that we’ll relatively small compared to the market opportunity and as we go forward quarter-in-quarter, we described how we’re advancing that strategy, but there is a lot of business to be had there over the medium plant.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup: Okay thank you more to come I guess very good quarter. Thank you guys.  
Brian McKeon: Thanks Ashwin.
Ashwin Shirvaikar – Citigroup:  Thank you.
Operator:
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Hi thanks a lot. Just back on the 20 or 21 million for facilitating the capital leases, I just want to make sure that’s baked into the ’09 the EBITDA guidance and therefore if we wanted to be -- on an accounting basis with ’08. We’re just lot 20 million of the guidance range right.
Brian McKeon: That is accurate as – 8 to 13% growth include in our 3 point – change.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: We won’t have a change, we won’t have million packed on net income or EPS because we have offset and depreciation and interest lines. Got it and sort of bigger picture question on the cross selling progress can you give us a few for how many cost of merge maybe on a percentage basis or taking multiple services how many you are just taking in a one core service and so far. Thanks. 
Brian McKeon: We continue to make that steady progress on that advance as that the I don’t have that state to breakout for this one with may lot of progress in cross selling in our customers. I will tell you that – that relative to our past we’ve improve relative to our potential at see a tremendous opportunity and improving or go to market effectiveness. Again over a long period of time.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Okay, great and you mentioned differing some data center CapEx into ’09, when you look forward based on what’s you are planned we accomplish in ’09 with that be the bulk of what’s to plan to expensive within next two to three years in that regard or with the ’09 data center CapEx bigger run rate for 2010, 2011 so far.
Brian McKeon: Yeah, I think it’s a where the ladder we’re going to be continuing is growth capital support additional business and I think we are tried to highlight some of the more discrete items that are impact in the ’09 number which are the advancement in rationalizing our – real estate and the incremental investment in the growth opportunities, which is around complaint federal records but I think our underlying growth rate we’re very pleased with the progress and making an improving efficiency and I will look at system are going forward.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Okay, that helps. Thanks.
Brian McKeon: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Wirth with Robert W. Baird.
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird: Good morning.
Brian McKeon: Good morning.
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird: When you could address a little bit what’s you are seeing with your customers in the financial sector and a last analyst say, you have talk about how you actually thought about turmoil in the financial sector would actually could actually being that positive for you could you talk about those customers still growing in lined with your core business are they lagging are they actually growing a little bit faster?
Brian McKeon:  Our storage remains very solid we are seeing pressure Andrea on discretionary projects – there are some deferrals as it relates to imaging projects and new endeavors by in terms of our underlying business it remains very solid I do believe will be an net beneficiary overtime simply because regulations will prove – risk has to reduced cost has to reduced that is our value proposition. But right now its fairly distractive sector the good news is our the core business 
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird:  And then just a quick question on fuel could you remind us what fuel is as a percent of your cost and then when you look at it – mentioned commodity cost in total of how about at 2% impact I am assume the vast majority of that’s paper but could your break that down between paper and fuel.
Brian McKeon: All right our energy cost as we talk in the past year about 3% of revenues that half of that is related to transportation and half of that’s relates to utilities and our facilities you are correct when we talked about commodity pricing we realized a benefit of this year probably a little sales of 1% of our overall revenue from higher fuel surcharges that’s changed quite a bit and as we look forward we are anticipating lower fuel surcharges next year so that 2% impact number the combination of paper on lower fuel pricing I just want to fuel surcharge pricing do want to highlight that the net impact of changes in energy cost are somewhat neutral for our business in that the fuel surcharges are intend to offset change in transportation energy cost so we net don’t see a significant impact on that front and we would anticipate in some benefits on hopefully in the utility side over the time that will support our gross margin outlook further. The profit impact from fuel changes is somewhat significant for us.
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird: Just one final question just what was the overall pricing contribution to revenue this quarter. 
Robert Brennan: We don’t break that out for a company what I would say is overall because obviously saw a variety of different price product and services globally. We have highlighted in the past the trends on our records management storage pricing and as we finished this year on o year-over-year basis our run rate is we are up about 3% year-on-year which is where we were hoping to get to we think that's a good level and that is incorporated into the break out look that we have for next year. And we feel very good about our ability to sustain that kind of value proposition.
Andrea Wirth – Robert W. Baird:  Thank you a nice quarter.
Robert Brennan: Thank you.
Operator: You next question comes from the line of Kevin Mcveigh with Credit Suisse.
Kevin Mcveigh – Credit Suisse:  Great thanks. 
Robert Brennan: Hi, Kevin.
Kevin Mcveigh – Credit Suisse: Hey, how are you? Real nice job. Given the headwind against commodity cost in the fourth quarter you saw real nice margin expansion overall could you kind of just help us understand what's the most incremental draw before?
Brian McKeon: In couple of different factors and the gross margin line Bob talked about this in his comments but we are really driving net driving excellent this year in North American business on a number of fronts we just spoke to some enhancements to our pricing trends productivity initiatives I hope to improve storage margins, the efforts we are putting against transportation improvement or helping with our labor efficiencies and on the gross margin line also all contributors and as the highlighted earlier in the year, we’ve going to our overhang cost early in there are really driven acquisition integration more than anything as well as investments we initiated late in 2007, what we have been executing very discipline approaching as our investments and cost management this year and we saw the benefit that in Q4, with the moderate in growth rate, so safety we’ve drive in business – hard. This business has a lot of potential and we’ve been using this share to get very focused on organic execution and its paying off and we will going to build on that is we are going forward.
Kevin Mcveigh – Credit Suisse :  Great and then the CapEx shift from the incremental data center moves how much was add in ’08 into ’09.
Brian McKeon: It’s a roughly $10 million.
Robert Brennan: Okay, we just want to highlight we obviously at – came into the March number that we are report casting few months ago and this want to highlight that is one of the factors going that improvement.
Kevin Mcveigh – Credit Suisse : Great thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan.
Andrew Steinerman – JP Morgan:  Hello, gentlemen. I want to talk about the margin expansion that’s implied in 2009 by clipping your revenue growth by 2 point in keep EBITDA growth at 18% to 30% obviously you are catch on some margin expansion here, could you talk about do you think you are seeing more in the gross margin line SG&A leverage what did you confidence in the ability to product margin expansion here. 
Brian McKeon: Yeah, and Andrew, just want to build on in earlier question from events keep in mind that about three points on the gain as related to the that vehicle lease change, if you peal that are out of our internal growth is 5 to 7, we’re employed constant dollar at the growth is 5 to 10 so its moderate margin improvement, we have couple of different dynamics going on. We expect to sustain solid gross margin as we work into next year there will be some impact obviously related to the changes in recycle paper pricing that sets something we can address overtime but in this short-term that’s the high margin revenue that will decline and so that is offsetting that a bit and so that we are looking to sustain our gross margins and we think that will the source of our margin improvement as we move forward on the SG&A [prompt] we are looking to sustain our revenue roughly in lined with our cost growth roughly in lined with our revenue growth and the higher balanced approach there and I think there was a key point Bob was forcing in his comments is that were driving efficiencies but we are also looking to invest in the future businesses well and you got in the balance later.
Robert Brennan: And the strategy is the same strategy Andrew that will in place for you are trying I mean we are repetitive with focussing on growth returns and our three phases but it – dividends when you stayed focussed on that same strategy for long time.
Brian McKeon: And we feel pretty good about our – put forth numbers that imply a profit add are above the rate of revenue despite some of these [Christopher] highlighting the – recycle paper we are very committed to improve the underlying returns in business. 
Andrew Steinerman – JP Morgan:  Right did you have change anything over the last couple of months to achieve that particularly I am talking about the gross margin line or is this what you had been planning ever since kind of late 2008.
Brian McKeon: I would say it reflects plans that we’ve had in place since 2007 that we we’ve – against we’ve been last few month clearly like any company we’ve been revisiting our investment plans to make sure that we are lined with our growth outlook and we are getting tighter about that but I think we’re…
Robert Brennan:  We already had this upon in our operating rhythm, but we become more and more and more discipline in light of the conditions that we see in the pressure on the complementary revenue sure.
Andrew Steinerman – JP Morgan: That’s very responsible. Thank you so much.
Brian McKeon: Thanks Andrew.
Andrew Steinerman – JP Morgan: Welcome.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Edward Atorino with Benchmark. 
Edward Atorino – Benchmark: Talked about your acquisition thoughts – down and not really looking – lot of stuff if we do not make acquisitions would free cash flow go up even with the little jump in CapEx and is that CapEx number – as it looks like did like last year. 
Brian McKeon:  Yes I am afraid one of use of – down is really describing our customer is related to new purchases where no way hunger down, I want to impress upon the listeners that we’re very aggressive in intend on expanding our business and our growth – that will include some acquisitions especially as we see some shakeout environment where we expect prices to become cheaper. We do not expect, we opposed the acquisitions today is in our core North American business in our core business in general, most of all, we do internationally is true joint ventures and that really we just focussed on where there’re opportunities – add to our platform from DMS prospective in a digital prospective. We don’t still the need to move right now, we think the market coming to us. We will be careful about watching our targets and to look at our past from a DMS or from a digital prospective. We generally have existing partnership with people that we are look expander deepened our partnership so we generally telegraphed these things.
Edward Atorino – Benchmark: You have Stratify, which is sort of one note play in the eDiscovery business is that an area that's right to be and we rolled up in the sense but sort of expand I guess in that position we will expand laterally I suppose in the eDiscovery business?
Brian McKeon: I think you are right at there are opportunities laterally we do see what we with Stratify is eDiscovery services as a platform radar and that's why its gotten the attention of PriceWaterHouseCoopers and Navigant. But you are correct I think that there is lateral expansion opportunities but some of that is organic right we have a tremendous amount of intellectual property in that business so some of our expansion that will have in organically but we expect to shake out in that business further it's a smaller fragmented market.
Edward Atorino – Benchmark: Yes.
Brian McKeon: And, I would expect prices to run away on us. Anything that will come to us.
Edward Atorino – Benchmark: And on the CapEx question.
Brian McKeon: I am sorry.
Edward Atorino – Benchmark: In CapEx it's looks a jumping up in '09 over '08 is it kind to go back to the 13% of revenues or is it likely the sort of trend down going forward.
Brian McKeon: Well I think I will step back and say that '09 and midpoint of our guidance is basically 12.5%
Edward Atorino – Benchmark: Okay
Brian McKeon: CapEx excluding real estate is a percentage of sales, which is….
Edward Atorino – Benchmark: Lower yeah.
Brian McKeon: We actually exceeded our targets in driving capital efficiency in '08 and so I would there are some increase that are desecrate to kind of growth in rationalization we are making but we combined we are $110 million to lower to combine '08 and '09 capital we shared in the investor day so we are driving lot of capital efficiency right now.
Edward Atorino – Benchmark: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. You last question comes from the line of Franco Turrinelli with William Blair and company.
Franco Turrinelli – William Blair: Can you hear me?
Brian McKeon: Franco.
Robert Brennan: Hi, Franco.
Franco Turrinelli – William Blair: Although when I going to back to one observation which is in the North American, not makes the businesses performing its seems exceptionally well, but it seem like we’ve so being talking about Europe on international business can you set for some time and I guess I would like to go back over some of things your do a specially to improve the performance to the international business in when we’ve might see some improvement back.
Brian McKeon: Sure, so it does take time we haven’t talking about some time just you give us some perspective on it we’ve essentially upgraded the entire management team across a European business in the last two years putting infrastructure related to reporting systems as well as just some of the productivity initiatives that – we’ve actually been doing for years in North America and we are seeing in the gains from that we’ve been putting I mean in place over the last couple years. And because its really three different groups of businesses, right you’ve got joint venture partners you’ve got small acquisitions in countries we were still subscale, when you’ve got the large businesses in Australia an UK and so we think about in three different [crosstrees]. And how we manage those, I feel very good that that were positioned in UK and Australia, you will start to see the return improvements it takes longer with our joint ventures and out smaller country positions just you guesses the scale issues but, we do have a long view on this front and we believe that we can peruse North American life return over time but it is the – that is taking a little longer than – then we thought of two years ago, but I absolutely confident that we got there. 
Franco Turrinelli – William Blair: Just on goal, it is an fundamental differences that we should be aware of – growth backwards from exciting customers which is although see big part of the U.S. business is growth or pricing or rather things that we should understand from growth point of view.
Brian McKeon: From a pricing perspective I think some of the dynamics of the same that we have significant competitive advantage, and where we have both that presence in this large market by U.K. and Australia we have that competitive advantage, it doesn’t exist to the same extend where we have very small presence. The other opportunity that exist internationally is that there – but for a helping customers with what inside the box which is have a describe our document management solutions business this will be a bigger part of our growth going forward and we feel that that it is very much build are be in the – information and that there is the our value proposition resin it on worldwide basis.
Robert Brennan: Its part in do way a very small presence.
Brian McKeon: So, scaling those areas is critical to us. In general I think you can see as peruse over time, the kind of returns that you are start to see in the North America.
Franco Turrinelli – William Blair: Thanks Bob.
Robert Brennan: Thanks Franco. Well, thank you all for your time and attention today we’re started to ran a few minutes over I may hope you have good rest of today.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Iron Mountain’s fourth quarter 2009 earnings webcast. You may now disconnect.

===== 2008 Q3  (2008-10-30 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Stephen P. Golden - VP, IR Bob Brennan - President and CEO Brian P. McKeon - EVP and CFO
Analysts: Kevin Mcveigh - Credit Suisse Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch Franco Turrinelli - William Blair David Gold - Sidoti & Company John Healey - FTN Midwest
Operator: Good morning. My name is Kelly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Incorporated Q3 2008 Earnings Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Golden, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Stephen P. Golden - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, and welcome everyone to our 2008 third quarter earnings conference call. After my announcement this morning, Bob Brennan will give his state of the company remarks, followed by Brian McKeon who will deliver the financial review. When Brian is finished, we'll open up the phones for your questions and provide the answers. First, a quick word on the new starting time for our quarterly earnings conference calls. We believe a full discussion of our results, sooner rather than later and closer to the timing of our press release enhances our overall disclosure, especially given the current state of the capital markets. We appreciate the importance of timely distribution of information and we hope you find this helpful. As a note, 8:30 will be our standard start time going forward. Next, I'd like to thank everyone who joined us for our annual Investor Day events earlier this month. It's an event we look forward to every year, and hope you found the presentations both interesting and informative. As always, we appreciate your continued support. For our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.imountain.com. Referring now to slide two, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2008 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release or the Safe Harbor language on this slide, for discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, operating income before D&A or OIBDA and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments are metrics we speak too frequently, and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures for the appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. With that, I would like to introduce Bob Brennan, our President in CEO.
Bob Brennan - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Stephen. Good morning everyone and thank you for taking the time to join us for our Q3 earnings call. Messages... the purpose of our call today is to let you know that we are pleased with our performance. We are as expected feeling the pressures associated with this environment, but we believe that they are very manageable. And that we in turn can hit the targets that we've set for ourselves. As Stephen said, it was great seeing you all at Investor Day on October 8th. We thought it was a good day and appreciate those of you that chose to attend, whether in person or via the web. We always appreciate the opportunity to meet with you, highlight the health of our business as well as speak to our outlook. Since we just spoke to many of you on Investor Day about our strategy in detail, today we're going to go through our Q3 results, and provide a very brief update on areas of progress and advancing the strategic agenda that we set out for you on Investor Day. The big issue that's developed for us in the past few weeks has been the swings in the currency market, and its effect on our reported results, which we will explain in deeper detail. Before we begin, I would like to take a moment to reinforce some of the key themes that we shared with you at Investor Day. The first point is that Iron Mountain continues to perform well. We achieved solid 8% internal growth again in Q3, and remain on track to sustain targeted 79% internal growth this year, and again next year in 2009. And while we're performing well across all our segments, I want to point out that our North American performance in particular is doing quite well where we continue to drive strong revenue and profit gains benefiting from improved execution and customer service. The team in North America is doing a great job in driving standardization and uniformity in our business, while increasing customer satisfaction. We're very pleased with their performance. The second point that we made at Investor Day and that I want to reiterate here, is that we're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. Our team has made great progress in strengthening our balance sheet under the leadership of our treasury team and the strength of our business model. We're taking a conservative approach on this front in the current environment. We currently have over $300 million in cash and nearly $400 million in additional debt capacity under a well diversified senior credit facility. Again, I want you to know that we're being conservative. As you know, we have no meaningful debt maturities until 2012, and we're well positioned to fund our business over the near, medium, and long-term. Most important point that Brian and I wanted to get across at Investor Day is that we're committed to delivering strong financial performance through a disciplined approach to management execution. We continued to drive solid gains in gross margins in part because we are focused on capturing the value that we have created for our services through pricing excellence. We stay close to the customer, the pipeline and our services in this timeframe as a relationship based services business, we have a daily polls on our customers' behavior, and we're being particularly careful to stay highly visible, with both of our employees and our customers as well as you. We are exercising cost and capital spending discipline, which is supporting outlook for strong profit gains and significantly improved capital efficiency this year. And we expect to sustain this progress going into 2009 and forward throughout 2009. And as we highlighted at Investor Day, our goals are to drive constant dollar revenue gains of 7% to 9% and 8% to 13% OIBDA growth in 2009, without assuming any benefits from acquisitions. So the bottom line is I am pleased with our performance and our outlook. And I believe we're well positioned to sustain this performance moving forward, because we do have a resilience business model. I do, however, expect impacts from a soft economy, particularly on discretionary costumer spending. And now how on behaving as it relates to discretionary spending and that which is discretionary, we're being very, very disciplined and careful about. There is an element of our business that's discretionary in our costumers' eyes and we have to manage that carefully. But the majority of our business flows from our predictable, recurring storage foundation, so those impacts around discretionary spending are quite manageable. This foundation reinforces our confidence and our commitment to deliver continued strong financial performance. So, as I'm pleased with our performance, we sill have this FX issue. And our results can and in fact are being impacted in the near term by significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As you all know, the U.S. dollar has appreciated dramatically in recent months, with key currencies like the pound, the euro, the Australian and Canadian dollars having loss between 20% and 30% of their value, with accelerated declines just over the past few weeks. Because our enterprise results are reported in U.S. dollars, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can have a meaningful impact on our reported results, particularly when they change this quickly. In Q3, significant swings in FX rates required us to record large non-cash charges in deferred tax provisions, which in turn lowered our earnings per share. We're also updating our Q4 financial outlook to reflect an anticipated 5% reduction in revenue and OIBDA growth related to recent FX volatility. Brian will take you through a detailed review of these developments in just a few minute. But I want you to know that FX is not a reflection of the health of our business at Iron Mountain. Our underlying operating performance is solid and we fully expect strong performance going forward. Our businesses here in the U.S. and around the world continue to perform well, this is evidenced in our Q3 operating results. We continued this target strong internal revenue growth which is foreign exchange neutral. And as Brian will cover the true economic impacts from foreign exchange volatility to Iron Mountain are also mitigated by some key factors. First, as a service company our cost are in local currency, so we don't face exporter type risks. We've matched our long-term assets and liabilities to our global treasury program and we are not repatriating international funds, but rather investing to grow the international business, using local currency cash flow and cash flows and financing. So, we don't rely on bringing cash from overseas to fund our business. As you know, we have a strong business model. While factors such as foreign exchange may fluctuate over time, the strength of the Iron Mountain model is sustained, as is our commitment to driving towards the great potential we see for our business. Remember, this potential is driven by the exponential growth in information, and the regulation and complexity that comes with that growth. We're the leaders in protecting and storing information and that business model remains very strong. So the business is good, the FX fluctuations have been surprising but there are no surprises in the business itself. And as we said on Investor Day, nothing changes quickly in the underlying business. So, let's turn to reviewing the highlights from our third quarter business performance. Q3 was another solid quarter for Iron Mountain as we delivered strong overall revenue and comfortable OIBDA growth of 12% and 14% respectively. Both numbers exceeded the top end of our forecasted ranges. We saw strong growth and performance across all business segments. North America did exceptionally well, internal storage growth remained solid at 8%. We also delivered overall internal revenue growth of 8% for the quarter as strong core service growth offset expected pressures on some of our complementary service revenue streams. So, let's go through each of the reporting segment. As I mentioned before, North American Physical segment is doing great, supported by strong execution from the team. We are seeing benefits of strong service revenue growth, 13% internal growth gains on this front. We continued to drive solid growth in our North American Shredding Business, and this business is built on investments that we've already made, that really quite frankly can't be matched by our competition, as that business, evolves we build that we're very well positioned. We're also seeing benefits from our focus on capturing higher value for our services through pricing. As I have described on Investor Day, we have already invested in having much better facilities, much better chain of custody, stronger systems, and we think the best work force in our industry, and we believe that we can realize value for that on a sustainable basis. We continued to drive solid profit gains in North America where storage margin is strengthening, as we increased utilization of our physical network of our buildings and vehicles, and we're becoming increasingly smarter about how we manage workflow. We're seeing steady benefits from several productivity initiatives in North America, and I am very pleased with the performance of the team. They really are humming and we intend to... we really expect their capability to continue to improve and its capability that we can export to our international businesses. We're focused on building on the progress that's been made in the North America as we head into 2009. This is the foundation of our business and it's the foundation for delivering against our financial objectives over this short, medium, and long-term. Now let's turn to International. Our International segment also reported solid results this quarter. As I mentioned at Investor Day, with consolidated leadership of our International segment under Marc Duale, formally the President of Iron Mountain Europe. Marc joined us two and a half years ago and as a strong international business executive with extensive experience. This will allow us to take a very balanced approach to managing our investments across the entire portfolio of international businesses. And I expect that Marc and his team will drive improved organizational capability around the globe and drive offering leverage through the infrastructure that's been built, particularly in Europe. Our core revenue growth in international was strong for the quarter, supported by consistent store revenue gains. Complementary service revenues came under pressure, as we expected, with the completion of the second larger European special project, we have been discussing with you for the last two quarters. So, let's talk about Iron Mountain Digital. Digital posted another solid quarter, supported by continued benefits from growth in new services. As you know, we're the leader in storage asset service, having built up strong market positions in distributed data protection and having formed strong partnerships recently with Hewlett-Packard, IBM and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Our Stratify acquisition in the space that Stratify occupies that we discovered remains quite exciting for us. We continued to exceed our expectations and drive our leadership in this field. We continue to expect our digital services to be a strong growth driver in a sustained long-term way for Iron Mountain and are pleased with their performance in Q3. So, on balance; we had a very good Q3 with solid underlying performance across all of our major segments, North American Physical, International Physical and Iron Mountain Digital. Let's talk about the market just a little bit. In terms of the overall market environment, as expected, we are seeing impacts from a slowing economy on more discretionary revenue areas. Complementary service activity has slowed particularly with respect to more discretionary areas such as fulfillment services and software license revenue. One is a marketing service essentially and the other is a deferral expense. We expect to continue... to see continued pressure on complementary revenues, which represented about 15% of our overall revenues as we move forward. This part of our business does in fact fluctuate, and will continue to fluctuate but we believe it's manageable. I spent a lot of time with our customers and a lot of time on the road. And they are facing a tremendous amount of pressure. It's particularly acute for those in the financial services sector which represents approximately 20% of our revenue. But we're able to help them with that pressure. Where we see them moving is, there is a long-term project that brings long-term benefits they are tending to defer on that. What we're able to help them with though, is we can offer in most cases a short-term benefit with some short-term activity that drives out their cost, drives down their complexity and drives their compliance. Right now, they are most interested in cost. But we're able to help them with that. So, we feel that we can manage the pressure that they are facing, as well as move to more of a short-term cost focus with our customers on special projects. So, I think it's important to remember that our services are particularly important regardless of economic conditions. We've had solid business across our businesses, largely because what we provide is critical. Our customers remain very much focused regardless of their economic condition on reducing cost and reducing risk. And as you might expect, we're seeing increased interest in certain areas such as litigation support, and we... and compliant records management. Information have to be captured and protected as well as disposed off regardless of what's going on externally. If anything, regulation sensitivity is expected to increase in this time. So, in other words, we remained very empathetic with our customers. We worked with them day-in and day-out because we're service business we... it's not like we come in and out of our relationship with them. So, we understand their pressures as they go through them. We have great relationships with them. And we're focused on solving their problems. In other words, the market conditions remain strong for the short, medium, and long-term. We have a very large and expanding market where we are the leader. So, the business is performing well. Our customers are in fact under pressure. We feel that we can manage that pressure and the market conditions remain good. So we... the key for us here is to take a very disciplined focus in this environment. While we maintain a high standard of responsiveness to our customers and that yields incremental growth opportunity, we're also very careful to operate with a high level of discipline around cost and capital management to ensure that we deliver against our targets. It's also very important that culturally you understand how we think of this time. It's a time for a very visible leadership. And so we are spending an awful lot of time with our customers and our employees to let them know that Iron Mountain is solid business, where we can help solve their problems, that we're a very reliable employer, we're a very reliable service provider. And it's just very important that we're highly visible. We're trying to do the same with you. But we are also... but we're being very disciplined. So, let me talk about acquisitions in organic versus inorganic growth, because acquisitions have been key to our strategy and we expect them to play a part in our strategy going forward. But I want to highlight that our focus is on executing against inorganic growth opportunity right now. We've seen great benefits in this front this year, as reflected in the our strong performance for North America. And as attractive opportunities will present themselves in this timeframe, but we want to assure you that our operating discipline extends to our acquisition strategy as well. We believe in holding a conservative approach on this front in this environment. We see opportunities to drive organic growth and we will maintain this focus in the future. So to sum up my remarks, I'm pleased with our results this quarter and so far this year our business is performing well and it's on track. We will experience some impacts in the near term from large punctuations and factors such as exchange rates. But our operating performance and our outlook remains solid. And with it, we assure you that we continue to maintain a very disciplined approach as a management team. And, I believe we're well positioned to build on the progress that we've made to-date with what is the large in expanding market opportunity for our services. So, thank you again for joining us this morning. And at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian for our financial review.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Bob, and good morning everyone. Q3 was another solid quarter for Iron Mountain as we posted strong revenue growth and OIBDA gains ahead of our forecast, supported by 8% internal growth. These results reflect solid operating performance across our business units. As usual today, we'll review our quarterly results and provide an update on our year-to-date cash flow performance, capital spending trends, and our debt position. Given, unusual recent changes in foreign exchange rates, we'll also spend time today discussing the impacts of foreign exchange on our reported results. Significant fluctuations in FX rates during the third quarter required recognitions of large non-cash charges and deferred tax provisions, which lowered our reported of EPS by about $0.17 per share. The record strengthening of the U.S. dollar in recent weeks is also requiring us to make adjustments to our 2008 full year guidance. As projected, FX impacts in the fourth quarter were more than offset operating upsides in the business. As we discussed at Investor Day, fluctuations and factors such as currency rates can impact our reported results. These factors however don't alter the fundamental soundness of our business, which is performing well and is on track. Let's now turn to slide four to review the key messages from today's review. The primary message that you should hear in today's review is that our operations are performing well. Iron Mountain delivered strong financial results in Q3 with revenue growing 12% and OIBDA growing 14% on a comparable basis, excluding asset gains and losses. We continued to drive solid business performance in a challenging economic environment. This reflects the strength of our business model as well as benefits from a disciplined management approach. We posted strong revenue gains across all major business units, supported by 8% internal growth, the benefits of our major acquisitions, and favorable year-over-year foreign currency movements. OIBDA growth was supported by solid gains in gross profit and moderated cost growth, which supported an increase in comparable OIBDA margins. We've maintained an excellent liquidity position, following the successful completion of the refinancing transaction, including the sale of $300 million of 8% bonds due to 2020 and the redemption of $72 million of 8.25% percent bonds due 2011 earlier this summer. We currently have over $300 million in cash and about $400 million of availability under our revolving credit facility, which is well diversified. As we look forward, our operating outlook remains strong. We're on track to deliver 2008 performance consistent with our original 2008 goals of 7% to 9% internal growth, 10% to 13% revenue growth and 10% to 14% OIBDA growth. As we announced at Investor Day, we expect to build on this performance in 2009 with plans for continued strong 7% to 9% internal growth next year. As noted, the unusual strengthening of the U.S. dollar in recent weeks is having impact on our reported results. We'll spend sometime isolating the impact of these changes on our Q3 results and on our reported growth outlook in Q4 in 2009. We'll also try to put these near term fluctuations in currency in a broader economic context for Iron Mountain. Now, let's move onto looking at the details of our performance on slide five. Slide five, compares results for this quarter to Q3 of 2007. Overall, we had another strong revenue quarter, supported by growth across our key business segments, which drove an overall revenue increase of 12%. Our largest segment North American Physical posted internal revenue growth of nearly 10%. We saw solid growth across our records management, data protection and secure shredding product lines. Overall growth was supported by solid storage gains and strengthening core service revenues. These gains are offset anticipated so often as a more discretionary areas such as fulfillment services. Our international business was up 11% overall. Internal growth was 4%, supported by continued strength in our Latin American business. As expected, we saw declines in complementary service revenues in Europe as the second major project we've been speaking was... about was concluded in the third quarter. These declines reduced international revenues by about $8 million or about 5% in Q3. Offsetting these impacts, international growth benefited from select acquisitions that are strengthening our global footprint and for favorable year-over-year foreign exchanges which together added 7% to revenue gains. Our Digital segment also drove strong revenue growth with 44% gains overall, supported by 10% internal growth and continued strong performance from Stratify. We saw solid growth in storage revenues and as expected some weakness in more discretionary purchase areas, such as software license sales. Revenue gains helped to drive a solid 14% year-on-year improvement in gross profit. Gross margins were up for the quarter, compared to the same prior year period, supported by strong storage margins, growth and high margin services as well as benefits from the sale of the low margin data product sales business and sustain higher recycle paper pricing. Year-on-year SG&A growth moderated to 14% in the quarter, slightly above the rate of revenue growth. As noted, higher rates of overhead growth this year have been driven by the integration of recent technology acquisitions and carryover impacts from investments in security, international sales resources and infrastructure initiated in 2007. We expect SG&A growth to continue to moderate in the fourth quarter. OIBDA, which grew 10% on a reported basis to $211 million in Q3, 2008, included $2 million of asset write-offs related to building moves in North America. Included in our Q4 guidance is $2 million of write-offs associated with additional building moves. Note that 2007, Q3 results included a $5 million net gain on asset dispositions. On a comparable basis, excluding asset gains and losses, OIBDA grew 14% in Q3, 2008 compared to Q3, 2007. Depreciation was $65 million and amortization was $10 million for the quarter. The increase in amortization was driven primarily by technology acquisitions completed in the second half of 2007. Operating income was $136 million for Q3, 2008 at 6% versus the prior year as operating gains were partially offset by the assets write-offs and increased depreciation and amortization, driven by 2007 capital spending and acquisitions. Slide six breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions in foreign exchange, which added about 2% and 1% respectively to our growth rates for the third quarter. Internal revenue growth for the quarter was 8%, within the range established for our full year growth calls. As a reminder, we removed the 2007 and 2008 revenues associated with the divested product sales business from our internal growth calculations. Internal growth was comprised of 8% storage growth and 9% service growth, reflecting continued benefit from expansion of less capital intensive services. Core service internal growth improved to 13% in Q3, supported by strong performance in North America, including benefits from higher fuel surcharges and strength in pricing. The internal growth rate for complementary services moderated in Q3 as expected. Gains and recycle paper revenues were offset by reduced special project activity. As noted earlier, the completion of two major European public sector service contracts over the last year resulted in an $8 million reduction in revenues. This cause an 8% negative impact to Q3 complementary service growth. We've also seen lower growth in areas such as fulfillment services and software license sales, which are areas more likely to be impacted by economic conditions. Complementary service revenue which represents nearly 15% of overall revenues can vary overtime. Given fluctuations and demand and timing for special project activity, and variation of factors, such as recycle paper pricing. Despite these impacts, our overall internal growth rates have remained solid through the year and we're on track to deliver against our full year internal growth goals. Moving on with our review of our Q3 P&L performance, slide seven bridges our Q3 operating income to net income and EPS results. Q3 results on these fronts were basically as expected excluding impacts from the records strengthening of the U.S. dollar which pressured our reported net income and EPS. As discussed, operating income for the quarter was up 6% to $136 million as operating gains were partially offset by year-on-year impacts from asset write-offs and increases in depreciation and amortization. Our Q3 interest expense was $59 million as expected and inline with Q2. We now expect interest for the full year to be approximately $240 million. Net income for the quarter of $11 million or $0.06 per diluted share was impacted by the record strengthening of the U.S. dollar since the end of the second quarter of 2008. The impacts to other expense in our effective tax rate from FX, from changes in FX rates reduced reported EPS by approximately $0.17 per share in Q3. We'll talk about this in more depth later in our presentation. But rapid changes in foreign currencies during the quarter can result in meaningful accounting impacts as we mark our debt to market and adjust estimated deferred tax effects for these changes. Large declines in foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar during the quarter drove a net $16 million non-cash charge in other expense. The net $16 million expense is comprised of offsetting foreign currency gains the losses which are incurred in different tax jurisdictions. As a result we recorded in additional $20 million non-cash tax provision. The impact of these two charges rates are effective tax rate to 81.6% for the quarter. Please note that these effects do not affect cash flow and are non-recurring in nature as they relate to changes in foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Our effective tax rate before the impact of any foreign currency rate fluctuations and other discrete items for the third quarter was approximately 40%, up from the estimated 38% rate due to a reduction in our allowable interest deductions in certain foreign subsidiaries. We're estimating our tax rate before discrete items for 2008 to be approximately 39%, up slightly due to this impact. After 2008, we expect our tax rate, excluding the impact of discrete items to decrease over time by approximately 2%. Based on the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar since September 30th, we expect some more dynamics to be in play for the fourth quarter, with likely recognition of non-cash charges to other expense and increases in our reported effective tax rate. At this point, we can't predict the year-end exchange rates in order to measure the size of the impact, but want to reinforce that it will be a non-cash non-recurring effect. Turning to slide eight, let's look at our year-to-date performance. You can see that Q3 operating results build on the solid performance we posted in the first half of 2008. Balance growth across are key businesses and service lines is supporting solid overall revenue in OIBDA gains and reinforcing our confidence that we're on track towards delivering against our strategic and financial goals this year. Net income for the first half of 2008 was $81million compared to $125 million for the same period in 2007. The key factors impacting the 2008 results or other expense, which was $13 million in 2008 versus other income of $2 million in 2007, in a significantly higher effective cash rate which was 54% versus 27% in 2007. Fluctuation in foreign exchange is the key driver of changes in both these factors. The impact of the foreign currency rate changes on other expense and effective taxes have resulted in a $0.16 reduction and fully diluted earnings per share in 2008. We'll shift now to reviewing drivers of our cash flow performance. Slide nine summarizes our capital spending for the year-to-date and our updated outlook for 2008 compared to 2007 full year results. We're maintaining our outlook for improved capital spending efficiency this year and revising our 2008 capital spending guidance downward to reflect recent foreign exchange rate changes. Our CapEx for the first nine months of 2008 was $239 million, including $19 million for real estate. Traditionally, the second half of the year is heavier with respect to CapEx spending as some projects are scheduled for later in the year and many required time to plan and source before the significant expenditures are eventually made. We expect to finish the year with approximately $430 million of CapEx spending. This is down slightly from our updated estimate provided at our Investor Day reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past few weeks. Let's now move on to slide 10 and look at free cash flow for the quarter. Slide 10 highlights our year-to-date cash flow performance compared to the same period in 2007. For the first nine months in 2008, free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $86 million. The year-on-year decrease in cash flow reflects the payment in Q1, 2008 of the unusually large 2007 year end CapEx accrual balance of $60 million, partially offset by higher operating cash flow. Keep in mind that free cash flow is best looked at on our full year basis as the timing of certain cash events is not consistent through the year. For example, the first quarter, historically our lowest cash flow quarter was impacted by the 2007 CapEx accrual, and the payment of annual bonuses. For 2008, we now expect free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to be approximately $50 million to $100 million. This is an increase from our last outlook, primarily driven by lower expected capital spending in 2008. As noted on our last call, 2008 free cash flow is impacted by the 2008 CapEx accrual I just spoke of being paid in Q1. Now, let's turn to slide 11 for a review of our current debt and liquidity position. In terms of our debt portfolio, we ended Q3, 2008 in a strong position. Our weighted average interest rate is 7.1% and we're 78% fixed. Consolidated leverage is now 4.1 times at the low-end of our target range of four to five times OIBDA and well within our 5.5 times covenant alignment. Maturity is now at 7.4 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2012. As Bob mentioned in his opening remarks, we have a very strong balance sheet, and we're well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. As noted, we successfully issued $300 million of 8% senior subordinated notes due 2020. We used the proceeds to pay down our senior credit facility. We also redeemed the remaining $72 million of outstanding $8 million in the quarter percent notes due in 2011 in a transaction that was completed in early July. As a result of these activities, our liquidity position remains strong. We currently have over $300 million in cash and nearly $400 million in addition of borrowing capacity. While we maintained a strong operating outlook, we anticipate maintaining a more conservative approach to cash management in the current environment. Before I turn to financial outlook, I'd like to spend a moment discussing foreign exchange as the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar will have an impact on our reported results. 5/12 starts this discussion with a higher level perspective on economic impacts from foreign exchange for Iron Mountain. Iron Mountain does business around the globe with about a third of our revenues are roughly $1 billion, coming from markets using non-U.S. dollar currencies. In this context, our reported P&L results, which are recorded in U.S. dollars can't be impacted by changes in FX rates. In terms of our underlying business and economics however, it's important to understand a few key factors. The first and most important factor is that our international business performance, which is conducted in local currency, is solid, and it's not impacted by FX changes. Year-to-date internal growth in our international business is up 8%, despite anticipated pressures from the completion of a major public service contract in Europe. We continued to maintain a strong outlook for our international growth and financial performance. Secondly, two economic impacts to Iron Mountain in the near term from FX changes are mitigated by some key factors. As a service company, our costs are match with the revenues in local currencies, so we don't face the same type of currency exposure as an export of our products. Through our global treasury program we've also aligned our international assets and debts in the same currency. We also have international businesses that's funded with local currency cash flows and debt financing. That's supporting our plans for continued investment and business expansion. As such, we're not exposed to reliance and repatriation of funds from our international operations, which could be pressured by the near term appreciation of the U.S. dollar. While these factors mitigate the economic effect of FX volatility, our reported financial results can be impacted by significant short-term changes in rates. Let's turn to slide 12 to review how these changes are affecting our financial outlook. As Bob mentioned earlier, we've seen a historic strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies. This will have no effect on our internal growth rates. It will result, however, in a negative impact to our reported revenue growth until we work through these comparisons over the next four quarters. The chart on the left shows the change in four major currencies, the Australian and Canadian dollars, the British pound and the euro, throughout 2008, indexed to year-end 2007 rates. These currencies represent more than 83% of our foreign revenues and nearly 27% of our enterprise revenues in 2008. As you can see, these currencies are weakened between 20% and 30% since the end of the second quarter, with more than half of each decline coming since Investor Day earlier this month. These rapid changes have a couple of key impacts on our reported results. First, in terms of our revenues and OIBDA, which are reported in U.S. dollars, we need to lower forecast estimates to reflect current FX rates. As the table on the right indicates, we estimate that a reported revenue in OIBDA growth for Q4 will now be reduced 5 percentage points due to the FX changes, following positive impacts for the year-to-date. As noted earlier, we'll also likely see non-cash other expense charges and impacts on our Q4 effective tax rate, related to mark-to-market accounting, reflecting large FX changes already seen this month. As for 2009, while we're not updating our overall outlook at this time, at current rates FX would reduce 2009 revenue and OIBDA growth by about 6%. This compares to the 3% negative impact we estimated as part of our preliminary 2008 guidance at Investor Day. It's important to reinforce that FX movements don't impact the underlying fundamentals of our business. We maintain a solid outlook for our underlying operating performance, but we'll face some tougher comparisons in terms of our reported results in the near-term due to the record strengthening of the dollar. Let's now look at how this impacts our outlook for the balance of the year. Slide 14 represents a real foot of our full year outlook from the guidance we issued in our Q2 earnings call at the end of July to today's guidance. For illustration purposes, we're using the mid point of each outlook. As you can see, absent the impacts of the foreign currency rate changes and the $4 million of asset write-offs I spoke of earlier, our outlook for the second half of the year is actually improved. We're projecting net upside of $20 million in revenues and $7 million in OIBDA in our FX neutral operating performance versus our earlier midpoint guidance. Note that our Q4 outlook is somewhat below level as implied in our last forecast. This reflects timing of some project revenues which benefited Q3 results and adjustments to our Q4 outlook to reflect updated estimates in areas such as paper pricing and some expected charges related to our UK real estate rationalization program. Despite second half performance upsides however, we do need to lower our estimates per reported revenue in OIBDA to reflect a large recent changes in FX rates. Please turn now to slide 15, where we'll review our updated outlook for the balance of the year. Slide 15 summarizes our updated financial outlook incorporating net impacts from operating upsides offset by negative FX from foreign exchange. Our full year revenue outlook is now $3.35 billion to $3.65 billion, a growth of 11% to 12%. This outlook reflects consistent expectations for 7% and 9% internal growth this year. We're now targeting full year operating income of $473 to $488 million. This would imply an OIBDA range of $768 million to $783 million for the year or growth of 11% to 13% on a comparable basis excluding gains and losses and asset write-downs. We're reducing our full year CapEx forecast to approximately $430 million due primarily to the weakening of the British pound, sterling and the euro. At midpoint performance this would equate to a solid reduction in capital spending as a percent of sales in 2008, building on our 2007 progress. Our expectations for Q4 performance are shown here as well. Note that our guidance for Q4 is a little wider than usual, given recent volatility in factors such as FX. In summary, we had a solid quarter reflecting solid operating performance across our business. Our business is performing well. We remain on track to deliver against our financial calls and intend to build on this progress in 2009. Thanks and we'll now open the phones to take your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the Kevin Mcveigh with credit Suisse.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Kevin.
Kevin Mcveigh - Credit Suisse: Hey guys. Nice job on the quarter. Just one quick thing Bryan, at some point your not updating the '09 guidance at this point, is it fair to say there maybe some incremental positive impact that could offset the incremental 3.2 from the currency headwind versus a couple of weeks ago in the business?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We just didn't want to get into a formal update of guidance so quickly after I Day. We're maintaining our underlying operating outlook Kevin. Obviously, FX has moved quite a bit. We wanted to highlight that for you and we'll be refining our outlook in the coming weeks. But we're not changing our underlying outlook and we can't predict the FX right now. They could obviously move in a different direction and we'll... year end we'll give you an updated perspective on that front.
Kevin Mcveigh - Credit Suisse: Great. And then just a quick, the core services... real nice job on the 13% internal growth. Can you just break that down little bit kind of see where the strength was, and kind of what you're thinking into the fourth quarter as well?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: To our note, it was a strong quarter, it built on a strong quarter we had in Q2. Would you get some benefit from fuel surcharge increases. Just to revisit the fuel surcharges and our energy cost kind of move together, we... for our transportation related services. We see a benefit in revenue when our underlying transportation cost is going up and obviously that we have some offsets in higher costs. In terms of our revenue growth that added about 4% to the core service growth rate in Q3. So having said that we're still at a solid 9%. We would expect some mitigation in the fuel surcharge increase, just given that oil prices have come down, that will also see some lowering of our transportation cost, so those should net... and other than that I think we're maintaining solid core service growth.
Unidentified Company Representative: This kind of great job.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. The pressure on our business is more in the discretionary areas like complimentary services I noted that we are getting some benefits from higher pricing and we are strengthening our service margins in markets like the U.S. And we're continuing to see good activity in the storage and related service fund its the pressures that we've seen in the business or as expected more in the complimentary areas.
Kevin Mcveigh - Credit Suisse: Great. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Kevin.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan: Hi, there. My question is about the fourth quarter implied up margins compared to the third quarter. I heard in your prepared remarks, some comments about timing of projects third quarter versus fourth quarter, maybe you could jump in to that. And I just want to be very clear, and I think you're saying that FX does not affect margins fourth quarter versus third quarter.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes let me try to take that on. At mid-point, our outlook for Q4, Andrew I believe would be similar margins between Q3 and Q4 kind of in the 20, I'm sorry Q4 would be in the 26% range, and we have a similar kind of year-over-year improvement. I think we're trending sort of in the... if you take out some of the noise around the asset gains and losses, I think we're in the 50 to 100 basis point improvement. So we're pleased with that kind of progress and we implied in our outlook for 2009 is continued progress on that front. I just... the point on the timing of projects spent, when we did that role forward, I was just trying to highlight obviously, we had a bigger upsize in Q3 relative to our mid-point guidance. And I was just trying to help explain why you didn't see more flow through internally, like enhanced results, it just has to do with timing between Q3 and Q4, and as well as some other select thing that we book into the outlook.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan: Okay. And then FX coming. Does FX effect margins fourth quarter versus third quarter?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: From a margin point of view, it's obviously complicated, but the simple answer is FX changes don't really have an impact on margin, because obviously our revenues are impacted that our costs are also impacted as well. So, it's complicated, but the simple answer is that it's not a big margin impact. It does obviously impact the absolute reported levels for the enterprise.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan: All right. And last question, in your prepared remarks you talked about SG&A growth moderating in the fourth quarter, obviously I remember the higher spent a year ago. So, my question is, is this more anniversary SG&A year-over-year or is there some SG&A management in the fourth quarter, versus the third quarter of this year.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I'll let Bob talk about the cost discipline that we've been putting in place. There is some anniversary benefit as we pointed out, last year we had about $5 million of cost as we closed out the books, we do some final shootouts they'll kind of move to vendor action last year. So we will assuming everything is normal, this year we'll have some favorability. But more significant factor is that we've been quite disciplined in terms of our cost management
Bob Brennan - President and Chief Executive Officer: From a cultural perspective, Andrew being very careful on our own discretionary expense spending. And that in just in the past few weeks, I've got a couple of projects that I thought we put in place at this timeframe that we're ultimately benefit Iron Mountain, but in near terminal pretty comfortable staying in money and we are being very careful here and adding 00to over head especially in corporate function. We are not offering that production revenue, and our growth capacity in the field, but we have been very careful with all the head growth and we expect that to result in moderated growth in SG&A.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I want to point out one of the factor to you, Andrew, which is a lot of the growth that we saw year-to-date are the biggest driver of our SG&A growth being ahead of revenue growth in the first half of the year, was the integration of technology acquisition. And obviously, we've been disciplined on that front as well this year. We'd be working through those comparisons as fast as we in the fourth quarter and that's also a fact of contributing.
Andrew Steinerman - JP Morgan: Okay. That sounds good. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next questions comes from Michel Morin with Merrill Lynch
Unidentified Company Representative: Hi, Michel.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Good morning. I just wanted to double check something on your slide 14, where you rolled forward the guidance. It looks like very good performance in that 20% and $20 million upside to the top line generated, what is essentially a 35% margin. S, could you point out for us kind of where you think that upside has been coming from and why it's generated that much better profitability?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Obviously, a lot of puts and takes in that. I would say in simple terms, we are seeing some benefit from higher margin service growth. I think it's more of a mix of business impact but its complicated Michel. It's not a... there isn't anything underlying the kind of the performance of the business. It's... there is some things at the margins that helps to support that.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Alright, that's fair. And then could you explain for us a little bit how it is the FX related tax provisions are non-cash and maybe you talked about that in the prepared remarks and I may have missed it?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, well in the near term. It's a FX obviously fluctuates up and down and the tax provisions are related to as we mark our debt to market We have to reflect the changes that occur in high tax... relatively higher tax jurisdiction and lower tax jurisdictions. And, we recorded deferred tax division. So, our debt is six to 10 years out. So, if nothing changed between now and then, there could be a cash impact. But we've seen benefits... what we're seeing this quarter is actually a mirror of the benefits that we saw as the dollar was weakening as foreign currency is over the last couple of years. It just happened to occur all at once, so we had a big impact on the quarter. There could be a realization, but it's going to be tied to the maturation of the debt, which is long-term at six to 10 years.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Alright. And so this kind of impact is something that obviously could repeat itself in the fourth quarter and into '09 if we continue to see this kind of dollar strengthening?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, I do want to reinforce in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that we're going to have an impact. We're not quantifying it, but post September 30th, there is been a continued substantial appreciation of the dollar. And we don't have our year end rates yet, but if we... if these rates kind of sustain through the end of the year, we're likely going to see that in Q4. It all depends on what happens in the quarter Michel. So, 2009... this is basically which you try to true up, where your debt is at a point in time. So 2009, if the rates stayed where they were we wouldn't have this impacts. It's non-recurring in that sense. But Q4, as we said today, knowing how much the dollar is appreciated, we do anticipate sometime as an impact.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks very much.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is Ella for Scott. First just to follow on the previous discussion, can you just help us understand a bit more on the $60 million on cash charge for on the ForEx impact? I mean your EPS has never been so volatile before. So is it purely because of this ForEx fluctuation we see on the market, or is there any changes on your debt structure or like all your accounting policy? So, just help us to understand a bit more on this?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, it is entirely related to $16 million charges, entirely related to changes in FX during the quarter as we mark our debt to market. And, the reason that is significant in the quarter that there just been record changes in currencies, its unprecedented strengthening of the U.S. dollar. If you... as I mentioned in the response to the last question, we've actually seen benefits on this front going back over last couple of years. They just didn't occur all at once. They kind of burden over a period of time, so that... we expect to see some impact on other income and expense related to foreign currency changes. It is just unusual in this quarter. It has nothing to do with changes in the accounting perspective; it's just related to the FX when we saw.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And would you consider, since like hygiene, if your continuous to see such big volatile?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We do align our assets and our liabilities in international markets. We would have seen much more significant effect on something like other income expense if we didn't have that in place. And so we do leverage that. There is little we can do other than what we've already got in place which is a natural alignment of expenses and revenues in our business to impact the recorded revenue on the OIBDA FX from accounting point of view, we're not going to be hedge cash flows. And as you know, hedge is really on that front are just sort of a planning tool, just to lay kind of eventual changes in the tax rate. So, we're... we appreciate your patience as we work through some of this volatility. But the dynamics you're seeing are related to some unprecedented movements in currency
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks for that color...
Unidentified Company Representative: We have to move to the next question, we have a queue here, and we're running over so I'm going to ask we've actually moved to the next question.
Operator: Your next questions comes from Franco Turrinelli with William Blair
Franco Turrinelli - William Blair: Hi, Bob and Brian how are you? Bob, this is I think mainly for you, I mean, I'm so interested in thinking through, If we pack out at a couple of these long term impacts on internal growth, so lets back out the fuel surcharge as special projects. What we've got as a business that's basically generating 9% internal growth across every single aspect of the business. And in a sense, I'm sort of struggling to reconcile that with your comment, that you're assuming pressure in market. I mean this is an extremely impressive performance. And I guess what I'm asking here is; where is it really that you think you're seeing this weakness, because I don't think the results reflect much weakness or should we be thinking of the business now having a slight little growth that's significantly higher, in this high single-digit internal growth?
Bob Brennan - President and Chief Executive Officer: Franco, I think it's more we need to just trying to be very balanced in presenting our expectations; we have very high expectations for the performance. We're not seeing a lot of effect on the business. We do see the pressure our customers are on there. But the point I try to make is we think, we can manage through this and achieve the high expectations that were set for a year end for ourselves. The fact of the matter is, we believe that business is performing well; we can continue to manage strong performance and strong internal growth. But there is pressure on complementary revenue. We just have to meet that pressure by focusing on more short-term return on investment for our customers. And we can do that, but it requires tighter management. I didn't mean to set a lower expectations, we have very high expectations. But there is more pressure than there was just a quarter ago. We think we can respond to it, we think we can manage it and stay on target.
Franco Turrinelli - William Blair: It certainly looks like it. Thanks, Bob.
Bob Brennan - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Franco. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Gold with Sidoti.
David Gold - Sidoti & Company: Hi, good morning.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Bob Brennan - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, David.
David Gold - Sidoti & Company: Can you give a little more color on... your comments on the fourth quarter variance. You just alluded to not all of that presumably coming from currency. Can you talk about how much of it is coming from sort of other business factors and, just building on that?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, sure. Now that we try to highlight a few... and this was trying to relating it to what would have been implied in our last outlook. We obviously had a very good Q3. As we went up to add our Q4 outlook there were some... we had anticipate some projects that benefited Q3 result in North America, kind of recurring through to the back half of the year and they heard of it sooner. So we update our forecast for that. Papers moderated, it came down, it's now in the mid 180 range and so we are anticipate... that's actually are going to be a bit lower it was the year before. And so, we updated that outlook and we're also... we highlighted that at I Day David that we're doing the big real state rationalization program in the UK and as part of that we're going to be making some decisions around some buildings and we're going to have dilapidations charges that were going to have incur. So, I was just trying to highlight if you... anticipating a question as to why we're not seeing more flow through from the Q3 and we just had some factors that more on our Q4 outlook a bit.
David Gold - Sidoti & Company: Got you. Got you but just curious again... if maybe there's a better way to quantify sort of the difference. How much of it is currency and how much of it is business issue?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, we did try to isolate the currency impact for you. So what you are seeing in net, net is you have a non-currency number there.
David Gold - Sidoti & Company: Got you. Fair enough. Thank you.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks David.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Healey with FTN Midwest.
John Healey - FTN Midwest: Good morning, guys.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks John. We'll have to make this the last question everybody.
John Healey - FTN Midwest: Question... Just a big-picture question on your financial services customers. Obviously we're seeing some contraction in the number of players in this space. I'm not so much concerned about volumes but I was hoping to get your thoughts on pricing and how you see some of your, assuming your customers kind of combined with one another. What that does to the pricing of that business and if it's meaningful enough to have an impact on margins for you guys?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It will have an impact overtime. Generally with our financial services customers especially the largest ones we have long-term contracts, where to the extent that we have any flexibility that will be exercised over a very long period of time. This is actually an area where I'd spent a lot of time right now, John and the fact that they are under intense cost structure and we can help them by understanding what information that they are... does that some can be disposed of. How they can drive out some cost from the litigation that they're facing right now through our e-discoveries services. And, this is also when we do a lot of transactions day in and day out, we have a lot of people that face the customer on these accounts so that we're be in particularly visible and empathetic with them to really response to their needs to derive cost to equation. So, I hadn't to take to say that net, net it's more upside and downside, because... for obvious reasons relative to the state of the sector. But, definitely we're planning the business and that's how we're managing is that there that we are expecting to drive more upside than any downside factors that come from consolidation et cetera. So, we feel we can do a good job for our costumers there that we do, do a good job and they appreciate the help quite frankly.
John Healey - FTN Midwest: Okay, great. And there is just one follow-up question your thoughts on cash flow you talked about internally maybe a little bit more conservative on some of your expenditures any change in terms of higher organic deploying cash flow and then you maybe change in and have some pursuing acquisitions opportunities over there maybe the next 6 to 12 months or so.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We would be in really disciplined in this timeframe. But, we make sure that we understand our opportunities to expand internationally individually and we keep that landscape in mind but right now we're been particularly disciplined for reasons I'm sure you can understand.
John Healey - FTN Midwest: Great. Thank you, guys.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you all for joining us on the Q3 earnings call. We'll speak to you in next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. .

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-08-01 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, my name is Tasha and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Webcast Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Mr. Golden, you may begin your conference.
Stephen P. Golden: Thank you and welcome everyone to our 2008 second quarter earnings conference call. After my announcement this morning, Bob Brennan will give his state of the company remarks followed by Brian McKeon, who will deliver the financial review. When Brian is finished, we will open up the phones for Q&A. For our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to slide two, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2008 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release or the Safe Harbor language on this slide for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, operating income before D&A or OIBDA and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release. Before I turn the call over to Bob, I'd like to let you all know that our 11th Annual Investor Day will be held on Wednesday, October 8, 2008 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City. Stay tuned, we'll be releasing more information as it becomes available and the best way to stay informed is to sign up for e-mail alerts at the Investor Relations page of our website. And with that, I would like to introduce Bob Brennan, our President and CEO.
Bob Brennan: Thank you, Stephen. Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking the time to join us for our second quarter earnings call. The format we will use today is similar to our past calls. This is my first call as CEO and I'll start by giving you my report on how the business is doing and reference our strategy as we go through that. Afterwards, Brian will take you through the quarterly results and provide an update on our full-year outlook followed of course by Q&A. So let's get started. Here are the key messages I want you to hear today. First, Iron Mountain is performing well and we are on track to delivering against our full-year financial goals. Next, we are continuing to advance the growth strategy we have been delivering on for years, the strategy that's driven by solid expansion of our core business, which is of course supported by continuing strong growth and services that leverage the investments that we've made in storage, by expanding our international presence in markets where we see strong economics and then building scale for our digital business to meet large expanding market requirements. The last message that I'd like to drive home is that the team at Iron Mountain is taking a very disciplined approach to growing our business and that discipline is producing the desired results. I will now provide a quick summary of our Q2 financial performance, which Brian will review in detail after I'm done. Overall, we delivered strong revenue and OIBDA growth for the second quarter with each up 15% compared to the same period last year. Both numbers were at the high end of our guidance range and we also continued to drive strong growth across our major business segments with all segments performing well across the board. More specifically, there are three key areas I want to highlight that supported our strong Q2 financial performance. First, service revenues continued as a key driver of our overall growth. Second, our digital business is performing very, very well and third, we're really getting clear benefits from having a broad portfolio of businesses. So let's go to the service component first. Consistent with our long-term strategy, we're building off a strong storage revenue base, which continues to generate solid growth rates so that we can introduce new services that help our customers solve their information protection and storage problems. In the second quarter, overall revenue growth was led by service revenues, which were up 18% on a reported basis including benefits from acquisitions and 9% in terms of internal growth. We're seeing the positive benefits from our strategy to invest in services that leverage our strong storage relationships. Our international segment reported strong service growth, supported by continued momentum in Latin America where our Document Management Solutions continue to be a key growth driver as well as in Europe where we're seeing significant benefits this year from special projects specifically within the UK. North America also posted solid gains despite pressures impacting many of our customers. As you might expect, we are seeing some impact from a worsening economy on our complementary service revenue particularly with respect to more discretionary projects. At the same time, we are generating solid growth in our shredding business supported by strong paper prices and service volume growth. It's worth mentioning that Iron Mountain Digital also delivered a strong service revenue performance in Q2. In advancing our growth agenda, you should expect service revenues will continue to expand as a percentage of total revenues, which will in turn drive higher returns. This builds on our foundational storage relationships with our customers, maximizes our potential to service them and it does so with less capital intensity and therefore higher returns. In summary, we see the expansion of service revenues as central to maximizing our opportunity and our value as a company. With regards to Iron Mountain Digital, Iron Mountain Digital continues to perform quite well with 16% internal growth in Q2. Our eDiscovery, archival and intellectual property management businesses were all very strong contributors in this quarter. Iron Mountain Digital is the leader in providing digital storage as a service with annual run rate revenues approaching $250 million this year accompanied by solid returns. Our early vision as a storage and service provider is being validated as the market continues to expand at a rapid pace and continues to attract more competition. We believe we're particularly well positioned against the competition to capture our share growth because of two primary factors. First, is the Iron Mountain brand. Iron Mountain is a brand that's been built on trust because customers have really relied on us to protect their data for decades. We have no agenda in using their data and selling them equipment and doing anything other than providing them strong SLAs around the long-term preservation, protection and storage of their data. The second is our business model. Storage is a service that something that we started quite a long time ago, a supply wheel [ph] business that you're familiar with. And in digital just as in our physical businesses, it has the same recurring properties. It's taken us some time to get to $250 million in annualized run rate revenues for Iron Mountain Digital. If you think about our early entries through the Connected and LiveVault acquisitions, both those companies were started their revenue in the mid-90s. So, it takes time to build the business but it’s a very sticky business and it will take time and a very different mindset from our competitors to successfully drive this type of an approach. I think it's worth just settling on a point here. Our primary competition for Iron Mountain Digital is customers who seek to solve these problems themselves by purchasing hardware and software from traditional technology companies and running it in-house. We see that that’s moving towards us as companies become increasingly frustrated with the explosion of data that they are facing and the complexities of doing it themselves, not to mention the cost. So, we are pleased with our progress in Iron Mountain Digital and remain optimistic about our potential going forward. The third theme underlying our strong results is the strength of our business portfolio. We’ve evolved many businesses over the last decade all building off of our strong storage foundation and expanding our geographic reach and adding our service capability and providing a broader and broader range of customer solutions. All of our businesses are contributing whether you look at them by product or geography across the board. We will continue to invest against this strategy. Balanced of course with a disciplined focus on driving return improvement, this strategy has been working and we expect to continue to advance it. So, those are the three underlying themes to Q2 performance. So, as we go forward and drive our growth goals, we'll remain focused on management cost, especially given the softer economic environment we're all operating in. We are seeing some impacts from the economy on certain of our business. So in this contact, we are being particularly disciplined about prioritizing and concentrating our investments. In terms of managing cost, we're still working through higher cost growth effects from acquisitions and overhead investments that we initiated in 2007. At the same time, we are targeting and expect moderated overhead growth as we work through the second half for this year. I want you to know that we are committed to investing to advance our growth strategy. At the same time, we are also committing and committed to delivering against our annual financial objectives. I believe we can manage this balance effectively. Overall, our solid start to the year puts us on track to deliver our full-year goals. We made some positive revisions to our guidance this morning, which Brian will discuss in more detail. I will ask that you not get too excited about that. Our business remains solid, but as Richard has said many times nothing changes fast in this business and I promise we'll remain very disciplined to manage against our targets. A couple of important happenings in the past quarter that we've reported on and I would like to inform you more about and it's really... again, as it relates to service development and these are two new services that we rolled out during the quarter. One with the Accutrac, which is a small records management acquisition that we did last year where in the past, in Q2, we announced a partnership with a FileNet group within IBM to provide prescriptive records management solutions that enable an integrated approach for managing either paper or electronic documents. IBM is a burgeoning partner with us and also provides part of our Image on Demand solution into our Digital Record Center. The second is our most recent acquisition of Animus. Animus provides document workflow solutions that help our customers re-engineer workflow processes that have become real cumbersome without them losing control of that existing processes. So, for example, if you take documents associated with what can typically be bad workflow say, invoices into accounts payable or contracts within the legal department, we can help them take over that process by scanning those documents, indexing the documents, presenting them back to our customers through a web interface and then either preserving the original physical document or destroying it if the business requires. This gives us advantage both in software as a service, and storage as a service and driving recurring revenue and while Animus just joined the Iron Mountain family, we're encouraged by their potential. In general, acquisitions of new service capability is key to our strategy and we did tell you that acquisition activity would be modest this year and we are following through on that, in part because we had a relatively fast pace here in 2007 and I do want to update you that the integration of our three biggest acquisitions ArchivesOne, RMS and Stratify are all going particularly well and we are particularly excited about some of the potentials that we're seeing out of the eDiscovery space with our Stratify acquisition. And you should look for more news to come as they acquire a larger and larger footprint in that very fast-growing space. During the quarter, we also announced the tactical divestiture of one of our businesses. As we add to our service portfolio, we also want to ensure that we're sharply focused on performance management and strategic fit. And in the context of both, actually we made a decision to divest our commodity data product sales business in Q2. This is a small business comprising about 1% of our revenues that’s focused on the sale of commodity products to our customers where there was limited contribution to our profits. So, we really saw this and evaluated as a non-core business and entered into an agreement with another company for them to manage this business where we will receive a royalty on future sales. That is my report on Q2. I want you to know that Iron Mountain is doing well and that the team is committed to a disciplined growth strategy that maximizes our long-term potential while delivering consistently strong annual financial results. I am very pleased with our performance year-to-date and believe that we're on track to delivering against our stated objectives for the remainder of the year. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian for today's financial review. Brian?
Brian P. McKeon: Thanks, Bob. Q2 was another solid quarter for Iron Mountain keeping us on track to meet our full year financial goals. We posted strong revenue and OIBDA gains slightly ahead of our forecast. These results reflect solid underlying business performance across our business segments. We will begin today with a review of our Q2 results. We will also review our year-to-date cash flow performance, capital spending trends and debt positions and put these results in the context of our full-year outlook. We will conclude with an update of our 2008 full-year guidance, which has been positively revised today reflecting our solid first half results. We'll also share our outlook for the third quarter. Slide four highlights the key messages from today's review. Iron Mountain delivered strong financial results in Q2 with revenue and OIBDA each growing 15%. We continued to drive strong business performance in a challenging economic environment. This reflects the strength of our business model as well as benefits from a disciplined approach to managing our operations. We posted high revenue gains across all major business units, supported by 9% internal growth, the benefits of our major acquisitions and favorable year-over-year foreign currency movements. OIBDA was supported by solid gains in gross profit, which offset some dilutive impacts from acquisitions completed last year and some carryover impacts from investments initiated in 2007. We also strengthened our balance sheet increasing flexibility and liquidity with the successful refinancing transaction including the sale of $300 million of 8% bonds due 2020 and the redemption of $72 million of 8.25% bonds due 2011. The redemption was completed in early July. As a result of our first half performance we announced positive revisions to our 2008 outlook. We now expect 12% to 13% revenue growth and 11% to 14% comparable OIBDA growth for the year. We remain confident that we are on track towards achieving these full-year financial goals. One item of note before we continue, as mentioned in our press release this morning, we divested ourselves of our commodity product sales business as of June 1st. Accordingly, we're removing the revenues associated with this business from our internal growth calculations for both 2007 and 2008. The impact of this divestiture is reflected in our updated guidance. Now, let's move on to looking at the details of our performance on slide five. Slide five compares results for this quarter to Q2 of 2007. Overall we had another strong revenue quarter supported by balanced growth across our key business segments, which drove the overall increase of 15%. Our largest segment in North American Physical posted a 11% growth overall. Internal revenue growth was 8%. We saw a solid growth in secure shredding supported by continued strength in recycled paper prices and in our data protection business. These gains offset some softness in project-based revenues. Despite these impacts, internal growth in North America is tracking solidly within our target growth range for the year. Our international physical business was up 21% overall. Internal growth was 9% supported by continued strength in our Latin America business and gains in complementary service revenues in our European business. International growth also benefited from select acquisitions that are strengthening our global footprint and from favorable foreign exchange changes, which together added about 12% to revenue gains. Finally, our Digital segment drove strong revenue gains growing 37% overall supported by 16% internal growth. We saw a consistent growth in storage revenues and better than expected performance in data restoration projects, which had been relatively week since the end of 2005. Revenue gains helped drive a solid 17% year-over-year improvement in gross profit. Gross margins were up about 100 basis points for the quarter compared to the same prior-year period supported by improved storage margins reflecting labor and real estate efficiencies as well as benefits from growth in the high-margin services and sustained higher recycled paper pricing. SG&A growth was 20% in the quarter compared to prior-year levels. Higher rates of overhead growth were impacted by two primary factors highlighted on our last conference call. The first involves the integration of recent technology acquisitions including Stratify, which have a relatively higher overhead cost basis as a percentage of revenues. SG&A growth also reflects carry-over impact from investments in security, international sales resources and infrastructure initiated in 2007 as well additional stock option expense related to higher than normal grant activity last year. We expect SG&A growth to continue at higher rates through Q3 and to moderate in the fourth quarter of this year as most of the ramp in acquisition and overhead investment took place in Q4 of 2007. Despite these effects, OIBDA was up 15% for the quarter to a $197 million. Depreciation was $64 million and amortization was $9 million for the quarter. The increase in the amortization was driven primarily by technology acquisitions completed in the second half of 2007. Operating income was $124 million for Q2 2008, up 11% versus the prior year as OIBDA gains were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization driven by 2007 capital spending in acquisitions. Slide six, breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions in foreign exchange, which added about 4% and 3% respectively to our growth rates for the second quarter. Internal revenue growth for the quarter was 9%, in range of our full-year growth goals. As a reminder, we removed the 2007 and 2008 revenues associated with the divested product sales business from our internal growth calculations. This had no impact on the internal growth rates we reported for Q1. Internal growth was comprised of 8% storage growth and 9% service growth reflecting continued benefits from expansion of less capital intensive, more project based offerings. Core service internal growth improved to 9% in Q2 supported by benefits from higher fuel surcharges. The internal growth rate for complementary services moderated in Q2 as expected. Growth of recycled paper revenues across geographies remains strong supported by year-on-year increases in recycled paper pricing. Offsetting these gains was a slowdown in project activity in the Americas and lower growth in fulfillment services, which are areas more likely to be impacted by economic conditions. Complementary service revenue, which represents nearly 15% of overall revenues can fluctuate over time, given fluctuations in demand and timing for a special project activity and variation of factors such as recycled paper pricing. As noted in our last call, we do expect growth in complementary services to moderate as we work through this year due to comparisons to some large European public sector projects that either completed or winding down. We also expect some continued pressure on more discretionary spending areas in the Americas given the current economic slowdown. Despite these anticipated impacts, we expect that our overall internal growth rates will remain solid through the year and believe that we're on track to deliver against our full year internal growth goals. Moving on with our review of Q2 P&L performance, slide seven reviews our Q2 operating income to net income and EPS results. Q2 results on these fronts were basically as expected although we did experience some discrete impacts, which pressured our reported net income and EPS results for the quarter. As discussed, operating income for the quarter was up 11% to $124 million as OIBDA gains were partially offset by year-on-year increases in depreciation and amortization. D&A grew $13 million versus prior-year levels in Q2 reflecting increased CapEx spending and the impact of our 2007 acquisitions, most notably, ArchivesOne and Stratify, which were completed in May and December 2007 respectively. Our Q2 interest expense was $60 million as expected and in line with Q1. We now expect interest for the full year to be in the range of $240 million to $245 million, including the impact of the recent refinancing activities I spoke of earlier. Other expense was $4 million or $0.01 per share in Q2 primarily reflecting losses related to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we mark our inter company and third party debt to market. We also recorded approximately $350,000 of debt-extinguishment charges in Q2 related to our due in 2008 debt offering. In the second quarter of 2007, we reported other income of $3 million or $0.01 per share related primarily to foreign currency exchange rate gains and insurance gains. Net income and EPS were $36 million and $0.18 per diluted share respectively, down slightly from the 2007 levels due primarily to a higher effective tax rate in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. As a reminder, we've recorded significant tax benefits on net gains associated with foreign currency rate changes in the second quarter of 2007. This year, our second quarter tax rate before the impact of discrete items was 38%, as forecasted. The impact of discrete of items, including the interest on our tax reserves added three points to our effective tax rate and reduced diluted EPS by about $0.01 per share. We're still estimating our tax rate before discrete items for 2008 to be approximately 38%. After 2008, we expect our tax rate excluding the impact of discrete items, to decrease over time to approximately 36%. Turning to slide eight, let's look at our year-to-date performance. You can see that our Q2 results build on the solid performance we posted in Q1. Overall balance growth across our key businesses and service lines is supporting solid revenue and OIBDA gains and reinforcing our confidence that we're on track towards delivering against our strategic and financial goals this year. Net income for the first half of 2008 was $69 million compared to $74 million for the same period in 2007. The key factors impacting the 2008 results are other income, which was $3 million or $0.01 per diluted share versus $11 million or $0.04 per share in 2007 and a higher effective tax rate, which was 38% this year versus 33% in 2007. Let's now shift to reviewing drivers of our cash flow performance. Slide nine summarizes our capital spending for the quarter. It highlights our year-to-date results compared to the full year 2007 amounts and our current 2008 outlook, which we're reiterating today. Our CapEx for the first half of 2008 was at $137 million including $11 million for real estate. Traditionally, the first half of the year is lighter with respect to CapEx as some projects are scheduled for later in the year and many require a time to plan and source before the significant expenditures are eventually made. We are currently spending to our plan and expect to finish the year within the forecasted range. Let us now move on to slide ten and look at free cash flow for the quarter. Slide ten highlights our year-to-date cash flow performance compared to the same period in 2007. For the first half of 2008, free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $20 million. The year-on-year decrease in cash flow reflects the payment in Q1 2008 of the unusually large 2007 year-end CapEx accrual balance of $60 million and $30 million increase in working capital usage. The working capital increase was due primarily to increased AR, increased incentive compensation payments in 2008 and the timing of payroll check run [ph]. Keep in mind our free cash flow was best looked at on a full-year basis as the timing of certain cash events is not consistent through the year. For example, the first quarter, historically our lowest cash flow quarter, was impacted by the 2007 CapEx accrual and the payment of annual bonuses. For 2008, we expect free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to be approximately $25 million to $75 million. As noted in our last call, 2008 free cash flow is impacted by the 2007 CapEx accrual I just spoke of being paid in Q1. Now, let's turn to slide 11 to review over debt statistics. In terms of our debt portfolio, we ended Q2 2008 in a strong position as we can see in the slide. Our weighted average interest rate is 7.2% and we are 81% fixed. Consolidated leverage is now 4.4 times within our target range of 4 to 5 times of OIBDA. Maturity is now at 7.8 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2012. As you know, we successfully issued 300 million of 8% senior subordinated notes due 2020. We used the net proceeds to pay down our senior credit facility. We also redeemed the remaining $72 million of outstanding 8.25% notes due in 2011 in a transaction that was completed in early July. This is the regular term out of our short-term debt consistent with past practice. Rates may come down considerably over the preceding several months and were reasonable compared to our long-term average. Based on our ability to execute a transaction at attractive rates and our expectations of continued uncertainty in the credit markets, we felt that it was the right time for this refinancing. Our ability to issue debt at attractive rates in an uncertain credit market demonstrates the strength of the Iron Mountain business model. As a result of these activities, our liquidity position remains strong. As of June 30th, 2008, we had nearly $715 million of cash at availability under our revolving credit facility. Now, let's move ahead to slide 12 to discuss our 2008 guidance. Turning to slide 12, based on our solid start to the year, we're announcing positive revisions to our full-year outlook. Our full-year revenue outlook is now $3.15 billion to $3.19 billion or growth of 12% to 13%. We are now targeting full-year operating income of $478 million to $498 million. This would imply an OIBDA range of $773 million to $793 million for the year or growth of 11% to 14% on a comparable basis, excluding gains and losses on asset write-downs. We are maintaining our full-year CapEx forecast of $440 million to $480 million. At midpoint performance, this could equate to a modest reduction in capital spending as a percent of sales in 2008 building on our 2007 progress. Our expectations for Q3 performance are shown here as well, which implies revenue growth of 8% to 10% and 4% to 9% comparable OIBDA growth. Note that our prior-year Q2 results were benefited from high levels of service growth, which resulted in 12% internal growth and strong OIBDA margin flow through. Our growth outlook for Q3 of this year reflects comparisons to these strong results. We'll continue to work through higher levels of cost growth in Q3 as well driven by acquisition integration and carryover impacts from investments initiated in 2007. As noted, we expect these impacts to moderate in the fourth quarter. In summary, we had a solid first half of the year. We are driving solid growth across our business and we're confident that we're on track towards delivering our full-year financial objectives. Thanks, and we'll now open the phones to take your questions. Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh: Thank you. Hi, I wonder if you could give us a sense of... very nice job on the gross margins in the second quarter. How do you see that gross margins playing out in the second half of the year relative to OIBDA overall?
Brian P. McKeon: Yes, we're continuing to target solid gross margins in 2008. We're seeing things... factors such as real estate and productivity gains helping us, these were the things we expect when we built our plans this year. And we're also currently seeing benefits from paper and higher margin service growth. Those are factors that will moderate later this year but our outlook includes sustaining solid gross margins.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. And if you could give us a sense of in terms of recycled paper prices, where they are currently and what do you have in the outlook in the second half of the year?
Brian P. McKeon: Yes, we're... the recycled paper market has flattened in recent months, it's actually down a bit from some of the peaks we saw in February and March. It would still... it can be up year-on-year at current rate to the back half of the year. We think that the underlying factors that have supported the higher levels of paper pricing, which are really driven by international demand are still there. As you know, this isn't an easy market to forecast, but we think we'll see sustained solid paper rates. But if you want to reinforce that this is the factor we've highlighted several times in the past. These things can fluctuate, it can have an impact on our results with the margin and were basically embedded in our outlook is in expectation that will sustain in the similar range. So, but this is something we'll keep an eye on.
Bob Brennan: And we are being particularly careful, Kevin, to moderate overhead growth as we go through the balance of the year, something that we're just... we're very, very careful about.
Kevin McVeigh: Okay. If I could just one more question if you don't mind. The core services really, sequentially came up nicely internally. Can you talk about destructions a little bit and how the surcharges impacted that?
Brian P. McKeon: Yes. Two different...two different topics that you have raised there, say the... we highlighted in the… our last call where we saw a little softness on core service activity that was down a bit with… in areas like destructions because we had higher activities late last year. And that's pretty much the same, I would say our overall core service activity is a little below what we would see normally. And that's not unexpected given some of the things that highlighted [inaudible] last year.
Bob Brennan: There is a cost associated with destructions to the people who are pausing on now because they face their own overhead pressure. And while they saw the usefulness of during that maybe even just a matter of months ago, they are now holding on that project revenue.
Brian P. McKeon: But, the second topic which you picked up on we did highlight in the call was the improvement kind of quarter-on-quarter because the growth rate went up a couple... 200 basis points was... it was helped by higher fuel surcharges. Obviously, that is offsetting some of the higher energy costs that we see. So, net net it really helps us to manage energy impacts and keep that effect at a minimal level. It's not intended to be a profit driver for the company but it does benefit us in terms of our core service growth rate.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, gentlemen. I'm trying to look at EBITDA margins sequentially. They went from 28... $23.9 to $25.5 in the quarter first quarter versus second quarter this year, a 160 basis point increase. If you could break out for us, what do you think the drivers are there, and specifically [ph] one, what's a normal seasonal pickup, I know first quarter is the low quarter of the year usually on margin? Two, kind of less drag from past acquisitions and three kind of just maybe less incremental investment in our infrastructure?
Bob Brennan: If I can just start with, Andrew, I just wanted... we have been... we've tried to being very careful but this is not how we manage the business right. We don't…
Andrew Steinerman: Right.
Bob Brennan: So, with that in mind, we can get into the specific answers.
Brian P. McKeon: Yes. I think Andrew one of the things, I'm trying to get at the gist of your question. I mean I do think we look at our business more year-on-year rather than quarter-to-quarter.
Andrew Steinerman: Right.
Brian P. McKeon: I would say year-on-year, we made improved progress on gross margin enhancements, which was driven by several things. Actually, it included the solid productivity gains in the storage front. We had higher levels of service margin growth, it's a high growth in areas where we have high service margins, areas like Stratify like our Digital business and we have... those factors are helping and continued benefit from the recycled paper pricing, but I think those factors were probably sequentially a bit better for us. I think we're seeing some moderation in the overhead cost impacts. We'll continue to see that as we work through the year. It's going to be more a Q4 benefit than a Q3 benefit. And those are related to two kind of key drivers and I think both of those factors are things that we hope to sustain. So, if you look at our outlook for the back half of the year, in implies that we will have improvement in year-on-year margins assuming our mix comes in as we expect and that reflects sustaining that good gross margin performance and maintaining good discipline overhead cost growth. So, we look forward to continue to force progress on that front. The one thing I would caution you on is, and this was something Richard reinforced in the last call is kind of taking the ruler out and looking at a quarter and drawing a line off of that. I mean, we do have seasonality impacts in this business, we do manage this business on an annual basis and our discussion day is just focused on back half of the year. We haven't given any outlook or insight into next year.
Andrew Steinerman: Right, right. That's why I asked the question originally sequentially to account for seasonality but it sounds like when you are answering year-over-year and probably was some help seasonally , sequentially plus the other factors that you just attributed year-over-year also helping this sequential progress as well.
Brian P. McKeon: That's fair. And Q1 historically is our lower-margin quarter just given the higher relative energy costs and just...
Andrew Steinerman: That's right.
Brian P. McKeon: [inaudible]
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you very much.
Bob Brennan: Thanks, Andrew
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger: Hi. Thanks, good morning.
Bob Brennan: Good morning.
Scott Schneeberger: Just following up right there on energy and some question on pricing, obviously you're getting the fuel surcharges and that's contributing to the growth. The impact of higher energy cost, is that, I would assume that’s hitting more on the gross margin than it is on SG&A. Could you just confirm that and also discuss how your fuel surcharges work? How much of your client base is on that for what term of a contract and are you hedging fuel at all?
Brian P. McKeon: Well, Scott, the net of it all, it's a limited impact on our financial results. We don't hedge on fuel, it's about 3% of our total costs are energy related… 3% of revenue, sorry... thank you, 1.5% of which are transportation related. We're able to pass most of that through, if not all that through, but in some cases we have contracts where it doesn't go through other cases we do. Our buildings are very energy efficient and relatively quiet from an energy consumption perspective but the net of it is that we hear a lot of questions on this front and it doesn't have material impact on our financial results [inaudible] across.
Scott Schneeberger: Okay, thanks. Kind of shifting gears a bit. I think you'd have alluded when you were discussing Stratify and I mean I got the sense that you may be looking to expand or potentially do acquisitions in that space to pad. Was my inference correct and are you going to be thinking about doing large things or more of that tuck-in [ph] in the nature?
Bob Brennan: Scott, I have a great confidence in the team with Stratify and in the business that this builds to the extent that you will find that we generally partner with folks before we acquire them. So you can, generally speaking, see those things coming. We've partnered with Connected and LiveVault long before we locked them. And I think fundamentally, we've great faith in that team, nothing big coming but we are always looking for potential candidates to partner with and that can act as a precursor to acquisition.
Brian P. McKeon: Scott I think in Bob's comment, he was alluding more to a... we feel really good about the team and have some pending customer wins that we look forward to talking abut. It wasn't intended to be a reference to acquisition.
Bob Brennan: Yes. You'll see them expand their market presence.
Brian P. McKeon: [inaudible] platform we've got and the discovery with the Stratify team.
Bob Brennan: It's a great, great team.
Scott Schneeberger: Excellent, thanks. Jumping back real quick on... as far as what I meant to follow-up with on the surcharges as well was... I think pricing you had alluded this year that you're looking to get maybe a 2% increase. Any update there and how you look at that in combination with the surcharge?
Brian P. McKeon: We don't look at the surcharges, what we would think of is pricing and I think that's a relationship we have with our customers where we are trying to mitigate offset costs. And I think our ongoing service relationships looking at our pricing we had talked about improving our trend on that front. And we're making good progress. We think we are on track to achieve. The metric we typically talk to is the U.S. hard copies, storage price and how that's increased over time. And we are on track towards that 2% level, which we think is consistent with the value that we are delivering to our customers. And we feel good about the progress we're making there.
Scott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks. And then finally, you announced recently the collaboration with IBM and partnership with HP, is this something… I mean, are we seeing the start of a trend here of something you're going to be doing a lot more, just partnerships? And could you give us an update on how those are going?
Bob Brennan: Sure. So we feel very good about our relationship with HP for medical image archiving and the one that we just announced with Accutrac. I think you should expect to see more of it. We have a great opportunity to move our technology through others P&Ls and to move their technology integrated with ours… through ours. It's a valuation of the brand that we have in the market, the trust that we've created with our customers and the technology that we have acquired, through our internal bills as well as through the teams and technology required at Stratify [inaudible] Connected, LiveVault. These are technologies that are unique and differentiated in the market where there is sustainable competitive advantage and interest from some of the largest players and technology today. So, I would expect our… the amount of business that we are driving through alternative channels to increase slowly over time. These things to take… these partnerships take longer than everybody expects because we do it from a recurring revenue prospective. They have a much slower build but a much longer duration.
Scott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks so much.
Bob Brennan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Gold with Sidoti.
David Gold: Brian, I wanted to follow up a little bit on your comments about SG&A moderating in the fourth quarter. Should I understand that as a function basically some of the say more discretionary items like security spending pullback or spending telling off on that or are you more saying that we anniversaried the increase in expense last year so it's going to be more a function of that?
Brian P. McKeon: It is going back to what some of the drivers have been year-to-date, the bigger driver was actually the impact of some of the technology acquisitions that we did last year and ran that into our cost base and Stratify was completed in December of last year and we'll start to see moderating impact from that factor. We did step up the investment in the areas that we had highlighted in terms of security and international sales resources. We're still investing in those areas. We just don't have to step up. We have been, as Bob mentioned, been very mindful about prioritizing our investments in the current climate and we are balancing investments against our strategy with making sure that they are calibrated against our top line growth. So those are factors that are contributing. One thing I would highlight is, as you recall in our fourth quarter call last year we had, every year we have a level of drew ups and accruals and things of that nature at year-end time and last year, we had a number of things that kind of went in one direction that impacted us negatively to the tune of about $5 million. Keep in mind, we are not expecting that. We always are going to have some variation, but we are kind of expecting normal activity this year. So that's a $5 million kind of lapping benefit in terms of cost growth that's built into our Q4 expectations. So it is all of those factors combined in.
David Gold: Okay. And some of the discretionaries, probably a bad word, but the more discretionary items there are like, let's say, securing some of ones that you have marked out, were those more front-end loaded or they fairly evenly spread out?
Bob Brennan: It is a pretty even spread, it’s something that we plan over a long period of time if you are going to be fortifying transportation fleet or training an employee base or facility infrastructures, it’s planned over a long period of time. So it is pretty smooth and from our perspective, we have a series of core values, David, inside of Iron Mountain and consider secured to be job one, but it's not a discretionary expense from our perspective. We don't view ourselves vis-à-vis our competition, we view ourselves vis-à-vis our value proposition. And that’s an area that we will continue to invest although to the untrained it could appear to be over investing but we are about the long-term preservation and security and storage of our customers’ data. So, that will be an area that we will perpetually invest in.
David Gold: Sure. Much appreciated, Bob. And then just, one other, can you remind us what the '07 revenue contribution was from the product sales business that were divesting?
Brian P. McKeon: It was about 1% of our revenues last year since a relatively small business and had pretty limited profit contribution. So it was, as Bob mentioned, something that wasn't as larger business. As you look balance here in our growth rate, keep in mind that's factored into how we think about gross. So that will offset much of the acquisition benefits that we have seen, but it was a relatively small business and shouldn't have a big impact on our bottom line.
David Gold: Terrific. Thank you, both.
Bob Brennan: Thanks, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michel Morin with Merrill Lynch.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, this is David Ribenmine [ph] for Michel. Can you... just a question on the impact of higher gross margin acquisitions and then the divestiture of the lower gross margin data products business. Could you sort of quantify that impact... that net impact on gross margins?
Bob Brennan: The... I am just trying to follow your... the benefit of technology acquisition growth and the impacts of the product sales fees.
Unidentified Analyst: Right. So you devastated a relatively lower gross margin business and you also acquired relatively higher gross margin businesses as I'm just trying to get the impact of those two effects?
Bob Brennan: Yes, we don't get down to fine tuning the numbers at that level, but I would say that they are moving in different directions and are... they are one of the bigger factors impacting our gross margin performance in the quarter. So that helps in the context, it was... there is some impact out there but it wasn't highlighted, it’s one of the bigger factors.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then, can you remind us what percentage of your revenues are in the complementary services area?
Brian P. McKeon: It's overall for our company, annually it's about 15% of our total revenues.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
Bob Brennan: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Franco Turrinelli with William Blair.
Bob Brennan: Good morning, Franco.
Franco Turrinelli: Good morning, guys. Actually questions for Brian. Brian I just wanted to see if we can clarify, one of the previous questions has concerned me a little bit. There was an implication that the fuel surcharges had a material impact on the growth of our services and I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more of clarity on that?
Brian P. McKeon: It's… what I was referring to core service growth and the question was seemed to have improved from Q1 to Q2. And we did hire... it was 7% in Q1 and 9% in Q2, Franco, and just highlighted at the margin I think that's [inaudible] on that particular service line is increased fuel surcharges. And I just want to highlight that that's just have some impact at the margin on things like core service growth, it doesn't really have... has not had a significant profit impact because it really just offsets higher energy costs.
Franco Turrinelli: Great. Thank you, congratulations.
Brian P. McKeon: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of David Rainey with Akre Capital.
David Rainey: Could you all just remind us, I was looking on slide nine and down, how do you all think about maintenance CapEx spent to maintain the earnings power of your assets versus growth CapEx? Is it caption on the slide or is it additional information you could share?
Bob Brennan: We don't disclose that in our regular reporting. We do make reference in our SEC filings that we estimate overall as a company that about 15% of our capital spending over time, there has been what we categorize as more maintenance oriented. If you think about the nature of our business in a way, the capital intensity is typically about adding physical and now digital storage capacity as we had records, physical records or bits and bytes that we were storing. So, the bulk of our capital investments are more growth oriented and what we would characterize as more maintenance oriented capital is a smaller percentage of the total. It is important to understand in terms of our business, because we're a growth business and because we're deploying growth capital that limits to a degree our cash flow in the near term, but we believe that over the long-term, given that the maintenance capital is relatively low on our business that it... our business had very attractive long-term cash flow characteristics.
David Rainey: Okay. So then 15% of your CapEx guidance for the year would be about $70 million?
Brian P. McKeon: You know that math would work, we don't get that specific and how we talk about guidance, it's more directional, an estimate of what percentage of our spending over a period of time has been maintenance in nature.
David Rainey: Okay. And then... excuse me, I've got a follow-up and that is across your different lines of business, how do you all look internally at forecasting rates of return on growth in Digital, core storage services versus the potential for share repurchases? And I don't ask this so much in the context of when are you going buy stock in the third quarter or the fourth quarter. I'm just thinking about it in the context of everyday management has a decision whether or not they pay dividend buying shares, pay down debt, sit on their cash or invest in growth assets. And so I'm just curious as to how you all look at that framework to work to optimize the business long-term?
Brian P. McKeon: Just as a principle, you should know that we have... we're very focusing just on our management of capital, we control our capital decisions centrally. As I highlighted... we highlighted last year in our Investor Day discussion, we... our financial objectives imply in return on incremental invested capital of 15% to 20% and we believe we have very attractive opportunities to invest in our business and deploy capital in that front and we look at those type of metrics as we make capital decisions. We did highlight that overtime given our... the profile of our business and objectives and our ability to attract investment that we may have the opportunity for funds beyond what's required to invest in attractive opportunities in our business and have not made any decisions on that front relative to deploying those funds. We did highlight share repurchases and dividends as options, but we don't have any news on that front at this time.
Bob Brennan: And that’s a finance discussion that happens between a few of us and with the Board of Directors from a day-to-day prospective, we're really focused on how we are driving returns with the growth out of our core business and juxtaposing that against and clearing that with investments that we can make in international expansion and expanding our service base. That's the strategy that operating team focuses on a day-to-day basis. So, it's really not our day-to-day business to talk about. Returning cash to shareholders, that's a very limited discussion that's controlled centrally.
David Rainey: And okay. Just to follow-up, when you talk about 15% to 20% incremental returns on invested capital, are you discussing that on a levered or unlevered basis taxed or untaxed, how do you all think about that?
Brian P. McKeon: That's a metric that's really looking at the incremental OIBDA we expect to generate for the capital that we are deploying. It's a pre-tax number and it's unlevered.
David Rainey: Thank you.
Bob Brennan: David, thank you for your question. I do very much appreciate all of your support. We are at the end of our hour. Thanks for your support of Iron Mountain. To the extent that you can enjoy any of your summer that's remaining, please do. And we'll look forward to seeing you on October 8 in New York City at the Grand Hyat Hotel for our Annual Investor Day and again on October 30th for our next earnings call. Thank you all and have a good day.

Analysts: Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley Andrew Steinerman - Bear Stearns David Gold - Sidoti Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer Franco Turrinelli - William Blair Edward Atorino - Benchmark Andrea Hirth - Robert Baird
Operator: Good morning, my name is Tina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Iron Mountain Q1 2008 Earnings Webcast Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any backgrounds noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Mr. Golden, you may begin your conference.
Stephen P. Golden - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you and welcome everyone to our 2008 first quarter earnings conference call. After my announcements this morning, Richard Reese will give his state of the company remarks, followed by Brian McKeon, who will deliver the financial review. When Brian is finished, we will open up the phones for Q&A. For our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to slide two, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2008 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release or the Safe Harbor language on this slide for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements. As you know, operating income before D&A are OIBDA and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website as well in today's press release. Before I turn the call over to Richard, I would like to let you know that our 2007 Annual Report will be available on our website later today. I encourage you all to visit the site and take a look at the report. It's a great report, and hopefully you will find it useful. With that, I would like to introduce Richard Reese, our Chairman and CEO.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Steve and good morning everybody and welcome to this Q1 call. As you saw from our announcement today, our business is performing well and we're really on track for delivering against our annual financial goals. The strategy continues to match not just the financial performance, we are showing solid growth throughout our business and efficiency gains, which according to our strategy we are using to fund our new service expansion and expansion of our global footprint. So, basically as I have said many times, it has been business as usual and this was a good quarter, business as usual quarter for us. So, let’s talk a little bit about it. It was a good start for the year and gives us the confidence that we will have a year as we have forecast. But, as you know, most of the time we are able to bring our years in on an annual basis and again we expect to do it this year. We saw solid gains across most of… or all of our business segments and there was modest acquisition activity slower than last year, as we expected. We've told you before that last year was sort of an unusual high year for recent history, and we expect this year to be back down and in fact it is back down as we told you it would be. Good revenue growth of 18% and solid internal revenue of 9%. The quarter benefited from the acquisition activity that was strong last year and most of the deals closed after the end of first quarter. So, you will see that year-to-year comparison coming off a little bit as the year goes through. Also strong benefits from FX. FX added 3% to the total revenue growth, about a third of our revenue now is outside of the United States or outside the US dollar. And of course our reported benefits... our reported results have benefited from the weakening dollar. I should remind you of course that one day… in some part in the future, if the dollar turns around, we will see the other side of that curve. But, right now, it's on the positive side for us on a reported basis. Solid storage growth, remained in the ranges we predicted and remain good at 8%. Storage represents about 54% of our total revenues and it was up for the 77th consecutive quarter. But, as you know, those who have followed our business long-time, storage is really the driver, it's off of the storage which we drive all other services and our relationships that we create through storage are what we are using as the basis of our expansion of our new services strategy. So, we saw that storage growth. Good performance, both in our physical businesses, as well as our digital business. It is a large flywheel. It is what keeps the business rolling regardless good times and bad times. Over the years, I have talked a lot about the large number and how hard it is to keep growing something this big. We seem to find ways to do it and that's something partly because of good execution of our organization and sales force, and partly because we operate in a real favorable market, which information continues to grow and we continue to benefit through that. Service was also good, at 10% internal growth, 23% overall, that represents the other 46% of our revenue. We saw some moderation in what we term core service, growth for the quarter, that was primarily related to our destructions, which slowed a bit from Q1. We have seen some acceleration on the destruction activity, where customers were restoring old information in the second half of last year, and we saw that acceleration come off some in Q1. It does historically tend to go on those sort of patterns, unfortunately, and they are not predictable what the patterns are precisely as customers make decisions to clean up programs, sometimes you have seen acceleration and then it comes back to normal, and we've seen that pattern and we seam to be setback to a normal patent now we believe. Offsetting, that we saw strong… and we've seen this trend for sometime, our complementary service growth is, as we’ve talked about those, those are kind of our own categories of types of services that really complement our business that is it, they are not directly, in most is, driven off of our storage relationships, but the things we can do for customers. Of course, we have this relationship, because we have the knowledge, because we have the skill, and we have right proposition they are looking for. We are continuing to invest in those spaces. We are continuing the see good performance there. This particular quarter, the international businesses did a really good job in that space. We also benefited for higher recycle paper prices in our shredding business and stronger than forecasted license sales in some of our digital business. So, as I said, all in all, just a good quarter all the way across the board. Total service revenue growth was up 23% and of course the difference between internal growth and others besides FX was because of acquisitions. The two way acquisitions that really benefited the service sides where RMS and our Stratify acquisitions. Our strategy has been to invest in services that complement our strong storage relationships and so just to make a comment about that this has been a long theme for us and it is working. It is continuing to drive our growth rate and it does some other things for us. It also changes the characteristics of the business. So. I am in little more volatile due to lack of predictability in some of these categories. But, service, as a percentage of revenue, will continue to expand, not quarter in, quarter out, and nothing happens that way in this business. But, that will be the long-term trend. We are investing and try to make that happen because really what's happing is, we are investing in services that are much lower capital investment required that can benefit from our relationships that we do drive our storages. You know, storages are high capital service line or product line. It turns around… most of these services have lower margins than our storage. So, you get the overall margin mix impact, but net-net, it drives and helps increase return on investing capital, as well as deepens the relationships with our customers, which are all good things as far as we are concerned. So, net-net, we feel good about the business. We remain solid and stable. On the top-line, regardless of the economy, we seem to do pretty well right now. So, we are feeling good. On the OIBDA basis, OIBDA growth $0.14% in the quarter, excluding some one-time losses of about $3.5 million for prior quarters, on a comparison basis. We saw good upside coming from OIBDA, both flow-through revenue performance, good profit flow-through. Although the OIBDA was constrained a bit by higher SG&A than in past, these were expected. So, it is not something we didn't expect and something we basically had forecasted and Brian will get in all the great details on this. But, a big part of how the SG&A really is the... is starting to fold in the acquisitions, particularly the digital services acquisition of Stratify, Accutrac and things like that come with higher... they come with different financial characteristics. Typically, they come with higher gross margins, but also much higher SG&A side. And we are starting to see some of that shift as we integrate those kinds of acquisitions. We also launched some new digital services, particularly our Digital Record Center for Medical Images, which is designed to store online medical images such as MRIs, CAT Scans, and so forth. It's one of the largest growth segments of digital data on the planet in partnership with Hewlett-Packard, HP Technology and then a combined sales effort, we found a market with them and we did start across some of that during the quarter. All this are good things that we are doing in the acquisition space, as well as in the new services startup. But, as I said, changes to mix a little bit and it causes some initial investment as we put it all together. We also initiated investments late last year and some of that flowed through into Q1. We spoke about that though Q4, in the call for Q4, related to increased investments in some of our systems and processes to strengthen chain of custody and security of customer assets, and of course we are continuing to build out sales resources in our continental market... continental Europe markets and other international markets. It's a trend we went through on a big way in North America, as some might remember, we accelerated investments to sales as we learnt how to do it and we saw the benefit of that overtime and we are learning in our international markets how to get better and better at that. These are good markets and they growing at strong double-digits for us. So, we are investing more in increasing the growth and going for market share over there. We do expect some of these cost impacts, and Brian, as I said, will get into detail, will moderate later in the year on a comparison basis. The key message here, which you'll hear over and over from us, is we are not managing the business quarter-to-quarter, it was a good quarter, but we are focused on delivering the annual goals. A good start always helps you feel better, by doing that... I understand there are skeptics out there. People always have to have something to worry about, but look at this as a long trend. The business is doing fine. As I said, we are feeling good about it. On the acquisition front, I did say it was modest, and it was modest. There was a nice shredding business in New Zealand, fitting our strategy of taking many of our core services and expanding our global reach with it. We learnt how to do something and where there is a good market opportunity and there is a good return, we are going after it and shredding is one of those... not in all markets, there are not good opportunities in all markets, at least not yet. But, there are good markets in that we are not in, and we will continue to expand there. We’ve made a small hard copy fold-in in Oklahoma, so that was just about putting two small businesses together and driving for scale. And those are the kinds of things we are focused on doing in our acquisition strategy in certain parts of the world. After the end of the quarter, we bought out a minority interest partner in Brazil and this was a successful round trip. We had a partner since 2001. With that partner and working together, we’ve built a very nice business in Brazil, over 1,000 employees in four markets. And Brazil is one of the real large… if you look at long-term, most people will tell you that growth over the long haul, and you can look at India, China, Russia, and Brazil, and if you notice carefully in the last 24 months, we have gone to India, China, Russia and we've been investing in Brazil and there is a reason for that, because we are looking to the long-term. Just like we don't run the business quarter-to-quarter, we can do it, we don’t always run it year-to-year. We are thinking about what this business will look like in ten years and periods after that. We also acquired a small amount minority interest, 15% in a Swiss business. That has been a market… that’s one of these places in Europe that we have had trouble finding a good entry point. We think we have found a good end point now. So, we can start to… frankly start to serve pan-European customers in a different way and some of our global customers in a different way. The other thing I want to talk briefly about was the Stratify acquisition. We closed that in December 2007. So, we've had a little time now on it to understand what we have gotten so forth. It was our third largest digital acquisitions… it's our third digital acquisition and our largest digital acquisition. As I said, we acquired in 2007 and the integration process is proceeding as we planed. Their Q1 results were excellent and ahead of our expectations. So, they are off to a good start. In fact, I just spent three... two and a half days in their offices in California last week and just spending time with the team and other people just to get really deep under the hood. I want to leave it alone for a while and let them get a good quarter and which they did. So, I started bugging them, because not only have a good business, we have got a tremendous organization. It is tremendous technologies and skills on the shelf that when I first took a hard look at him I had a good instinct that that was there and I went deep to make sure and the answer is, it was So, I am feeling more excited than ever about. The long-term, and I stress that word long-term potential of what we can make out of that. This is going to be a case of one and one equals four, not even three in my opinion. But, don't anybody rush out and buy the stock, because I said Stratify was wonderful, that will be a very stupid thing to do in the short run, maybe not in the long run. Last thing, I want to talk about is because we had such technical difficulties on our last call, if some did listened the phones, I won't get into the details, but it was a mess and we believe we got ourselves repaired, at least we got certainly a DR plan this time that will work, if we have problems. But as I did announce last time that I had informed the Board and we had... the Board had decided that the right thing to do, according to our succession plan that we have been working on for sometime. It was time to me to change my role and to go the role of an Executive Chairman and to elevate Bob Brennan to the role of Chief Executive Officer. So, we are still on path and expect to do that at the Board meeting after annual shareholders meeting, where we all are standing for reelection and of course Bob is standing for the first time for election to the Board of Directors. Just to stress what my role will be as Executive Chairman, I chose carefully the title Chairman as I’ve told some of the employees, when I dropped the word Executive that means I might go learn to play golf, which would be a field exercise anyway. The reason I chose the term Executive Chairman is the implication that… is that I'm still working full time because that is what I am doing and expect to do and expect to continue doing so long as I am being useful and people want me to continue doing it. It was with right time and place I think in the company's history and from me personally to change my focus. I want to focus on… if you look at my legacy and I am not going talk a long time about my legacy, because I believe in a lot of those stuff. But, if you look back, it's pretty simple. I led the team that accumulated this company from… I started at $3 million and we are going to do over $3 billion this year. But, just take since we have been public, from about $100 million in revenue and over $3 billion. We have accumulated from being a single product line, single country, 20, 25 city operation to 38 countries and a broad product line across the physical and digital universe. I'm proud of what the organization has done and each of those businesses are doing fine. They are good businesses. The real upside, if you want to look it... and I keep citing Bob a little bit is to what his legacy will have to be. But, if you want to look to the future the real upside is making one and one equal four out of these businesses and the opportunity absolutely is there do that. So, we are not going to be opportunity bound, we are going to be execution bound and it's hard stuff, because the problems that we face may sound simple from the outside, but if you go talk to customers they are just scratching their heads of how to do it in a cost-effective manner and we understand how to do it. There are complex problems and right now most of the solutions out there are complex and expensive and our goal is to create a series of simple solutions to solve… all together to solve a complex problem. I'm going to put a lot of my time and energy in doing that, because I think that's where the greatest value enhancement I can have to helping our shareholders and helping our employees and the business. That's a better leverage on me than running business over the next time period. So, that's what I'm going to be spending most of my time doing of course, I'll remain a close advisor to Bob and as Chairman of the Board… member of the Board and operate at those levels too. It has been a good time for me and I'm not leaving. So, I am not going to give my swansong speech, if you ever hear it, it won't be today. Before I turn over to Brian, a brief summary, and one other thing I do want to use my license, this is my, I think, 49th conference call and not my last. But, it is probably my last one in which I'll lead it, which I’ll do most of the talking. But, from time-to-time, I've been known to lecture the market, so if you bare with me a little bit, I'll give you just a slight lecture. And I do it in your best interest, not necessary, in our best interest. The business is running well. It was running well last quarter and the quarter before that. The stock popped up and popped down, crazy volatility. It's not a volatile business. So, it probably tells me people didn't believe us. It's the only thing I can figure out. The business will vary quarter-to-quarter and I've read some headlines from Analyst Day and I appreciate the positive headlines, don't get me wrong, they are always better than negative headlines. You are talking about this being an inflection point. I just want you understand we don't run the business that way, we are running the business to meet our annual goals. We have given you the numbers. We are going to hit those numbers. There are no guarantees in life, but we are going to manage... we are going to do our best to manage the business to hit those numbers. We don't manage the business except for people's internal incentive plans and a lot of other reasons to hit specific quarterly numbers and we make judgments oftentimes and they go against specific quarterly numbers. But, go in the best interest of the annual numbers and the best interest, quite candidly, we make some that go against them in the best interest of the long-term of the business. And we are going to keep doing that and we will communicate those things as it is going. But, I just want to be careful that people don't grab a hold… this is a good quarter and I know people didn’t like the last quarter. I am telling you there are no differences, but regardless of that, I want to be careful that people don't grab it and draw a ruler or push a button on your spreadsheet and drive us straight to the roof. We think the business is going to do well and watch out. I personally believe it's going to be very tough economic environment. But, our business is changing and that makes it a little more… little different than past. Our new digital services, the service mix puts a slightly more volatility in it, puts a slight more pattern shift than in the past. Some of our businesses are weak in one quarter others are strong in different quarters. Those mixes are changing and so forth. But, net-net is, we are running the business for annual performance. We are of to a good start. We expect to do what we say we are going to do for the year. And it's still a very clear picture and I still love it. And we’ll look forward to taking your questions. Brian?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Richard. And good morning everybody. Q1 was a solid start to the year for Iron Mountain. We posted strong revenue and OIBDA gains with early year results ahead of our forecast. This reflects solid underlying business performance including better than expected results in certain aspects of our digital business combined with continued positive impacts from foreign exchange changes and high paper prices. We will begin today with the review of our Q1 results. I will also review our cash flow performance, capital spending trends and debt position through the first quarter and put these results in a context of our full year outlook. We will conclude with an update of our 2008 full-year guidance, which we've refined reflecting our solid early results. We will also share our outlook for the second quarter. Slide 4 highlights the key messages from today's review. Iron Mountain delivered strong financial results in Q1, with revenue up 18% and comparable OIBDA up 14%. We posted high revenue gains across all major business units, supported by 9% internal growth, the benefits of our major acquisitions, and favorable foreign currency movements. We also drove strong OIBDA growth in the quarter despite some dilutive impact from acquisitions completed last year and some carryover impacts from investments initiated in 2007. On a reported basis, OIBDA increased 12%. Included in OIBDA are net losses on asset write-downs of $3.5 million and $37,000 for Q1 2008 and Q1 2007 respectively. When excluding these losses from both years, comparable OIBDA grew 14%. As a result of our Q1 performance, we are refining our outlook for the full-year, raising the low end of our revenue and OIBDA forecast ranges. This reflects our confidence that we're on track towards achieving our full-year financial goals. Let’s move on to looking at the details on our performance on slide 5. Slide 5 compares results for this quarter to Q1 of 2007. Overall, we had another strong revenue quarter supported by a balanced growth across our key business units, which drove the overall increase of 18%. Our largest segment, North America Physical posted 13% growth overall. Internal revenue growth was 7%. We saw solid growth in our secure shredding business, with continued strength in recycled paper prices, which offset some softness in core service activity. Overall, growth continues to benefit from the ArchivesOne and RMS acquisitions. Our international Physical business was up 28% overall. Internal growth was 12%, driven by strength in Latin America and Asia-Pacific and solid performance in Europe. We continued to see strong gains from complementary service growth across our international business. International growth also benefited from selected acquisitions that are strengthening our global footprint and from favorable foreign exchange changes, which together added 16% to revenue gains. Finally, our digital segment drove better than expected revenue gains, supported by consistent growth in storage revenue and better than expected performance from our Stratify acquisition. Software license sales were also higher than expected, although still below the strong 2007 levels. Revenue gains helped drive a solid 19% year-on-year improvement in gross profit. Gross margins were up modestly for the quarter, compared to the same prior year period, supported by higher recycled paper prices. Growth in our digital service businesses, which have higher gross margins, also had a positive impact. These gains were partially offset by impacts from higher energy costs and business mix. SG&A growth was 23% in the quarter, compared to prior year levels. Higher rates of overhead growth were impacted by two primary factors. The first involves the integration of our recent technology acquisitions, including Stratify, which have a relatively higher overhead cost base as a percentage of revenues. Q1 SG&A growth also reflects carryover impacts from investments in security, international sales resources, and infrastructure initiated in 2007, as well as additional stock option expense related to higher than normal grant activity last year. The impact to these factors on cost growth will moderate later this year particularly in the fourth quarter, where we have more favorable comparisons. OIBDA was $176 million for the quarter, up 12%. As noted including OIBDA for Q1 2008 where net losses on the write-down of assets of $3.5 million. Loss on the building we spoke up on our last call was slightly less than the $3 million we forecasted, but we did have some assets write-down associated with the upgrade of our core inventory system. Adjusting for these losses, OIBDA growth was 14% and OIBDA margin was approximately 24% in Q1. Depreciation was $61 million and amortization was $8 million in the first quarter, as expected. Operating income was a $106 million for Q1 2008, up 7% versus the prior year as OIBDA gains were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization driven by 2007 capital spending and acquisitions. Slide 6, breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line, as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, which added about 7% and 3% respectively to our growth ranges for the first quarter. Internal revenue growth for the quarter was 9% in range of our full year growths. Internal growth was comprised of 8% storage growth and 10% service growth, reflecting continued benefits from expansion of less capital intensive more project based offerings. Core service growth moderated in Q1, impacted by a slow down in destruction revenues following strong growth in this front in Q3, Q4 of last year. Offsetting these effects was continued strong internal growth in complimentary services. We saw a solid project growth in international markets in Q1 and software license sales ran ahead of forecast. Growth of recycled paper revenues across geographies remained strong supported by continued higher recycled paper pricing. Keep in mind that complimentary service revenue, which represents about 15% of our overall revenues, can fluctuate over time, given changes in demand and timing for special project activity and variations and factors such as recycled paper pricing. As noted in our last call, we do expect growth in complimentary services to moderate as we work through this year due to the comparisons to some large European public sector projects that are either completed are winding down. Despite these anticipated impacts, we expect that our overall internal growth rates will remain solid through the year, we believe we are on track to deliver against our full year internal growth goals. Moving on with our review of Q1 P&L performance. Slide 7 bridges our Q1 operating income to net income and EPS results. Q1 results on these fronts were basically as expected. As discussed, operating income for the quarter was up 7% to a $106 million, as OIBDA gains were partially offset by year-on-year increases in depreciation and amortization. D&A grew 12 million versus prior levels in Q1 reflecting increased CapEx spending and the impacts of our 2007 acquisitions, most notably ArchivesOne and Stratify, which were completed after the end of Q1, 2007. Our Q1 interest expense increased compared to Q1 2007 as expected driven primarily by increase debt for our 2007 acquisitions. Other income was $6 million or about $0.02 per share in Q1, primarily reflecting gains related to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we mark our inter-company and third-party debt to market. In the first quarter of 2007, we reported other income of $8 million or $0.02 of share related primarily to insurance gains. Net income and EPS were $33 million and $0.16 per diluted share respectively, down moderately from 2007 levels, due primarily to lower operating profit, as I have discussed, including the $3.5 million of losses on asset write-downs and lower other income in the quarter. In Q1, our effective tax rate was 34.9%, slightly below the 36% tax rate we forecasted on our last call. The decrease was driven by the net tax impact of foreign currency gains and losses in different tax jurisdictions. We are now estimating our tax rate before discreet items for 2008 to be approximately 38%. The increase from the 36% we estimated on our last call is due to the tax impact of un-benefited net operating losses at some of our international startup businesses. After 2008, we expect our tax rate, excluding the impact of discreet items, to decrease over time to approximately 36%. Slide 8 summarizes our capital spending for the quarter, it highlights are year-to-date results compared to the full-year 2007 amounts and our current 2008 outlook, which we're reiterating today. Our Q1 2008 CapEx was $56 million including $4 million for real estate. Traditionally, the first quarter is the light CapEx quarter as some projects are scheduled for later in the year and many required time to plan and source before the significant expenditures are eventually made. We are currently spending to our plan and expect to finish the year within the forecasted range. Consistent with our long-term financial goals, we are focused on improving our overall capital efficiency by reducing CapEx spend as a percentage of revenues. Some of this efficiency is related to business mix as we continue to see strong growth in our new services, which are less capital intensive than our core physical business. The capital efficiency we gain through this mix shift offsets the relatively lower margin characteristics of these services resulting in attractive incremental returns on investment. Lets now move on to slide 9 and look at free cash flow for the quarter. Slide 9 highlights our year-to-date cash flow performance compared to the same period in 2007. For Q1 2008, free cash flow was negative $20 million before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate. The year-on-year decrease in cash flow reflects the payment in Q1 2008 of been unusually large 2007 year-end CapEx balance of $60 million and a $45 million increase in working capital usage. The working capital increase was due primarily to increased accounts receivable driven by increased sales as well as the timing of normal payroll and AT cycles, which led to lower accruals and payables. Keep in mind that free cash flow is best looked at on a full-year basis as the timing of certain cash events is not consistent throughout the year. For example, the first quarter, historically our lowest cash flow quarter, was impacted by the 2007 CapEx accrual and the payment of our annual bonuses. For 2008, we continue to expect free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to be approximately $25 million to $75 million. As noted in our last call, 2008 free cash flow is impacted by the 2007 CapEx accrual I just spoke of being paid in Q1. Now let's turn to slide 10 to review our debt statistics. In terms of our debt portfolio, we ended Q1 2008 in a position very similar to year-end as you can see on this slide. Our weighted average interest rate is down to 7.1% and we are 75% fixed. Consolidated leverage decreased to 4.4 times within our target range of 4 to 5 times OIBDA. Maturity is now at 7.1 years, with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2012. Our liquidity also remains strong. As of March 31, we had more than $450 million of cash availability under our revolving credit facility. Now let's move ahead to slide 11 to discuss our revised 2008 financial guidance. Turing to slide 12, based on our solid start to the year, we are refining our full year guidance, raising the low end of our target ranges for revenue and OIBDA. Our full year revenue outlook is now $3.015 billion to $3.080 billion, and we are now targeting full year operating income of $474 million to $499 million. Note that the operating income outlook includes impacts from the slightly higher than excepted losses on assets write-downs recorded in Q1. This would imply an OIBDA range of $766 million to $791 million for the year or growth of 10% to 14% on a comparable basis, excluding gains and losses on assets write-downs. We are maintaining our full year CapEx forecast of $440 million to $480 million. At mid-point performance, this would equate to a modest reduction in capitals spending as a percent of sales in 2008 building on our 2007 progress. Our expectations for Q2 performance are shown here as well, which implies revenue growth of 12% to 15% and 8% to 13% comparable OIBDA growth. We will continue to work through higher levels of cost growth in Q2 similar to Q1 driven by acquisition integration and carryover cost impacts from investments initiated in 2007. As noted, we expect these impacts to moderate later this year consistent with our full-year plans. So, in summary, we are of to a solid start. We are driving solid growth across our business, and we are confident that we are on track to deliver against our full-year financial objectives. Thanks and we will now open the phones to take your questions. Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: National opportunity, do you see multinational corporations as wanting to consolidate their business globally towards Iron Mountain, or is it more they view on a country by country basis, how should we think about that?
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: A lot of ways, the answer is, there is no one answer. It depends on the company, industry and a lot of things. But, there is overall trend of wanting to consolidate... a variety of trends. One is to have fewer vendors period. Two, is to drive more purchasing leverage through doing that. The third thing is, as though, for compliance reasons, having fewer vendors makes it cheaper and easier to manage. Consistency at what you do on a global basis is coming more and more important. Having said that, all of that, you got to earn it locally. There is no... there are very few companies... there are more and more than it used to be that would make a true globalization, but the more... the general trend is to make more regional decisions under some consistent umbrella and so that's why we are trying to become strong in each of the major regions.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Okay. That's helpful. Could you elaborate on the destruction variability from quarter-to-quarter? Is that something that's predictable as in there are seasonal factors or is it less predictable and we are not going to really be able to accurately model how that ebbs and flows?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: There is some variation and that is obviously driven… we have some advanced insight into that, but it's…
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: A lot of it is... there is… like a lot of things, there is lot of complex trends, but by and large, there is base line amount of that activity that sort of happens like clock work. And then what happens is and it doesn't take many very large customers to either do catch-up, that is, they’ll have to put a lot of stuff on hold, because of their retention programs, and we've seen this trend not very well managed. They are afraid of the litigation and the compliance issues of doing that, then they build a program, oftentimes we help them to do, and then they do a big catch-up, maybe two or three years backwards and it doesn't take... two or three of them do that in a quarter to make it rise. You also, by the way, sometimes see… I've seen this pattern before and I'm not... I don't know for fact that we are seeing this yet. But, I have seen this pattern where in tough times people stop destroying because they would rather pay the monthly storage price and just budget here, than the one-time fee to get rid of the box. They are protecting those...
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And possible we may have seen some of that impact in Q1. I think in a full year basis we have a pretty good handle on that, but we again do see some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Okay that makes sense. And then just one last question. Could you comment on increased energy cost and how you are passing that along to customers and whether impacts the business at all?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: The energy costs are about 2% to 3% of our revenues and that's split pretty evenly between basically cost that flow through our facilities... energy for facilities, lighting, etcetera, and the other half is related to transportation. It is somewhat higher than that in the first quarter because we are… just the seasonality nature of our business. A significant number of our customers, we have fuel surcharge arrangements for the transportation fees, so that's something that we can't pass on. But, we did see some negative impact in our margins in Q1 that was an offsetting factor that...
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: In the short run, it's like a lot of businesses. The real variable stuff like and the rolling stock, we've been working over the last 18 months or so to put in our contracts and agreements, fuel surcharges. We are not a 100% there with all customers, but we are on a path to get there. So, we will have fluctuations and [inaudible] we can deal with it. But, the other piece coming through heat and light and facilities, you can’t index that so easily that shows up in price increases later. So, in the near term, we eat it and in the long-term, we’d expect to get it back.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with Bear Stearns.
Andrew Steinerman - Bear Stearns: Hi, I am going to take debate on Richard's comments that quarter-to-quarter margins could be volatile. Just to kind of have clarity on this. When we look at the margins in the first quarter excluding the $4 million write-off, it would seem like the first quarter would be the low quarter for the year to make the overall margin goals that are implied in the middle of the guidance. I will also note, as you guys… historically out, that the first quarter of the year is usually the lowest quarter of the year on margin. So, when Richard called out volatility, did you mean that we could expect unusual volatility or normal volatility?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: You're right on both points in terms of the implications for margins. The first quarter is historically our lowest margin quarter and part of that is driven by the energy cost we just spoke of. Our guidance would imply that we're going to have better and improving margins as we work through the year, both in terms of quarter-to-quarter and also on a year-on-year basis. There are two drivers to that. One is, we're expecting moderation in the cost growth later this year, Andrew, I just want to highlight it's probably going to be a bit more in Q4 than it is in Q2 and Q3, but we are expecting some improvement on that front. We are continuing to target improvement in gross margins driven in part by real estate efficiencies. So, we wouldn't read anything to Richard's comments signaling that we're expecting volatility this year quarter-to-quarter, just trying to highlight that margins do vary on a quarter-to-quarter basis and we are focused on delivering our full-year goals and we are going to manage that way.
Andrew Steinerman - Bear Stearns: That's great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Gold with Sidoti.
David Gold - Sidoti: Hi, good morning.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Dave.
David Gold - Sidoti: A couple of clarifications or follow-up questions. One the comment… I mean the release, international special project revenue helping in the first quarter. Are those the same projects that you commented on that you are pointing to in fourth and first quarter that are running off as we speak a little bit?
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Our commentary was talking actually about overall international complementary service growth, which includes Latin America and Asia-Pacific, which did quite well on that front in the first quarter. We did see growth in Europe as well and that is continuing to benefit from a project that we're expecting to wind down relatively… I think right after the first half of this year. We tried to highlight last year that they were two European projects that year-on-year we are going to lose about $25 million in annualized record… $25 million in revenue year-on-year and that is going to be a factor that is going to contribute to moderation. Our expectation, we are going to see lower levels of complementary service growth in the back half.
David Gold - Sidoti: Got you. Okay. It's helpful. And then one other question, if you can comment or give a little bit more color on paper prices, have been strong year-to-year… if you can just remind us where we were a year ago versus this year?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: In the first quarter of last year, we had paper prices in the range of about $150 per ton and right now we're in the $225 to $230 range and so that… we will start to see the… paper prices really ramped up post Q1 last year and they have kind of moderated in terms of their increases. They're a bit better than we thought they were when we were on our last quality, but we will see less growth than benefit from that if they hold at current levels as we work through the year.
David Gold - Sidoti: Perfect, thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michel Morin with Merrill Lynch.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Yes, good morning. I am Michel Morin at Merrill Lynch. I think you alluded to some real estate efficiencies that might help the gross margin a little bit later on, are you referring to winding down the real estate rationalization project that’s in Pickferd [ph] or is that all behind us already?
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think we are referring just to broad base. Last year, we went long on some space and that hit our margin and we are absorbing it, we are taking fewer buildings this year for upping our capacity utilization and it’s flow through the year. You will that from time-to-time that same trend by the way. Some of it's opportunistic, some of it just, when you get the right circumstance, you take it. But, we work pretty long in a couple areas. The beauty of our business is, if you go long, it's just how fast you take to get utilization up. We are getting up just fine.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then specific to the Pickferd’s rationalization project, is that behind you now?
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We are still working through that in the UK. I know the big pieces, I think are behind us in some of the real-estate. The other thing we did in Australia is we chose to make that up a central management hub for accounting, consolidation and overhead staff for Asia-Pacific because of the small nature of a lot of the investments we are making there, so that, we added extra cost down there relative to the size of the business. So, that part, we haven't gone through yet, but the real state side, I think, is pretty much behind us.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. That is helpful. On the SG&A side, you mentioned the number of items. I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on kind of what you have been doing and when you would expect to complete these projects? I think you specifically talked about building up the sales capability in continental Europe, I was wondering when that started and what's the time line of that is?
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't want to say never, but the answer is, we have a long list of projects and things to invest in that can improve our business. So, whatever runs off through the rest of this year, I am sure will come up with another list for the next year. But, we’ll mange it within the context that we have said and that is, we are investing for growth in the business because of the opportunity. We are also committed to improving our operating results on a year-over-year basis as we go. So, we have a long list to pick and choose from. Those we pick and choose from the list, we factor all that in, and choose some.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: All right that's fine. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Thanks, good morning. You have alluded in the past to some softness in the UK, I believe you wanted to make some improvements there. Please give a quick update on how you feel that’s progressing?
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I think we have doing well. We have made some management changes internally and externally over the last let’s say 18 so much. We feel like our sales forces are doing pretty well right now over there, particularly in the UK. We are driving better control systems and processes that our margins… just a variety of things like that, we are making to get headway there.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: I think our business is on plan as we are working through this year and we saw some constrain on growth from the increased destructions and terminations that Richard talked about last year. So, the overall growth rates have been below where we like it to be longer return, but I think we are on track.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But, all the right trends in place to make that step happen. What really drags the UK businesses is this public service business, which is the project that you hear us talking about. Just to give you a sense, its a different business, it came along, it’s a related business, but it has different financial characteristics. Although we do some of the same work even for governments, but primarily for private sectors around the world, this just happens to be relatively large and it's a kind of business you win a government contract to manage their information and records, the trend seems to be that on the contract you make a fair return, and then they... when they have budget money, they call you up and spend it, and when they don't, they don't. And it seems like the way they budget over there is they give them a lot one year and take it away the next. So, you have a good year, bad year, good year, bad year. The truth is they are all good business, and we reluctant to throw out good businesses who make good money and have good returns on capital, and it is one of them. So, sorry, we will have to keep finding probably.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Brian indeed, just kind of following up on an earlier question on this government contract that's moving on through the year. I think you guys just said that it should continue until the middle of the year, is that a little bit longer tail than you had previously expected?
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I am sorry if there is confusion on this. Last year, we highlighted we had two contracts contributed about $25 million in revenue to our results last year. One is done, and the other one is going to be completed on about the same timetable that we had anticipated. So, when we talked about this, we didn't get into specific quarterly impacts. It’s something when we put out our guidance for the full year of complementary growth of 2% to 10% that was a key factor and are thinking of whether that number was going to be down a bit year-on-year. So, we wanted to make sure to highlight that.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks. Shifting gears a bit. I am pretty excited about the Stratify acquisition and how that's progressing there. Could you speak a little bit to, one, the competitive and pricing environment in that space, and then two, will there be additional acquisitions that you will need to make to kind of pad what you have there? Just a little bit of color on each.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: To answer your second one, never say never on anything. But, I don't see on the horizon the need to acquire in this space unless we find some really Wizbank [ph] something that we are missing. But, right now, we've got, in our opinion, the best Wizbank out there. In terms of pricing, it is a space you can get all kinds of prices quoted and different customers buy on different basis. But, our value proposition is to use technology to change the whole way that you run the process and in fact what you wind up doing is you reduce the legal review time, which is where all the real money is. We can reduce it substantially. We can save you 40% to 50% of the entire review cost and you may pay us more than you'd pay another technology provider who does simple things for you and then you pay your lawyers twice as much money if you would. But, net-net, if you look at the total cost, we are just dramatically cheap, it’s not price issue, it’s just making sure you understand what your cost are. Even better than that, the way we get at the information, the way we organize it, and the way we accomplish these things is that we also get deeper into the information and we know more about your data than you can find out otherwise using standard ways of looking at it. And that sometimes is between winning and losing. And that's big money. So, it's super stuff.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks. And one final one, if I could. Back at the Investor Day, some discussion of maybe changes in perhaps kind of foreshadowing there could be dividends, share repurchase pending, just could you update us on that front?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: I guess I made a mistake, [inaudible] made in my life that to even talk about it... let me be clearly, so everybody on the call knows, what you are talking about. At Investor Day, I made this statement intentionally, but I made this statement that I had always told shareholders who have asked me over and over, when you are going to think about dividends and share repurchases and so forth. And always... my answer has always been is, I don't know. We are not thinking about it, because we aren’t anywhere close to even think about, but when we do, I will tell you. And the truth is, we have started to think about it. We look at the models. You look at the models. We know what the future looks like. And we know how to run the business in a levered model and we know that means no matter what we do, we are going to have a lot excess capital. Okay. So, what I said at Investor Day is, I am meeting my promise to you basically. I have started to think about it… we have started to think about it. We don't give these kind of things light thought, it's going to take us a while]. And no hurry, so, I am not trying to put a timeframe on it. But, I am telling it's close enough in my mind. This kind of things takes thought because you don't do things like start dividends willy-nilly because you turn then on, you can’t turn them off. There is a lot of ways to think about how to create shareholder volume and stock buybacks. Net-net of it is, I fully expect we will return cap, cash to shareholders in due course and we will try to do it an intelligent fashion that benefits our shareholders in the maximum profitable way. I am not going to go through all the things I have thought about, but we are working on it. Timeframe I wouldn't begin to give you a timeframe.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Yes, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Franco Turrinelli with William Blair.
Franco Turrinelli - William Blair: Good morning, Richard.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: How are you?
Franco Turrinelli - William Blair: I guess, sort of similar questions to one that was placed earlier. I'm trying to understand that do you think about your services build-out, if you want to call it that way. If the plan would be to focus on the current areas of competence [inaudible] same kind of land grab that we’ve seen do in the traditional physical business or if you are really seeing more of an expansion of services has being part of the future?
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Maybe it’s the third time I’ve said never say never in this call. But, the focus right now, Franco, is just as I have said before, we have accumulated a lot in these businesses we have, knowledge, skill and opportunity. So, the real focus is getting that to work together in the right ways. That doesn’t mean we will not find other opportunities to acquire, other opportunities to expand around the edges, or fill in low pieces here and there, but we have really set the table pretty well. It’s now about getting it all to work together and extracting the majorities of the value add of it. It's not a strategy of, let's just go out and buy, buy, buy, I am not really out to acquisitions, they are always part of our kit, our tool set. Okay. But it is a strategy, we have accumulated a lot. It is the strategy of building and making the stuff work together and you will get it in the market in the right timeframe, you can easily be ahead of our market or behind the market and those are the kind of things that I worry a lot about. You are right up the [inaudible] I am really already starting to focus lot of my time to do and what I plan to do personally a lot more. Okay.
Franco Turrinelli - William Blair: Sure. That's helpful. This February, I was kind of looking back, the last time we talked about destruction was with a total of '03, which is an interesting reflection given what's happened since then.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Franco Turrinelli - William Blair: Thanks, Richard.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward Atorino with Benchmark.
Edward Atorino - Benchmark: Three questions. One on to Stratify, I understand that category has been growing about 30%, 35% in sort of the eDiscovery area, would you care to sort of talk about what Stratify has done against that kind of bogie? Second, SG&A expenses are almost 30% of revenues, I think that's is an all time high Richard. Is this sort of a new norm because of the change in mix and is there a long-term target? I thought one path to higher margin was to leverage higher revenues without higher SG&A. Could you talk about that a second? And then lastly what is sort of traditional box business doing? I know you talk about physical stuff, but what was the growth in the good old-fashioned box business and what percent of revenues is it now?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Let me try and take this on. In terms of the stratify growth, I think the growth ranges that you talked about are inline with what we are hoping to achieve in the business this year. So, I can't comment specifically on the market growth, but that's the kind of growth that we are hoping for on that front. In terms of SG&A spending, we've seen increases in SG&A as a percentage of revenue and part of that's driven by some changes in our business mix overtime and as Richard highlighted some of the acquired businesses particularly in the technologies space have relatively higher overhead base, also have higher gross margins in many cases and as we build our full year goals and what we are trying to achieve, we factor those type of dynamics... mixed dynamics into what we are looking to achieve. So, I think we are comfortable, we are on track for our full year goals and are on track towards our longer-term goals and that factors in potential changes in business mix over time.
Edward Atorino - Benchmark: So, this is sort of the “new norm”?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: I don't know how would you define the norm, but I think...
Edward Atorino - Benchmark: It’s 9.7%.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: I think our goals are to deliver good OIBDA performance relative to our revenue growth and we will balance and trade off impacts from business mix and gross margin and SG&A. Just in terms of the storage business, our global physical storage business was within our target range. It was at the lower end of target range at 7% to 9% and some of that's impacted by the high level destructions we saw late last year just falling over, but we are within our expected range for this year.
Edward Atorino - Benchmark: And what's the box business as a percent to total revenue now, US?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Box is roughly half.
Edward Atorino - Benchmark: Half? It’s the same overseas?
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The overseas would be more skewed towards the box business. I don’t have the precise number, but...
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: It varies by region.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It varies by region, but yet you have skew to that.
Edward Atorino - Benchmark: Thanks.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I am going to try to meet my commitment to keeping the call to an hour and we are about a minute over that. So, we will take one more question and then we will wrap up.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Andrea Hirth with Robert Baird.
Andrea Hirth - Robert Baird: Good morning.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Good morning Andrea.
Andrea Hirth - Robert Baird: First just wondering on the international business. Does that business still grow in the double-digits, if you exclude special projects and acquisitions?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: We are just checking right now, but...
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Let us do a little math…
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: The internal growth was 12%. It would be close to that level, I think, excluded the complementary.
Andrea Hirth - Robert Baird: Okay. In terms of special projects, was there anything meaningful in new ways [ph] booked this quarter as far as special projects go?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Unless they were just huge, we don't have the visibility, it's so broadly dispersed across geography and customer bases to really know that on a cumulative basis. We know when you line up super, super giants.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Nothing that we are highlighting.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: I think that we would know of is that way.
Andrea Hirth - Robert Baird: Okay. And then just want to look at pricing little bit, what was the contribution of pricing in the quarter?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: We are making progress in storage pricing in North America and we were up. We did a little north of the 1% range last year and this year we are hoping to move it two percent plus and we feel we are on the right track on that front.
Andrea Hirth - Robert Baird: Okay. So, you still believe that you can get closer to 2% or above this year?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: We are making progress.
Andrea Hirth - Robert Baird: Okay. And then just last question. This is in terms of the banks and financial institutions and all the turmoil they are experiencing. What has been the impact of that on your business and has it been meaningful yet or do you think that's still something that... maybe there will be lag effect and you will eventually see some more impact on that?
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: We haven't seen anything yet, most of our customers and as one [inaudible], it's more of an impact of working hard to integrate the programs and rationalize them and so forth. Yes, I think we'll see some more of that happening in time. But, the good news about our business is, even if some of them were to be in serious trouble, they still have to keep their records around. And typically they will get... they get litigated for years after that. We still I believe have the records for Directional Burn [ph] if I remember correctly, which we are paid for in advance a long time ago. So, I don't think we will see dramatic impact. I will tell you, we'll leverage model, we watch the capital market carefully, we have tremendous bank syndicates that we appreciate a lot and how your markets have been good to us. But, we always will do... we will watch those market carefully just to make sure that we have continued access to capital and play conservative as we go into what I believe personally will be some pretty tough times for companies. We won't get out of an economy un-scaled, nobody ever does. But I'd rather be here than in most companies I know of, looking what I think is going to happen over the next two or three year. So, obviously I am fairly gloomy about the outlook.
Andrea Hirth - Robert Baird: That's helpful. Great. Thanks. Nice quarter.
Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Stephen P. Golden - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you very much. We appreciate it and it’s a little over an hour. So, let me get on. Not a lot of summary except to just remind you it was a good quarter, but don't get too excited. We going to hit our year, so think about it from that perspective and hopefully you are hearing the message, we are trying to get you worrying about quarters and so on, because we are not running the business that way, and you spend a lot of time and energy worrying about stuff that don't need to be worried about. Trends are trends. But, in our business, they take a long time to unfold. You couldn't see it one quarter if you try it. Every time we tried, we've been wrong. Hopefully, you have gotten that message and then you gotten the message, we feel pretty good about our business and we are on track for the year. Just to remind those of you, Jeff and Steven will be at Merrill Lynch conference May 14 in New York City and Bob, Brain, and Steven and I will be at the William Blair Conference on June 18 in Chicago. So, we look forward to seeing many of you out there. Again, thank you for your time, your patience, and I appreciate you tolerating me for the 49th consecutive conference call and you are not over listening to me yet, but it's probably the last time I'll be dragging so long. So, have a very good day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2007 Q4  (2008-03-04 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Robert Brennan - Chief Executing Officer C. Richard Reese - Chairman and CEO Bob Brennan - President and COO
Analysts: David Gold - Sidoti & Company, LLIRM Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch Andrew Steinerman - Bear, Stearns & Company Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.
Operator: Mr. Golden you may proceed. Mr. Golden you may proceed. [Technical Difficulty] For this is colleagues, we are focused on the year of 2007 rather than the quarter, Brian will give in-depth details, both on the year and quarter. But I thought I will review for you and just try to put some things in context and after Brian goes through the details, I will come back and have a few personal comments on the announcement we made about the shifts and the roles within the company. So let's get started and talk about the year. As you know, hopefully you've seen the press releases and you will see that 2007 was a strong year for us, both in revenue and overall [ph] growth. Revenue were up 16% and that was driven by our internal growth at 10% at the top engine of our forecasted range, plus a very strong acquisition year, which I will comment more about a little later. In addition to that we had strong service growth revenue at 12% internal growth. And that was a combination, as it has been often a lately a strong complementary services in the project space, as well as of course increasing recycled paper prices from our shredding business. But the company serviced, I want to remind you does swing around, it typically represents about 13% of our revenue mix historically and it can move up and down, you will see reflected in our guidance for 2008, a little slower complementary service year that is primarily driven off high comps we are coming over and again we'll give you those details. We're not sending any signals about the business relative to the counting year performance, I think the message you should read in our guidance and what we are today this business is performing well and this business is usual going into '08 is the way we see it right now. OIBDA growth was 15% for the year excludes one time gains. It's the good year of operations. We completed about 20... not above 20 acquisitions or 20 deals and nearly $0.5 billion, this is a very high year for us in acquisition spend and I do not believe that we will that amount of money in '08. We don't see that in our pipeline or in our thoughts in any form or fashion. Time will tell, but we don't see that coming. We did make some positive strides capital efficiency in the business, which is one of our long term goals and CapEx efficiency that is capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue was increased from 15.2% or decrease to... excuse me went from 15.8 in '06 to 15.2 in '07. So we are making on all fronts frankly in the business. Our balance sheet remains strong. We put in this year a global treasury program, which gave us some increased flexibility and how we borrow money and where we move it around as well as what our total lending cost. We also exercised in as you know of a bad credit market our $300 million Cordian [ph] feature of our senior credit line in November and virtually same terms that we had refinanced in last April. That leaves us in a very good position. We have about a little under $0.5 billion dollars of availability under our capacity for launch and those significant debt maturities in 2012. So our balance sheet is strong as you know and I will remind everybody we do want to leverage business. We would intend to maintain the elaborate business and it is all about managing frequent leverage currently that is our leverage ratio is all and it's about 4.5 times, that's total debit, debt to OIBDA. So, we're well positioned to fund our strategies, as we see the opportunities we drive are generally going forward. So, Iron Mountain is in a good position. We had a great year financially and we are really positioned for good year here in 2008. But we did a lot more than just made the bottom-line. As we told you on Investor Day, we're committed to some long term growth revenue and OIBDA growth metrics which will repeat over and over. We operate within those range, we will expect operating in those range in year-in year-out, that doesn't mean quarter-end and quarter-out, but year-in and year-out we'd expect to do that, but we also expect to continue to build our business strategically and I'm very pleased by the results in terms of strategic development throughout the year. So let me go through some of that to give you a sense of how business has changed in past [ph]. So many of that, we hardly speak and it followed the company for long time that you've till I have drawn down for not blowing the phase about a three phase strategy. I'm sure many of you can repeat it better backend and I'm not going to repeat it in depth right now. Except to tell you that and to remind those, the first phase we used acquisitions to build products in markets, the second phase, we built a world class selling organization that's a envy of many to go out and sell new products or sell to those customers and penetrate them and of course we talked a link for some years about moving in the capitalization phase and I can say with that exception, except well without, except for minor exceptions places like China and parts of Asia, we're in the capitalization phase, pretty much everywhere in the world and what that means is really a different approach to business where we maximize on our core businesses and that's penetration, as well as efficiency that and driving into where we spend our money, how we invest our money? It's driving deeper in the customers, as well as driving efficiency in our operations and then of course the global expansion taken that core opportunity to expand our global footprint. We are a... we have a ball [ph] footprint of about 38 countries around the globe and we continue to be some strategic and some opportunistic, as how we enter countries around the globe, but truly we are getting down to the short list now. As I said China before, we've got small footprints in four cities, we'll continue add footprints. But right now they are not costing us a lot of money; it's a long line laying [ph] a long line for the future. It will be a tremendous in the long-term, but our opportunity set in here right now is right front of this and doing well. Our opportunity to set in other parts of the world and still in Europe it is doing well for us. So we feel good about what we've done there. In this other phase, in addition to capitalizing in this last phase of capitalization phase and difference to maximize in the core and expanding on the core. It is about now new services laying out the lines for the long-term, as you know we started an additional business which is one of our main new services, like it is our main new service and for the reason we call all that out a separate line of business. But I should remind you we have other new services that are doing very well for us, our shredding business is rocking and rolling, our DMS business is rocking and rolling. So we laid out lots of opportunities there and they are all starting [indiscernible] in this force. Of course our additional business maintains leadership in the software as the service; in this case storages service business. A model that we feel very good about, a model that is attracting more competitors which is validating the investments we have been making a long time. There is a reason why they are coming in, it's because it's a great market opportunity and we are pleased that we've started early, we've learned a lot and we are doing well there. So lets talk a bit about that maximizing the core that said, solid leadership in North American Physical 13% revenue in OIBDA growth while integrating 10 acquisitions and that's sounds easy given that to those track [ph] that we've done 20 or so year a long time, but one of those 10 was ArchivesOne. ArchivesOne, was the largest independent records management company left outside of Iron Mountain and that was an overlap 17 cities. The work required to deliver the margins that we did and deliver revenue growth we did and to integrate 17 cities open this, it did a great job. Also, we had several new entrants, well I can speak about the market it is we see in the North American market there are several entrants coming in. There is a second round of roll ups coming. Is at least four groups of large capital that we've taken around and trying to roll up the business, which we think is a good thing frankly flush out some more opportunities there are not though any large targets, but they are places we will continue to invest money. We remain a buyer, we will continue to invest where we see good returns and in many cases we have we have the upper hand in the transaction, the ability to integrate, the ability to draw [ph] core value. And in some cases we don't and we so we are going to be prudent and smart about how we invest money, but we're open for business in North America and we will make sure that market out there hears and understands that. Internal growth in North America is still solid at 9%, it's all across the board, we did really well shredding though really helped drive us and they were 19% in the quarter at their modest start in the year is that business as we said is doing well. In fact we have our shredding business that we have not been in we are now starting into our eight year in this business and it's a well a lot now is about a $250 million and it has grown very well on us and very attractive margins and good returns. We also have made significant investments in and investing where the market is moving in our core physical businesses, that's about security and chain of custody, back in 2007 we invested about $46 million of capital investment and about $5 million to the OpEx, improving the quality of what we do for customers and really stepping up the gap between us and the competition. This includes things like system modernization which is an ongoing process. It'll take some time, more transportation and productivity of engineering initiatives and so forth. It improves quality of our service, it improves quality of our security and a good part of that went in to security is our in new control transportation platform which heads us some competitive advantages over anybody out there. So all in all, North America is doing a great job. They are not only maintaining good growth, good margin, they are enhancing improving their business and they are digging deeper and deeper and frankly we got a long way to go where there is lots of opportunities in that business, both on the growth side as well as the margin side. On the footprints expansion globally, it continues to work our international business, it grew 25% on an internal growth rate of 12 Latin America and Asia Pac both did well. They're smaller businesses, although Latin America under our own eyes, it's has grown up to be a beautiful business and they're just doing a super job down there. And we continue to expand our presence in Continental Europe and we are not finished in Europe, but we are pretty much finished. There're still a few cities that it will make sense for us get into there. In addition to that it is not just about footprint, it's about building out management team, it's about building out people who can take that footprint and take it back to strategy of maximizing on the core. This would create and add to the core than you have to maximize in the core, so it's the cycle we have to go through. We've made tremendous progress in that space and we like what we see going on in there. We have some challenges, it's not like the world is perfect and rosy, if it were, life would be too simple and other people would be doing this but, we have some select challenges and particularly in the UK, they had great results, but the storage growth rate is not where we like them to be. That's some related to increased destructions and withdrawals. Part of that is outside of our control, and a normal phenomenon, one we've seen in the U.S., and that is some of our large financial services, our companies and banks and so forth, go for a while of not doing any destructions and then as they have put in place the compliance regime to really respond to the new world that they have to operate in, then they go back and do catch up. By the way, that's a... just so you understand, it's not only a normal thing, it's a thing we sell services, encourage people how to do that. We have a consulting practice to repeat them, in certain we stimulated a lot of this, so its not something that we worry about, its... in fact something we make money on every step of the way, both on the consulting side as well as it allows us to churn our asset base a little better, it's one of the things that will contribute to the increase on return on assets and so forth. Volume growth continues to do well there, but it's not what we wanted it to be at this stage and we think we can make it work. Looking forward to box growth rate, in the UK is about 5% and that paper storage is about 9%. All in all, we think we've got some upside there that we can work on. We entered 11 new countries, I would say this year, and so we really did do a lot of footprint work, I know you've heard about them, but just to review on them, does well on a good number in Southeast Asia through it's joint venture over there, to a joint venture we went into Russia, we started in Moscow, we announced Moscow and St. Petersburg, when you... by the way just a comment and this is just a stupid American talking or I would say the angered American talking, but when you look at some of those markets, when you look at cities in Russia and cities in China, that stupid American does not even know the name and you start looking at the market opportunity dynamics, it blows your mind. The upside opportunity of laying these long lines, over the long term is going to phenomenal. It just blows me away of what I see over there and what I see in opportunity now. That's not going to happen in 2008, let's just be careful. We lay in long liens, the good news is to the joint ventures, structure we're not investing significant capital. We're able to lay long lines and we're going to be there as that market involves and be able to take advantage of it. Other markets entered Denmark, Turkey, these came through joint ventures and then of course acquisitions, some additional fold-ins in work in the UK, Italy, France, Ireland and the Netherlands increasing our presence and just building more scale in some of those markets. And as you know scale in Europe is one of the issues we've been working on scale drives efficiency, efficiency drives margin and so forth and so on and both through internal growth which is strong in Continental Europe as well as do an additional tuck-in acquisitions. We're kind of investing to drive our returns up and make these even better businesses on the continent out there. So far this year, we've done a one shredding in a transaction of Australia, as we expand our footprint in that business. We to date, we brought shredding in all of North America, some parts of South America, Australia, New Zealand and the UK and we will continue to look for a, on a targeted basis just as select market opportunities where it makes sense to enter. It's not a business that will necessarily make sense in every part of the world, because different parts of the world have a different perspective on the value of their information and where pay [ph] to have shredded in that. But where there is a value of recognition and we see the opportunity, we will make that happen. So lot of work done and we are very pleased about what we see there, some work left to be done, but not big in footprint, but more now into maximizing on this businesses as we go. Let me talk about the biggest new service offering that we have been working on some years as we wanted people, just want to focus on them and I'm sure is an additional business. That segment had very good year revenue up 17%, of the nearly doubled. It is free cash flow positive as a business. So it's already generating a slight amount of excess cash flow in above what we are reinvesting back into it. I'm not sure that I'll always be able to say in terms of what we invested in it year-after-year, but it will get increased and more positive [ph]. So this is a good strong business. We've got some leadership and have some attractive targeted segments and are stressed to concept the targeted segments to remind those, we have storage as a service play, but we are not covering, we are not trying to do everything, we are not all things to all people. We are sticking to what we know which is back up of our cash flow and that's something we have in position, a leadership, a brand and expertise and we have an enormous amount of intellectual property with a significant number of patterns in that space and we intend to leverage that intellectual property and knowledge. As we go forward that will give us some advantages that business. Our both... both our business, well I think if you look at all that businesses, there is three of them in it, there is intellectual property management business, there is the digital archive and there is the backup business. Backup still seems as the one that leads the path. There archive business, we are making good progress and starting to commercialize we are not there yet. Some of our new technologies, but our old technology base continues to grow significantly and we have made great progress to reviews in the cost of operations on that. So we are pleased with the progress we are doing there. We have driven scale in the business which was many of you remember was my goal. I have said many times this will be a large market. It will attract large number of competitors but the key is getting to scale. Because once you get to scale you can be you can be profitable; we've reached scale, we've reached the profitability and we can see ways to enhance our profitability. We have strengthen the team in particularly we've added some key people of technology space, and new Chief Technology Officer was a very experienced gentlemen. We had a real track record of building technology companies and we did a significant acquisition in our additional space last year with a company, is Stratify. I could talk for hours but I won't, about what I believe is the upside is the real value, we got with Stratify but net it all out it intellectual property is a team of very strong people lead by Rominav [ph] and Kara and a lot other people I won't name because it will take me hours. A very strong footprint of both the technology as well as profit management both in the U.S. and in India. The ability to work 7 by 24 to solve customer problems, where we have increased the speed and reduced the cost and complexity of the rediscovery which we did for our customers is one of there largest problems painful and they are going to face till date. So we are very excited about the earnings and great to have them on our team. Other new services when I talked about sometime get lost and while I am here to Stratify which is the eDiscovery which attrition our additional space it, absorbs, our total eDiscovery services. We are probably the only vender that can start restoring your information about physical and additional in fact and then make sure that in a total unbroken chain are crusted that information is prepared for and discovered with some of the best technology on the planet to do that annually, your cost value do it. So, we can put that together with our Physical business eDiscovery is the combination of integrating digital and Physical information and bring it to bound our system for lawyers can work with it. And we are pretty excited about that. Other things we've done during the year is we brought a small technology company call Accutrac, that brings us some technology in the records message place frankly will help us avoid some investment we would have done ourselves and we are busy about integrating that in our platform and expanding on it. We will invest more into and make it a core part of our service offering. Net, what it does is gives us a greater tool chess to solving customer problems that links from tied our in with us in the records management space and we will build after that and embed a lot more of our expertise and uses of vehicle to be able to charge for expertise to get paid for that expertise, not just to give it a way as part of our services and so forth. We also give it a transaction in the medical space, health care as one of our strongest verticals where we have the leadership but we bought out a company by the name of RMS who has a very unique product model, business model that was as encashment of our service offering. We saw what they were doing we thought it was creative. We copied it, we liked it, then we order. It's just that simple. And in that we got a great team of people they don't have this, they have a solution here we are going in great detail that really gets deeper into the hospital and makes it a much deeper relationship and just is a much more holistic approach to solving a major set of problems for hospitals. On the back of that you will notice we recently announced a joint relationship with Hewlett Packard for additional businesses. This is the case now mirroring our medical space and expertise with additional partner with HP and it goes like this. HP has some tremendous technology in that space that is use to back up create the disaster recovery copy and take off side and ArchivesOne actually get a 2 for 1 value proposition for hospital, and drain down or reduce their own site storage cost dramatically. For their medical images archives, for the layman that means, CAT scans, MRIs and so forth. It is probably the fastest growing segment of additional data in the world. If your cost over 20 that and probably email. So there is a huge market opportunity, we are partner with HP, both and not just using their technology but it's a partnership in which we and at the HP sales force will excel into this platform and we are the service providers. So this is not the classic partnership where we bought their stuff and get to call at the partners here, this is much deeper much stronger relationship and we are pretty excited about that. We've just start the market, we've got a good pipeline, and I think we got about two customers up and running. So, its very early on... as excited as I am about that, this is a storage and a service business. What does that mean? It's an annuity business. That's the good news, the bad news is, it takes a long time to wrap up revenue recognition and the good news is once you do it just goes on for ever. And what we just added is a major lag in overtime we will continue to add to the flywheel of the business. And then last but not least, is the DMS business, something we started internal within Iron Mountain about 3-4 years ago. We created it with dedicated leadership and it is focus on integrating and leveraging our expertise from the digital side and the physical side and finding the... points for the integration of the two is important to our customers. That's our competitive advantage where we can make the two work together and we've created the platform, we've invested in the technology. In this case we didn't have to invent it, we can use a lot of people's technologies but we have built an infrastructure, we've built a knowledge set and we've got a nice business that's going well on us and a robust pipeline of opportunities out there. So what does that mean for this year, for 2008. Well as I go through the map because it all adds up in all kinds of ways but basically the guidance we put forward is the same guidance we gave you in Investor Day adjusted for the Stratify acquisition. It is guidance, its delivers within our long term objectives, we have set forth and we expect to do that year in and yea out. We feel good about the year. The questions you might ask is what, how do we think about the economy, we're not seeing it right now? Historically to remind those, we might see it if there is a recession but historically it, usually would, it's only had and service revenues primarily an primarily in the complimentary services space as customers have deferrable projects. It will also possibly hit us in some of our software sales base. There's some things we do to customers, license software and complimentary services can differ but what we're talking about would be an impact on our growth rate. It would be relatively small, it would be my forecast if at all and we're not yet seeing it and we feel strong about it that in our guidance, we still believe that we will operate within the range that we're putting forth that we have put forth and we will put forth regardless in the economy, that's our expectations as we set the date. So, we are and we remain a resilient business but of course we're not medium. And that's why we stand at the business, it was a great year. I appreciate the quarter of everybody else speak more about the transition after Bryan talks but let me get off the stage and give it to Bryan. Thank you.
Robert Brennan - Chief Executing Officer: Thanks Richard, good morning everybody. I am on page 3, the agenda slide, just to start Q4 was a solid quarter for Iron Mountain as we finished the year in line with our long term financial goals. Our agenda today is going to begin with the focus of our Q4 and full year P&L results and as part of that review, we'll discuss the key drivers of the Q4 results within the context of our full year performance. We'll also go through cash flow performance, capital spending trends and our year end debt position. And I'll conclude with an update of the preliminary 2008 guidance we provided Investor Day last October and show our outlook for the first quarter. Slide 4, highlights the key messages from today's review, Q4 kept the solid year of financial performance for Iron Mountain. For the full year, we had strong 16% revenue growth with gains across our portfolio supported by 10% internal growth and that is for our major acquisitions. We drove 14% order growth for the year excluding gains on disposition of assets comparable OIBDA grew 15%. We also saw improved capital efficiency in 2007. We're very pleased with this performance which is on track with our long term goals. In terms of our performance in the quarter we achieved strong revenue growth in Q4 above the high end of our guidance range. Total revenue growth of 19% was supported by solid internal growth of 10% including stronger than forecasted product revenues and favorable FX impacts. Additionally $3 million of revenue was contributed by our Stratify acquisition that closed in December. This revenue was not included in our original guidance for Q4 or for the full year 2007. For the quarter OIBDA was within our forecasted range as benefits from revenues upsides were offset by impacts from business mix and increase investments. We're also impacted by year end accruals for items such as workers compensation, medical claims, payroll taxes and incentive compensation which cumulatively were about $5 million above our forecast. In addition to $2 million of insurance gain we forecasted for the quarter was mostly offset by the right authorization of some internally developed software assets following Accutrac acquisition. Let's move on looking at the details of our performance on slide 5. Slide 5 compares results for this quarter to Q4 of 2006. Overall we had another solid revenue quarter supported by balance growth across our key business units which drove the overall increase of 19%. Our largest segment North America Physical, posted 17% growth overall. Internal revenue growth was solid at 9% supported by increasing growth in our secure shredding business, and continued to strength in special project revenues. Overall growth continues to benefit from the ArchivesOne, and RMS acquisitions. Our internal Physical business was up 29% overall, internal growth was 13% driven by high levels of complementary service revenue growth including benefits from large from a large public sector contract which will be ending in 2008. The international segment also benefited from acquisitions that strengthening our global footprint and comparable foreign exchange changes which together added 16% to revenue gains. We also continued to make progress in expanding our digital segment, supported by strong growth in storage revenues particularly in PC and distributors over back up and from benefits from the additional Stratify. In Q4 these gains offset relatively lower softer license sales compared to strong prior year levels and expected impact this year from declining market demand for data restoration projects. Revenue gains help drive a solid 17% year-on-year improvements in gross profit. Gross margins were up moderately for the quarter compared to the same prior year period. These factors driving the global performance included business mix as labor and transportation and tenser services such as shredding in DMS are growing faster than storage and acquisitions. SG&A growth is 20% in the quarter up slightly versus prior year levels to 28.9% of revenues. Cost was driven by, cost was driven by increase investment in the phase stronger revenue growth and the impact of higher compensation and benefit accruals noted earlier, including that for Q4 2006 in Q4 2007, our net gains on the disposition of assets of $10 million and $1 million respectively. Excluding these gains from both years OIBDA grew 15% year-over-year. Depreciation with $61 million and amortization was $8 million, slightly above expectations to Stratify acquisition, the finalization of purchase accounting for ArchivesOne and the acceleration of depreciation driven by a certain plan building moves. Operating income was a $115 million for Q4 2007. Flats of the prior year due to the increase in depreciation, amortization, I just spoke of and a $10 million gain on the asset sales reported in Q4 '06 that we will not repeat in 2007. Slide 6, breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions in foreign exchange which we have added about 9% and 6% high [ph] growth rates for the fourth quarter and full year respectively. Overall we continue to drive strong internal revenue growth of 10% for the quarter in the year. On a full year basis, our core internal, internal growth rates continue to track within our forecasted ranges. Storage internal growth continues as expected with a slightly lower growth rate in Q4 impacted by so much softer than targeted performance in our UK business. Core service remains strong lead by year and year improvements in our North America physical segment including higher growth rates in our shredding services revenues. Complimentary service continues to track above the high end of our range which contributes a strong overall internal growth performance this quarter. The key factors driving high complimentary revenue growth are the continued strength and recycled paper prices and higher levels of special project at JV in Q4 across the geographies. In Europe we realized about $25 million in revenues this year from two large public sector projects. As one of these projects is complete and the other is winding down, this will set up some lapping challenges in 2008. As we've noted in the past these types of changes can lead to largest swings in complementary revenue performance year-to-year. Further it is our complementary revenue that's most likely to be impacted by a slowing economy as company's look to may look to cut cost by differing or canceling new discretionary special projects. We continue to target solid complimentary service growth in special projects but given these factors we expect growth rates on this front to moderate next year. Moving on with our review of Q4 P&L performance, slide 7 bridges our Q4 operating income to net income and EPS results. Q4 results on these fronts were impacted by some select factors and comparisons to prior year one time items. As discussed operating income for the quarter was flat at $115 million impacted by comparisons to prior year results that included a $10 million gain on asset dispositions and increases and depreciation and amortization. G&A grew $15 million verses prior levels in Q4 reflecting increased CapEx spending, the Stratify acquisition, the finalization of purchase accounting for our ArchivesOne and the acceleration and depreciation driven by plan build in groups. Our Q4 interest expense increased comparatively Q4 2006 as expected driven primarily by increased debt for acquisitions most notably ArchivesOne, RMS and Stratify. Other expense were $6 million or $0.02 per share on Q4 primarily reflecting losses related to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we mark our inter company debt to market. Net income and EPS growth were impacted by an affected tax rate that exceeded our structural tax rate by nearly 8 points. As noted on our last call our estimated structural tax rate for Q4 was approximately 37%. We also noted that we likely see continued volatility in the effective tax rate lead to FX changes and other discreet items. That was the case in Q4. The entire increase in our effective tax rate over our structural tax rate this quarter was driven by the impact of foreign currency fluctuations during the quarter. The FX impact to the effective tax rate decreased our EPS by about $0.03 per share. Excluding impacts from discrete factors, we estimate our structural tax rate for 2008 to be approximately 36%. Turning to slide 8, let's look at our full year performance. You can see that in 2007, we posted strong results. Overall balance growth across our key businesses and service lines as well as favorable benefits from foreign exchange fluctuations this year supported strong mid teens revenue and OIBDA gains. Comparable OIBDA grew 15% when excluding gains on asset dispositions which were $5.4 million in 2007 and $10 million in 2006. And income was up 19% aided by a lower effective tax rate in 2007. Through the implementation of our global treasury program, we lowered our structural rate to 37% in '07. Our ETR was further reduced by benefits from FX changes and other discrete items which added about $0.07 to EPS this year. We are pleased with this performance which factor with our strategic financial goals for the year and is in line with our long term objectives. Lets shift now to reviewing drivers of our cash flow performances. Slide 9 summarizes our capital spending for the year it highlights our full year results compared to 2006 and our last outlook, which was issued on our Q3 earnings call. Our 2007 CapEx was $425 million within our forecast range including $46 million for real estate. Consistent with our long term financial goals we drove improved efficiency and our overall CapEx spend. With CapEx as a percentage of revenues down moderately in 2007 to 15.2%. Note that some of the efficiencies related to business mix, as we continue to see strong growth in our new services, which are less capital intensive than our core Physical business. These capital efficiencies offset the relatively lower margin characteristic of these services resulting in an attractive incremental return on investment. Our spending excluding real estate came in at $368 million, which was slightly over the top end of our projections. This is due primarily to the acceleration of certain projects around year-end particularly with respect to racking an IT projects including chain of cost duty and system monetization issues. As reminder these amount represent CapEx that was incurred and that's accrued during the year. Much of the Q4 CapEx was committed late in the quarter with actual cash payment schedule to occur in the first quarter of 2008. This factor benefit at our 2007 cash flow which I'll speak to more in the next slide. Slide 10 highlights our cash flow performance for the year compared to 2006. For 2007 we generated a $148 million of free cash flow before acquisitions in discretionary investments in real estate. The year-on-year increase in cash over reflects strong profit gains approximately $33 million of insurance proceeds related to one [indiscernible] and relatively low cash paid for CapEx in Q4 due to timing impacts which resulted in a $60 million year-end of CapEx or core balance. As noted these CapEx timing impacts will be reflected in our Q1 2008 cash flows. Looking ahead to 2008, we expect free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investment in real estate to be approximately $25 million to $75 million. The major difference between the 2007 and 2008 free cash flow was CapEx. Along with the 10% increase for forecasting for 2008, we have $60 million CapEx accrual I just spoke being paid in Q1. Additionally we are forecasting higher level of cash taxes in our '08 outlook. We are becoming a federal tax payer in 2008 as we've consume virtually all of our annuals. For the year we expect to pay approximately $50 million in cash taxes, compared to the $34 million we paid in 2007. Keeping in mind that free cash flow is best looked at on a full year basis as the timing of certain cash events is not consistent throughout the year. For example, the first quarter is for '08, it's historically our lowest cash flow quarter will be impacted by the CapEx accrual and the payment of annual bonuses. Now let's turn to slide 7, to review our debt statistics. In terms of our debt portfolio, we ended 2007 with solid progress across our key metrics. As you can see in the slide, interest is down slightly to 7.4% and we're 75% fixed. Consolidated leverage is at 4.5 times within our target range of 4 to 5 times OIBDA. Maturity is now at 7.2 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2012. Our liquidity is also strong. In November, we exercised the Cordian [ph] feature embedded within our senior credit agreement. As a result we increased our available senior credit by $300 million representing a $190 million of additional capacity on a revolving credit facility and $110 million of additional senior term loans. As of December 31st 2007, we have more than $485 million of cash and availability under revolving credit facility. Now let's move to slide 13, which begins the discussion of our 2008 guidance. Our performance objectives for 2008 were developed within the long term financial framework we shared at Investor Day, shown here in the left-hand chart. Looking ahead to 2008, our guidance remains consistent with these goals which were based around some key things. First, we're biased for growth and intend to invest against the range of attractive growth opportunities we see for Iron Mountain. Secondly, we're committed to driving consistently strong revenue and OIBDA gains, as we advance our expansion strategy. And finally, we will drive strong incremental returns on investment supported by improved capital efficiency over the next five years. For 2008, we are targeting moderate gains in terms of capital spending as a percentage of revenues, despite some significant planed investments in datacenter capacity. The only significant change to our 2008 outlook is the addition of the Stratify acquisition that we closed last December. As we noted in our last call, we expect Stratify to generate in the range of $40 million in revenues without being accretive to profits in 2008, due to impact of acquisition integration costs. Let's now turn to slide 14 and take a look, closer look at our 2008 guidance. Here you can see the current revenue and OIBDA growth ranges, we are now expecting for 2008, compared to the ranges outlined at Investor day. Again the only significant adjustment is the inclusion of the expected results of the Stratify acquisition. Please note that OIBDA growth rates are adjusted for impacts from gains or losses on asset dispositions. Our CapEx outlook in dollars is unchanged, as the impact of CapEx being accelerated into 2007 more than offset the additional CapEx associated with Stratify. As a reminder included in the 2008 outlook is approximately $20 million for expanded datacenter capacity to support the future growth of our digital business. That's our CapEx outlook. We are committed to driving performance in these ranges, despite potential impacts from tougher economic conditions. While we expect to weather on economic downturn better than most, we are not immune to the recessionary environment and we may see the effects of the slowing economy on some of our more discretionary revenue streams, such as special projects and other ancillary services. Let's move on to slide 15 and take a look... closer look at our revenue expectations. The table on slide 15 shows our expectations for internal growth and total growth in 2008, including impacts from FX [ph] and acquisitions. Overall, we are projecting revenue gains in the 10% to 13% range supported by 7% to 9% internal growth. We are targeting solid core revenue growth in 2008 inline with our 2007 performance and our long-term objectives. We do expect lower growth in complementary services this year. This outlook reflects difficult comparisons to 2007 with respect to special project particularly in North America and in Europe and recycle paper revenues as we expect the price to be more stable in 2008. Note that the impacts of the European public sector project lapping that issue alone is about 5 percentage points in our complimentary services growth rate and nearly a point in our overall internal growth rate. Despite these impacts we're targeting a strong overall growth consistent with our long-term financial goals. Let's look at these growth projections by business segments. Slide 16 highlights our expectations for internal growth rate across our three business segments. For our North America Physical business, we are expecting 2008 internal growth to be within the 7% and 9% range. This outlook reflects consistent performance in core revenue growths supported by continued strength in our shredding services business. Offsetting these gains of difficult comps and complementary services, particularly special project and recycle paper revenues. For international physical segment, we are projecting internal growth in the 6% to 8% range. 2007 was a good year in international supported by high growth rates and complementary services, reflecting benefits from two large government projects. As we've already discussed one these projects has ended and the other is ending shortly thereby setting up lapping issues for the year. Additionally, we are working to drive UK's growth rates to more appropriate levels. Finally, we are expecting to see improvement in the internal growth of our worldwide digital segment. Our digital data protection business continues to perform very well overall and we're looking for expansion in the growth rates of our digital archiving and intellectual property management services. Moving on to slide 17, we can see how the growth ranges we are driving towards translate into dollars for the full year, as well as for Q1. For the full year 2008, we're expecting revenues to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.08 billion. OIBDA be in the range of $763 million to $791 million and CapEx to be between $440 million and $480 million, as noted, internal growth is expected to between 7% and 9%. Please note that our fist quarter and full year guidance includes expectations for a $3 million charge on a plan to asset disposition. When considering the Q1 guidance, remember that in the first quarter, we'll be feeling the diluted impact of the Stratify acquisition and the other major acquisitions completed after the first quarter of 2007, primarily ArchivesOne, RMS, Accutrac and [indiscernible]. Q1 OIBDA will also be impacted by some carryover impacts from investments initiated in the fourth quarter. Note that OIBDA in the first quarter is historically impacted by a higher mix of labor and transportation and intensive service revenues, seasonally higher energy costs and fully loaded payroll taxes and incentive compensation expense. Finally, on slide 18 we present our expectations for the full P&L below the OIBDA line for the full year 2008. An important item to note here is the tax rate. We are expecting our structural tax rate to be 36% for 2008. As we said earlier, we are likely to see continued variability in the effective tax rate with FX changes and other discreet items such as tax law change and changes to our tax reserves. As discussed earlier, FX changes added about $0.07 per share for EPS in 2007. We also saw $0.02 per share net benefit in 2007 rate from net gains and asset dispositions. Our 2008 EPS guidance assumes no benefits from discreet tax items and has noted a sum [ph] of $3 million or 1/5 per share as negative impact from a planned asset disposition charge in Q1. Thanks and I'll now turn the call back over to Richard.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Bryan and before I go to questions. I and of course Bob's here with me. We will make just a couple of comments about the announcement as we exercised our succession plan with Iron Mountain. First is, held couple of key cashes [ph], what's happening and why right now I'll try to answer those for you briefly. What is happening is Christine Eyre [ph] and I informed the Board that I thought it was the appropriate time that we exercised our succession plan that we build out over time. And that that plan would be is that Bob take on the roll as President, Chief Executive Officer for the company and I would move to a role of the Executive Chairman. The title of Executive Chairman and I will speak to myself is pretty easy to talk about, what Bob's said going to do for everybody's clarity; he will run the company, not me. But as the Executive Chairman, I will be a full time employee of the company. I'm not going anywhere until I hey throw me out. They haven't decided to do that yet. But, I wanted to focus my time and it's hard to be out in the hot seat of the CEO and stay totally focused on the key issues that I think are important that I think I have the most leverage at this stage of the company and this stage of my career to focus on one of these product and in that case embracing and inculcating our products with the 26 years knowledge that our... not just me personally, but by organization has build up and I want to stress this is not just me personally, but I kind of know where all the knowledge, most of the knowledge pockets are and I'm going to start following together and help organize those, because it's going to be a real factor of us really taking our competitive advantage and really getting that out in the market place. And of course focused on customers I've done a lot of customers work in last year too and I want to do more. I know that's a great feedback into the product space and it's also a useful... use of my time and talent. And last and certainly not least is advising the Board and as a Chairman help leading the company to the next phase of our business, but also being an advisor to Bob, for those of you haven't been watching carefully, you will note that Bob and I have been working as a partnership for the last couple of years with this eventuality without a the certain date at all, but with the eventuality of just doing this in mind and I will tell you that I haven't made a... I haven't made any important decision without discussion and getting it advised in council. Since he's been here for the matter, but I don't expect you will make an important decision for the next few years without my advice in the council. Bob, I mean go ahead Bob.
Bob Brennan - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes we will more to... it's interesting, sitting here, listening to, we've known each other for five years.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Bob Brennan - President and Chief Operating Officer: We've been working together day and night. Everyday for 3.5 years, we've built up a team together. We refined our strategy and our execution plans together and you've been teaching me the business I'd to learn this from a lot of people, but specifically you, so this is not used --
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: AndI don't for this to our organization that's the message we are getting as we brought started to roll that, starting late last night and into this morning. So I want to stress a couple of message that this is normal succession. I we are doing it for the right time and the right reasons. The question you might ask that why not now why year ago, one is that two years from now, I'll be 62 years old in about a week and a half or two weeks something like that. But I still got more energy than most, but now what I used to have quite candidly, and the speed of the pact is always at the pace of the leader and I can look forward to declining energy because I can look back to I have had declining energy. And this company needs a leader that describes significant energy to take it forward, because the opportunity is just too big, not to go get it and I'm not about to let us miss that opportunity. So right now it's a right time for me, the right time for the company, because I know some significant things that need to be done that I want to focus on and standing. [Technical Difficulty]. We are getting tremendous feedback on our line.
Operator: Yes sir. Management is hearing that.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Do you hear that feedback operator?
Operator: Yes sir.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Can you do anything about it?
Operator: I'm trying now sir. [Technical Difficulty].
Unidentified Company Representative: Operator can you hear me now? That is like a [indiscernible]. Operator?
Operator: Yes sir.
Unidentified Company Representative: We are going to hang up and dial you right back if you ask the participants to please give them a technical difficulty notice and put them on hold. While I will make sure, can you hear me clearly now?
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I gather the operator cannot hear us. If there everybody else there can hear us, we're going to hang up and come back. We apologize but not our, [indiscernible]. We will rise [ph] again traffic check. [Technical Difficulty].
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Operator. Okay I've told that you can hear me. I apologize, but we did do it. Let me finish and then we'll get on with it because I realize that time has got long. I thinking we didn't do it. Let me finish and then we will get on with it, because I realize that time is getting long [ph]. I was explaining to you what I was going to do and why and I was explaining to you why timing is now and it's partly for me, personally, but it's mostly about it's the right time for the company and last but certainly not the least as Bob is ready and I do want to spend a second explaining my decision to recommend Bob for this role that probably I didn't make that decision and board did agree, of course. But there is really three ways I'll look at it. Bob is a better executor than I am, it's just that simple and that's what the company needs for the next evolution, because the company is much more complex where it needs a different way of thinking about it. For those who watch this carefully, you'll see that his influence and execution has made us a better company. And I expect he will continue to enhance that. Bob has built out a significant team, because he's good at doing that and we have the right people to go forward. He's learned the business. He's got the intellectual curiosity to learn the business and he has learned it. Does he know it as well as I've known, no and he never will and that's fine. Because it took me 26 years, but he's learned what it takes, he's learned the important side of it. But last and most important, he's the right kind of human being. He fits the culture of Iron Mountain and he fits the culture of what I believe is important to at least our long term shareholders and that is he understands the balance of value creation, running the balance between shareholders and employees and customers and the fact that you have to actually meet the needs of all those. And he does and he flies the mission, that's the only thing, that's... it's a term I use, but one thing I have learned in my long years is what really cuts the really, really good people from just the great people from the good people is when you have a problem, when you have an issue, a lot of managers and I see this is in our customers all the time, they like to phone it in and they like to delegate it. But if it's important, the CEO flies the mission and shows up and Bob has that in him, so and for all those reasons he's the right guy. And I'm not going anywhere so and I will do things those accepting the emails, both employees, as well as shareholders but I... it's almost like that [indiscernible] didn't read the message. I've got a full time job. I'm hanging in around the work until till I'm needed any longer and right now I think they need me so I am here to stay. With that let me turn it over to Bob.
Bob Brennan - President and Chief Operating Officer: You guys have a couple of comments pictured, thanks to your partnership and fixing your confidence, the confidence of the Board of Directors and the senior team and taking on this role. I do look forward to seeing more, even being more external in this new role. I will be more external with our customers as well as with our investors and working with you in the years to come. What Brian had said what I have said, what Richard said what I want to know more than anything else is that we are capably committed to providing consistent long term financial performance and I will reporting to you on that and working with you in the years to come. Okay with that hopefully the technologies working where we are getting some messages that the, we can't get the operators asking for Q&A and I'm going to turn it over to the operator and help that she ask for your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of David Gold with Sidoti. Please precede, sir.
David Gold - Sidoti & Company, LLIRM: Hi good morning.
Unidentified Company Representative: Hi David morning.
David Gold - Sidoti & Company, LLIRM: ouple of questions for you. First Bob, the plan right now which are due about to maintain the roles of President and COO as well.
Unidentified Company Representative: The COO positions David will not be back really because we feel about the team we feel very good about the TNL leaders that we have in the America's, Europe, digital Asia-Pac, Latin America's seems to build out.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah. In fact we created if you go back and remember in time Bob was President of North America and then I ask him to step in the COO specifically created that role to putting him in a position of they tested him quite frankly with more importantly for him to learn and he's certainly passed the test and he certainly learned but that was not a long-term load in our remarks.
David Gold - Sidoti & Company, LLIRM: I see as far as President keeping that.
Unidentified Company Representative: He will be the President and Chief Executive Officer; I'll be the Executive Chairman.
David Gold - Sidoti & Company, LLIRM: Perfect and then question probably for Brian. On the first quarter margins were off better than the guidance, I guess if I look at the year guidance implies goal with 25 and I'll say 26.5%, 27% margin for the first quarter, looks like you're implying 22% to 24%. Just curious if you can sort of add in I mean Stratify hits you little bit but it doesn't seem like its should hit you that much if a, you can some color on that what specific for the first quarter dragging you down. And then b, a sense of presumably the expectation would for ramp-up throughout the rest of the year to get to the guidance.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes we will try to talk a bit about this on the call but there is some normal seasonality in the business where in the first quarter you have things like over higher impacts from energy cost or mix of business is more labor cost intensive and you have things like the full impact of IT accruals and payroll taxes so there is normal seasonality that goes on. And this year year-on-year as well we do have a impact of a couple of over factors, one is they dilute impact of acquisitions not just Stratify, the some other acquisitions that we completed after Q1 last year, and we do have some carryover investments spend that we initiated some investments in Q4 and we'll see some of those impacts carrying over into Q1. One other one time item of know to which we highlighted in the call we do expect that $3 million charge in Q1 related to a sale of the building. So some of those all go up and that I will spend in the Q1 number we are very much committed to delivering strong full year performance, that's what we are focused on and we are committed to deliver result in that range.
David Gold - Sidoti & Company, LLIRM: Okay and I mean I guess, specifically Stratify was first quarterish, in year-on-year adjustment seasonality is basically significantly down year-to-year and from the acquisition front and presumably if we expect it to make some decent progress for the year.
Unidentified Company Representative: We are just down to $3 million one time loss and really the balance of the delta is the comp some total of acquisition impacts and some of the carry over investments fronts effect.
David Gold - Sidoti & Company, LLIRM: Okay and just one other, in the fourth quarter, the year end comp benefit adjustment presumably overtime, we think that would be end of every year factor and I guess just curious, have there been changes in compensation particularly this year or was it just particularly good year and we didn't accrued as much as direct the [indiscernible]
Unidentified Company Representative: It was one I want to be clear it wasn't one adjustment, it was a number of smaller adjustments in a variety of areas. It's not unusual for us to make year end drop to these estimates. It just happen as the adjustments of all kind of moved to one... in one way and they sum to a meaningful numbers, so this was a different kind of forecast it was $5 million without that we wouldn't have been behind it, the year remains, we were surprised by that if you will but its not any an issue within the business, its just the sum total of the number of adjustments that were made at year end.
David Gold - Sidoti & Company, LLIRM: Fair enough. Thank you all.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Michel Morin with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Yes good morning, couple of quick questions. First the minority interest was large this quarter. In fact the first loss in a very long time, is that a result of some of the recent investments that are being made in investments something we should assume or continue for the foreseeable future?
Unidentified Company Representative: We are investing in our international growth and we do expect some negative impacts from those investments as we build out, this is as Richard's thought. Quite a bit of [indiscernible], it's a long term build for storage and we will see a consumer yield from that with those investments over time so I think what you're seeing is just some of that impact.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Okay and then similar kind of, and asset disposition usually those of head and tail gains, is there anything specific here that makes this one of it different than others? I'm talking about the Q1 and the plan that singled out?
Unidentified Company Representative: Nothing unusual we do see a gain and we'll see a book losses on asset disposition as well. Its normal activity in terms of changing our where we're locating our facilities and we're going to see a book loss related to a move that we're going to make over next year. Early this year.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And in terms of the planned building moves that you also talked about in the release. Is that also associated with the acquisition, the recent acquisition?
Unidentified Company Representative: No, that was your referring to some of the higher DNA and Q4 and that wasn't specific acquisitions for just the some adjustments, we made our depreciation and amortization related to some of those numbers.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Okay, thanks very much.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with Bear Stearns. Please proceed.
Andrew Steinerman - Bear, Stearns & Company: Hi, gentlemen. Its little of the same subject of how do we connect out of full year margins of being steady, first quarter margin being dragged by those three things, seasonality, dilution for acquisition and investment. If you could just sort of quantify which pieces of those will start going away in the second, third, fourth quarter. I think it would be a little clear and I thought I heard because investment part will continue to carry forward.
Unidentified Company Representative: I think we are just in context we are focused very much on our full year objectives Andrew and I think the, some of the impacts that we will see through the year we will start to get through some of the lapping of the diluted acquisitions that were done later in the year, I think we'll see relatively bigger impact from investments and growth year-on-year early in 2008, those will be the factors contributing but we are comfortable with our full year outlook and very much committed to delivering in that range.
Andrew Steinerman - Bear, Stearns & Company: Right to make a full year of steady margins with margins being down so much in the first quarter, you really have to kind of get margin ramping pretty much so I think right after the first quarter.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, we are comfortable with what our full year outlook implies and we are committed to delivering the number.
Andrew Steinerman - Bear, Stearns & Company: Okay and just one more clarification. When we are talking about gross margins, I heard next day in the press release that sort of net, when it gets the company sliding shredding in DMC, are those businesses really big enough that buy themselves the faster would be so significant in terms of gross margins.
Unidentified Company Representative: I think the, they are reasonably significant parts of our business and in terms of the relative mix and what we had on the year-on-year basis we continue to see that stronger service growth as bigger services bigger part of mix relative to storage and that had some dilutive impact on our gross margin in Q4.
Andrew Steinerman - Bear, Stearns & Company: I though that international growth would have been more important next factor than shredding growth for we are just thinking about gross margins.
Unidentified Company Representative: Okay while we had our strong service growth in international markets as well, that effect will be.
Andrew Steinerman - Bear, Stearns & Company: Okay thanks for all the clarification. I appreciate it.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you Andrew.
Operator: And your final question comes form the lines of Scott Schneeberger, with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.: Hey good afternoon. Could you, you guys keep alluding to these increased investments? Could you give a little bit of color better impact a fourth quarter and in the first something, it sounds like things are taper off in second half as you've mentioned but you could us a little more color in what they are in?
Unidentified Company Representative: We talked a bit about this as we on a last call talking about some of the things that we are advancing in terms of our phase in for Q4 but we are investing an increase systems capability including support of whole lot of oracle financials in international markets. We are rolling out time and attentive systems to been the manager. Our labor cost, we got investments since operating systems to improve or mange in the transportation and chain of custody and we are continued to invest against our security capability to meet our customer requirements. So you know sum total those are the big themes, we had talked that we are going to do some phasing into Q4, this year some that is carrying over to Q1, that's impacting our outlook.
Unidentified Company Representative: And we are investing heavily in security because we believe that our investors will all our competitors combined and that we will be able to expect value for that in the obvious once those specimens are made.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, thanks in the starting business, could you speak to what your expectations are for used paper prices year-over-year and with whatever granularity you can provide us. Obviously we are working for something that serve here we're going to comparison and then as a follow up to that how is the competitive environment and do you believe that you can get pricing on servicing if you see a slide in the newspaper prices. Thanks.
Unidentified Company Representative: But when I take the first one, and then I ask, let Bob comment on the competitive environment but you know the paper prices are turning in the $200 type range and we've seen that quite often a bit. We are basically projecting a, a maintenance of those kind of levels going and the balance of the year end and so we will see less benefit from growth and paper prices this year and that had a meaningful benefit to our 2007 growth rate. So that's some of the explanation in terms of where the, the complimentary revenue growth won't be as sizeable this year. And the paper price market of, the paper market itself is undergoing structural changes, that are good for a long, that are bit long term and truth is we have never been through recession under the solid new structure then. Structure changes is enormous amount of volume now in the recycle paper markets going offshore to China as the mills over there and it is their primary source [indiscernible]. So, it used to be five years ago, when we were already, I guess seven years ago, with as far as the business go like that. In majority the paper stake in the U.S. demand at the paper. But lot of it goes off shore and because of that its just driven the prices up because there's a worldwide shortage of fiber. What our recession will do with that if we have such recession and it remains on the, we're just trying to be conservative and not certainly and certainly considering going higher. On your other question about paper prices come down, the services prices go up, historically what we've seeing there is yes, because we have seen service prices come down as paper prices going up. Okay, historically you'll see a short turn around but there will always be the classic lag and there was a lag coming into it is paper prices rose, it took a lot of our service prices to come off it. They'll be a lag the other way, paper prices com down, the last time I saw this when paper prices took a big dip what you saw was a lot of small vendors go out of business and a lot of recycles pull back out of the business. The business that was changed some other ways [indiscernible] and that is there's a lot of different markets and I won't go through them and I don't need your graphic markets and the segments and how do you think about it. We are focused in a couple of segments. One is particularly is the large multi city customer that we were buying the service as the compliance offering because we use leveraging our footprint to do that and we think it will it's a different value proposition and by the way a tightly price market but a very high value markets.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thanks. One final one, realize energy prices are going to be seasonally high in the first quarter and obviously they are up good debt in the first quarter year-over-year, you just can you give us any thoughts on how that effects you overall and say as a percent of revenue and what you are looking for the year thanks?
Unidentified Company Representative: Our energy cost are basically in the range of 2% to 3% of our revenues and so there that can have an impact I mean we do have some ability to recover changes cost through things like fuel surcharges with our customers but we think a reasonable outlook on energy cost, that's factored into our sides [ph].
Unidentified Company Representative: And can you give you me some sense, of Bob there is rough numbers for about half our energy cost goes to rolling side of transportation and about half of it goes towards our building so forth in. As Brian said everyone in the world but we are getting there but certainly North America we've been rolling this out, we've got quite within place over the last year or so as when you renew contracts and so forth and energy I guess hedged against prices up and down its fair deal for the customers from the transportation side.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.: Alright thanks very much.
Unidentified Company Representative: Okay thanks.
Operator: And you have a follow-up from the line Michel Morin with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Michel Morin - Merrill Lynch: Yes thanks for taking the follow-up question. Richard I think in your comments you mentioned that you're seeing another rounds, rounds to for role up in U.S., can you elaborate a bit more on that. Is this coming from private equity investors and you seem to think that it's a net positive for you and I struggle a little bit to understand how that can be?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well look that is competitors of the local gas. There is nobody tougher than a last period. Okay nobody, so the more there is take out better competitive data is quite [ph] once driving it, it's a great business there, there is yes its private equity. There is this four groups that will probably come at a leverage fees, companies I would expect there will be to drive good returns. The more intelligent capital that comes into business that returning, the better it is for everybody and so that we see that it is already around, don't just respect and this competitors as always. That's that I am going to say is that private owners are always a tougher competitors.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.: Alright thanks very much.
Operator: At this time there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Richard Reese for closing remarks.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Michael for early, [indiscernible] wanted to ask a question. We got a strange communication platform right here.
Operator: Yes sir, he remains off from the line.
C. Richard Reese - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay sorry to do that but just want to make sure by heading of. First I apologize for being long I committed sometime ago to keep this call an hour. I broke my commitment. I apologize that we did have a loss recover given in the announcements and given the year end. Just to the summary business is running well, I understand you want to look in the numbers everything else. We are committed to running this business. To hit our annual targets and hit our long term targets. I have never seen the business and the better position last few day, I am pleased for operating, I'm happy with what we are doing and we are making real progress strategically. We are well positioned to the year 2008 and we are committed to delivering in the result and I think we have the thing to do it. So I do appreciate your support. I want to relate one more last time though I'm still planning to be around so, hopefully I will see many of you, you will see me missing out from the shareholder. I can't avoid it for have a little around that so, look forward to see you occasionally, less often but occasionally and thank you for your support and I will talk to you next quarter. Thank you.
